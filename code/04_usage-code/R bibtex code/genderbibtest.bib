Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate the occurrence and to assess the determinants of
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in flood victims.
   Method: We carried out a retrospective study to examine the occurrence
   and the determinants of PTSD in victims of flood in 1998 and 1999 in
   Hunan, China. We used multistage sampling to select the subjects from
   the flood areas, and we ascertained PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria.
   Data were collected in face-to-face interviews carried out by
   experienced research assistants using a preconstructed questionnaire. We
   used a multiple logistic regression model to analyze the data.
   Results: A total of 33 340 subjects (86.0\% of the selected subjects,
   aged 7 years or over) in the study villages were interviewed. Among
   them, 2875 (8.6\%) had symptoms that met the diagnostic criteria for
   PTSD. Significant risk factors for PTSD included female sex (odds ratio
   {[}OR] 1.12; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.04 to 1.21), older age
   (age 18 to 59 years OR 2.28; 95\%CI, 2.02 to 2.57, and age >= 60 years
   OR 2.42; 95\%CI, 2.05 to 2.85), flood type (collapsed embankment OR
   1.84; 95\%CI, 1.64 to 2.05, and flash flood OR 3.12; 95\%CI, 2.76 to
   3.52), and flood severity (intermediate OR 4.05; 95\%CI, 3.55 to 4.62,
   and severe OR 2.98; 95\%CI, 2.60 to 3.41).
   Conclusions: PTSD is a common mental disorder in flood victims, which
   implies the need for improved health services, especially mental health
   services, for this population.}},

Abstract = {{Chitral is a landlocked and mountainous region of northern Pakistan
   located in the Hindu Kush mountains, with a total population of around
   400,000 in 50,000 households. The inhabitants of Chitral face a variety
   of problems associated with climatic hazards throughout the year, such
   as heavy snowfall in winter, flash floods in summer, glacial outbursts,
   soil erosion, landslides, occasional earthquakes, and subsequent
   outbreaks of disease. In such a fragile environment, the collective
   action of local communities through grassroots institutions-Village and
   Women's Organizations (V/WOs) and the second generation of these
   institutions, Local Support Organizations (LSOs)-has been instrumental
   in effectively tackling these problems. LSOs play the role of a
   laboratory for engagement by civil society and developing institutional
   mechanisms to address development challenges, including natural hazards
   and disasters in the area.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to analyse and compare the loss of life that occurred
   during two recent floods in France. The first flood was due to a sea
   surge triggered by the storm called Xynthia that hit the Atlantic coast
   on 28 February 2010 (41 flood-related deaths). The second was a flash
   flood that struck the Var Department in the French Mediterranean region
   on 15 June 2010 (26 fatalities). After detailing the assumptions and
   expected outcomes of the study of disaster-related fatalities, the paper
   focuses on the characteristics of the victims and the circumstances of
   their deaths. In the first case, 71\% of the victims were people aged
   over 60 (mainly women) who were surprised while they were sleeping and
   who died in or near their homes. In the case of the flash flood, the
   profiles of the victims were diverse as the flooding occurred in the
   afternoon and many people were trapped in open. The paper also
   highlights the factors that explain mortality. Physical factors such as
   water depth were determined. The relationship between the water depth
   and the age of victims was found to be relevant. In the case of the
   storm surge Xynthia, the correlation between age and water depth is
   positive. For the flash flood, the correlation between age and water
   depth was negative as male adults died in open. In the first case, the
   vulnerability of people was closely linked to human features such as
   type of housing and age that people are not directly responsible for.
   During flash floods, dangerous behaviour by people highlighted the role
   of risk-taking in loss of life. We also examined the particular case of
   the deaths of the children. The paper concludes by discussing the
   factors of vulnerability on frail population such as elderly people or
   marginalized. The lack of risk awareness and crisis preparedness were
   clearly a major factor of vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{A significant number of crashes on roads are caused by adverse weather
   conditions. Among the most serious consequences of rainfall and flooding
   in regard to road safety are the motor vehicle-related flash flood
   fatalities. These fatalities are of particular concern in Texas.
   Information on motor vehicle fatalities caused by flash floods was
   extracted from the National Climatic Data Center Storm Data reports.
   Review of reports on flash flood fatalities in general, where the death
   circumstances are provided, reveals that most fatalities are motor
   vehicle-related (80\%). Moreover, data from the reports indicate that
   from 1959 to 2009 the number of motor vehicle-related flash flood
   fatalities in Texas exceeds by far the total number of flood fatalities
   in any other state. Demographic analysis of the flash flood fatalities
   indicates that, in Texas, all ages are at risk and that males are much
   more affected than females. Spatial analysis indicates that the highest
   numbers of fatalities occur in counties having major urban areas. The

Abstract = {{Background: Heavy rainfall in northern India in August 2010 caused flash
   floods, seriously damaging homes and infrastructure. There have been no
   major disasters in the history of Ladakh, and no surveys on
   post-disaster psychiatric disorders have been conducted in this area.
   Aims and methods: To examine the impact of this disaster in Ladakh one
   month post-disaster, we visited Choglamsar, located near the town of
   Leh, where the flood had the most severe impact. In total, 318 survivors
   (mean age: 58.6 years; female-male ratio: 59.7\%; Tibetan refugees:
   86.2\%) participated in the survey. We used the two-item Patient Health
   Questionnaire (PHQ-2) along with questions covering background
   characteristics and disaster exposure. A psychiatrist interviewed the
   survivors with a single or double positive score in the PHQ-2 or with
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
   Results and conclusion: There were only two PTSD cases and five of major
   depressive disorders. PTSD and depression were less common in the
   Tibetan cultural areas than in other areas. The social background and
   temperamental characteristics of the Tibetan culture may play a
   suppressive role in psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{We report findings from a mixed method study of women's gendered
   experiences with flash floods in the coastal city of Lagos, Nigeria.
   Drawing on narrative accounts from 36 interviews, a survey (n = 453) and
   6 focus group discussions, we investigate the impacts of floods in
   general and specifically the July 2011 flood event on women's lives,
   livelihoods, and health. We draw on complementary perspectives from
   feminist political ecology and social vulnerability theory to understand
   the ways in which such events are perceived, experienced and managed by
   women of different socio-economic classes, households, and geographic
   locations. Thematic and content analyses were used to examine women's
   perceptions of floods, while descriptive statistical analysis and
   chi-square test were employed to compare actual impacts. Results show
   that women in general expressed no concern about gendered vulnerability
   to flooding as most believed flood impacts were gender neutral. This
   dominant view however, was not supported by evidence in the post-July
   2011 flooding as impacts varied among income groups and neighbourhoods,
   and gender differences were apparent. Women in the low-income
   neighbourhood recorded higher impacts and slower recovery compared to
   other social categories of women and men. All impacts reported were
   statistically significant between women in low and high income
   neighbourhoods but most were not significant between women in middle and
   high income neighbourhoods. Gender relations and roles intersecting with
   place, class, employment status, and healthcare, were mediating factors
   that placed low-income women at greater risk of impacts than others.
   With climate change likely to induce more extreme events, a case is made
   for collaborative and institutional efforts to systematically boost
   urban poor women's adaptive capacity through targeted programmes aimed
   at alleviating poverty and improving women's access to housing, health
   care and alternative sources of livelihoods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Identifying the risk factors for morbidity and mortality effects pre-,
   during and post-flood may aid the appropriate targeting of flood-related
   adverse health prevention strategies. We conducted a systematic PubMed
   search to identify studies examining risk factors for health effects of
   precipitation-related floods, among Organisation for Economic
   Co-Operation and Development (OECD) member countries. Research
   identifying flood-related morbidity and mortality risk factors is
   limited and primarily examines demographic characteristics such as age
   and gender. During floods, females, elderly and children appear to be at
   greater risk of psychological and physical health effects, while males
   between 10 to 29 years may be at greater risk of mortality. Post-flood,
   those over 65 years and males are at increased risk of physical health
   effects, while females appear at greater risk of psychological health
   effects. Other risk factors include previous flood experiences, greater
   flood depth or flood trauma, existing illnesses, medication
   interruption, and low education or socio-economic status. Tailoring
   messages to high-risk groups may increase their effectiveness. Target
   populations differ for morbidity and mortality effects, and differ pre-,
   during, and post-flood. Additional research is required to identify the
   risk factors associated with pre- and post-flood mortality and
   post-flood morbidity, preferably using prospective cohort studies.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are the leading cause of fatalities connected with natural
   disasters in Texas. A combination of physiography and precipitation
   often result in extreme hydrologic conditions that cause floods in the
   state. This paper reviews flood-related fatalities in Texas between 1959
   and 2008. Information on flood-fatality victims and the flood-causing
   events was obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. The data
   collected included the date, time, location, and weather conditions and
   the gender and age of the flood victims. Comparison with other states
   reveals that the size of the population of Texas is a major factor in
   the increased number of fatalities. The data also suggest that driving
   or walking into floodwaters may be responsible for more than 93\% of
   flood fatalities in Texas. Although most high-fatality counties are
   located in the Texas ``Flash Flood Alley{''} that includes major urban
   centers, normalization of fatality data shows that the flood-fatality
   risk is actually higher in other areas of the state. The analysis also
   indicates that the annual flood-fatality rates are decreasing
   significantly. A combination of improved hydrometeorological
   forecasting, educational programs aimed at enhancing public awareness of
   flood risk and the seriousness of flood warnings, and timely and
   appropriate action by local emergency and safety authorities will help
   further reduce flood fatalities in Texas. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{We have measured livelihoods vulnerability indices for four disaster
   prone zones in Bangladesh, namely saline, flood, flash flood and
   drought. A total of 2558 households were surveyed to collect data on
   socio-demographics, livelihoods, social networks, health, food and water
   security, natural disasters and climate variability. The data were
   aggregated using a composite index and vulnerabilities across the four
   disaster prone areas were compared. Our results show that the flash
   flood zone is the most vulnerable zone followed by the saline, drought
   and flood zones respectively. The flash flood zone is mainly a mono-rice
   crop area and local livelihood opportunities are uncertain and limited.
   Road infrastructure is poor as a large part of this zone remains under
   water in the wet season. Public health services are underprovided and
   the hospitals are understaffed, sanitary conditions are poor and the
   households suffer a longer period of food insecurity. The poor
   households living in the saline zone have to depend more on social
   networks and local authorities to withstand livelihood shocks brought
   about by natural disasters such as tidal surges, cyclones and increasing
   salinity. The drought and saline zones are highly vulnerable to water.
   Water in these zones is not only scarce but also unsafe for drinking.
   The saline zone also suffers from salinity in water used for irrigation
   which has already affected productivity of land. We suggest an increase
   in public spending on sanitation and drinking water, health and rural
   infrastructure particularly in the disaster prone areas where incidence
   of poverty is high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study was undertaken to review international literature pertaining to
   people's behavior in and around floodwater. The review focused on
   people's voluntary entry of floodwater. From the literature, five
   predominant reasons for entering floodwater were identified, including
   undertaking a recreational activity; attempting to reach a destination;
   retrieving property, livestock, or pets; undertaking employment duties;
   and rescuing or assisting with evacuation. Two primary influences on
   entering floodwater were found, namely risk perception (i.e., being
   unaware of or underestimating the risk from flooding) and social
   influences (i.e., being influenced by others). Demographics and
   environmental and temporal factors also played a part in decision-making
   about whether to enter floodwater or not. Emergency managers should take
   account of such factors when devising future public education
   strategies. Further research, including comparisons with current
   theoretical models, could help identify additional influences on
   decision-making for floodwater entry.}},

Abstract = {{Social impacts caused by floods and landslides in Portugal in the period
   of 1865-2010 are gathered in the DISASTER database. This database
   contains 1,902 hydro-geomorphologic cases that caused 1,248 fatalities
   (81\% and 19\% associated with floods and landslides, respectively). The
   use of the DISASTER database allowed for: (i) the analysis of the
   frequency and the temporal evolution of fatal floods and landslides;
   (ii) the analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of fatalities;
   (iii) the identification of the most deadly flood and landside types;
   (iv) the verification of gender tendencies in mortalities; and (v) the
   evaluation of individual and societal risk. The highest number of flood
   and landslide cases and related mortalities occurred in the period of
   1935-1969. After this period, the number of flood and landslide
   mortalities decreased, although landslide fatalities remained higher
   than those registered in the period of 1865-1934. The occurrence of
   flood fatalities was widespread in the country, with an important
   cluster in the Lisbon region and in the Tagus valley, while fatalities
   caused by landslides mainly occurred in the north of the Tagus valley.
   Flash floods caused the majority of fatalities associated with floods,
   while falls and flows were responsible for the highest number of
   fatalities associated with landslides. Males were found to have the
   highest frequency of fatalities. In the case of floods, the majority of
   fatalities were found both outdoors and inside of buildings in rural
   areas while fatalities inside buildings were dominant in landslide
   cases, mostly in rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{In April 2013, a 7.0 Mw earthquake struck in Lushan County, Sichuan
   Province, China, causing serious housing damage. Housing reconstruction
   is a crucial part of disaster recovery, and resident participation has
   been recognized as a key part of reconstruction success. This paper
   examined housing reconstruction resident participation in the
   post-Lushan earthquake period as a multi-stage problem based on
   multi-stakeholder collaborative perspectives, which covered emergency
   shelter, temporary housing and permanent housing stages. Multi-stage
   field research was conducted in the affected areas, and the residents
   were found to be fully involved in the reconstruction with a high medium
   high' distribution across the three stages. Resident participation
   experiences were summarized in terms of previous earthquake education,
   NGO participation and community-based organization functions, and the
   reasons discussed, such as civic awareness and civic rights. Problems
   regarding improper reconstruction and cultural conflicts were also
   examined and valuable suggestions given.}},

Abstract = {{People entering floodwaters by vehicle constitutes a major cause of
   flood fatalities in Australia and globally. Over the 20 years to 2014,
   81 people have died attempting to drive through floodwaters. These
   comprise 43 per cent of all flood fatalities for this period. Despite
   Australian emergency services agencies mounting behavioural change
   campaigns and urging people not to enter floodwater, the behaviour
   persists. This paper draws on fieldwork carried out during flooding in
   the Shoalhaven region of NSW, Australia, in August 2015 to examine the
   effectiveness of the current combination of warnings, education and road
   signage to stop motorists entering floodwater. The fieldwork identified
   that 84 per cent of drivers at a monitored site, notably males and
   four-wheel-drive (4WD) vehicles, dismissed road closure signs and drove
   into floodwater. It is plain that further work is needed to reduce the
   frequency of motorists entering floodwater. This requires the
   development of a holistic approach including education, regulation and
   engineering measures.}},

Abstract = {{The study examined and compared the latent structure of posttraumatic
   growth (PTG) based on three proposed models: 1-factor, 3-factor and
   5-factor models in order to (1) find out the factor structure that has
   the best fit for the Filipino sample; (2) find out the factor structure
   that best represents PTG in the immediate aftermath of a flash flood
   disaster; and (3) examine the generalizability of the best-fitted model
   across gender. A sample of 895 survivor-respondents answered the
   Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) within a month after a deadly
   flash flood. Based on the best-fitted model, a multi-group comparison
   between male and female was conducted to determine gender
   generalizability. Results showed that the 3-factor model comprising of
   Changes in Self/Positive Life Attitudes, Philosophy of Life, and
   Relating to Others fitted best in contrast to the other two models. The
   data also demonstrated the generalizability of the 3-factor model across
   gender, with invariance in factor loadings, item intercepts, factor
   variance and covariance, and factor means.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 25 years, flash floods in the South of France have killed
   almost 250 people. The protection of prone populations is a priority for
   the French government. It is also a goal of the 2007 European flood
   directive. However, no accurate database exists gathering the fatalities
   due to floods in France. Fatalities are supposed to be rare and
   hazardous, mainly due to individual behaviour. A Ph. D. work has
   initiated the building of a database gathering a detailed analysis of
   the circumstances of death and the profiles of the deceased (age,
   gender...). The study area covers the French Mediterranean departments
   prone to flash floods over the period 1988-2015. This presentation
   details the main features of the sample, 244 fatalities collected
   through newspapers completed with field surveys near police services and
   municipalities. The sample is broken down between huge events that
   account for two thirds of the fatalities and ``small{''} events (34 \%
   of the fatalities). Deaths at home account for 35 \% of the total number
   of fatalities, mainly during huge events. 30 \% of fatalities are
   related to vehicles. The last part of the work explains the relations
   between fatalities and prevention and how better knowledge of
   flood-related deaths can help to improve flood prevention. The given
   example shows the relationship between flood forecasting and fatalities.
   Half of the deaths took place in a small watershed (< 150 km(2)). It
   emphasizes the need for the dissemination of a complementary system of
   flash flood forecast based on forecasted rainfall depth and adapted to
   small watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time flood mortality is analysed and compared between a
   Western (Portugal) and an Eastern Mediterranean country (Greece). Flood
   fatalities are examined and compared in terms of frequency, temporal
   evolution, spatial distribution, deadliest flood types, gender of the
   victims, circumstances surrounding fatalities, and individual and
   societal risk.
   A common flood fatalities database was formed for the period 1960-2010
   by merging the DISASTER database for Portugal and the Greek database
   Individual flood cases generated more deaths in Greece than in Portugal
   (excluding an outlier flash flood event in the latter). Despite some
   fluctuations evidence of a gradual decrease in fatality numbers were
   recorded for both countries. Since the 1980's the number of flood cases
   with multiple fatalities has been gradually declining, due to changes in
   qualitative characteristics of mortality. Flood fatalities predominantly
   occur during autumn in Greece and during winter in Portugal.
   In both Greece and Portugal flash floods were responsible for more than
   80\% of the total mortality. The main metropolitan areas of each country
   were found to be hotspots of flood mortality; a trend connected, with
   the higher population density along the coastal areas combined with the
   expansion of urban fabric towards flood-prone areas.
   Gender distribution of fatalities indicates that males are more
   vulnerable in both countries. The circumstances surrounding fatalities
   showed that fatalities occurring inside buildings have been gradually
   reducing in time, while vehicle-related deaths have been rising, showing
   that individuals hold an active role when they voluntarily enter in
   floodwaters during a flood.}},

Abstract = {{Recent flash flood impact studies highlight that road networks are often
   disrupted due to adverse weather and flash flood events. Road users are
   thus particularly exposed to road flooding during their daily mobility.
   Previous exposure studies, however, do not take into consideration
   population mobility. Recent advances in transportation research provide
   an appropriate framework for simulating individual travelactivity
   patterns using an activity-based approach. These activity-based mobility
   models enable the prediction of the sequence of activities performed by
   individuals and locating them with a high spatial-temporal resolution.
   This paper describes the development of the MobRISK microsimulation
   system: a model for assessing the exposure of road users to extreme
   hydrometeorological events. MobRISK aims at providing an accurate
   spatiotemporal exposure assessment by integrating travel-activity
   behaviors and mobility adaptation with respect to weather disruptions.
   The model is applied in a flash-flood-prone area in southern France to
   assess motorists' exposure to the September 2002 flash flood event. The
   results show that risk of flooding mainly occurs in principal road links
   with considerable traffic load. However, a lag time between the timing
   of the road submersion and persons crossing these roads contributes to
   reducing the potential vehicle-related fatal accidents. It is also found
   that sociodemographic variables have a significant effect on individual
   exposure. Thus, the proposed model demonstrates the benefits of
   considering spatiotemporal dynamics of population exposure to flash
   floods and presents an important improvement in exposure assessment
   methods. Such improved characterization of road user exposures can
   present valuable information for flood risk management services.}},

Abstract = {{Floods and landslides are frequent and destructive geo-hydrological
   hazards that cause harm to people every year. We analysed data on 1292
   landslide and 771 flood fatalities that occurred in Italy in the 50-year
   period 1965-2014, to determine the dependence of the fatalities on
   gender and age and the circumstances of death by type of hazard. The
   multinomial probability mass function of the expected fatalities by
   gender and age, as reported by national census data, were estimated and
   compared with the observed landslide and flood fatalities. We identified
   the age categories over or under represented when the observed
   fatalities were respectively higher or lower than the modelled expected
   deaths. We found that in Italy males are more vulnerable to floods and
   landslides for most of the age categories. Apart from children, males
   are over-represented up to the age of 89 for floods and up to 79 for
   landslides, whereas females are under-represented up to the age of 59
   for floods and landslides, and over-represented above 70 for floods and
   between 60 and 79 for landslides. To consider the demographic and
   socio-cultural changes over time, we performed a temporal analysis
   splitting the record into two non-overlapping subsets of 25 year each.
   The analysis demonstrated that the over-representation of males compared
   to the females, both for landslide and flood is statistically
   significant and does not vary in time, indicating a different propensity
   towards the risk taking and a different degree of exposure between males
   and females. Analysis of the data allowed to identify the common
   circumstances of death. Landslides fatalities occurred frequently
   indoor, whereas the majority of the flood fatalities occurred outdoor,
   outlining the different dynamics of the hazards. Floods killed numerous
   people along roads and drivers or passengers travelling in vehicles. We
   expect that the results of this work will be helpful to design
   recommendations for self-protecting actions, and proactive policies that
   can contribute to reduce the human toll of floods and landslides in
   Italy, and elsewhere. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Post-disaster rehabilitation and rebuilding efforts are oftentimes
   spearheaded by government agencies rather hastily, to meet the urgent
   demands of disaster survivors. However in the absence of pre-planning
   for disaster recovery, they may increase community vulnerabilities due
   to a break down in social ties and livelihood needs. There is a growing
   recognition that adhoc top down policies should be replaced with an
   understanding of the preferences and needs of disaster survivors. This
   research is aimed at gauging the intended mitigation strategies that
   survivors from the Himalayan region of North India expressed, following
   the devastating flash flooding in 2013. A semi-structured questionnaire
   was used to interview 316 residents from 17 villages in the State of
   Uttarakhand to measure demographic characteristics, risk perception,
   prior flash flood hazard experience, evacuation experience, damage to
   home, and intended structural (relocate/building back better) and
   non-structural (investing time and effort in emergency planning or
   raising self-awareness and knowledge of threats knowledge) mitigation
   measures. Findings suggest that relocation is not a preferred mitigation
   strategy. Rather, an overwhelming majority of the respondents are
   interested in emergency planning at the household and village levels.
   Investing in revising and updating the plans at all levels of
   government, reviewing the existing forecasting and warning system and
   creating a robust risk communication plan with local input, strictly
   enforcing the provisions of flood Plain Zoning Act, 2012, improving
   hazard awareness programs and creating village level task forces with
   direct linkages to the State disaster Management Agency are some of the
   recommendations made.}},

Abstract = {{Even though flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards in
   the Mediterranean, causing hundreds of deaths and economic losses and
   despite the significant efforts of civil protection authorities of all
   levels to protect human lives and assets, a critical piece of
   information, that is how the general population perceives flood risk, is
   not well known, especially in the Eastern part of the region. This work
   uses structured questionnaires to obtain basic information on how the
   population of one of the largest urban areas in Greece and the Eastern
   Mediterranean understands flood risk, risk mitigation and to what degree
   they take protection measures, they trust relevant institutions and they
   are aware of flood warning and flood protection actions. Then, the study
   examines potential correlations of the findings with respondents'
   demographics.
   Results show that respondents rank floods third in terms of importance
   behind earthquakes and forest fires that are important risk in the
   region, although the vast majority believes the risk is increasing,
   mostly due to anthropogenic factors. Responses illustrate low levels of
   trust in authorities and low levels of knowledge of protection actions
   and awareness regarding floods, as well as low levels of preparedness,
   in terms of taking private mitigation measures. Respondents'
   characteristics such as age, gender, previous flood experience and
   marital status are show statistical correlation with responses, as
   individuals present different perception and levels of knowledge and
   preparedness. Overall, the findings illustrate the need for better
   education and awareness campaigns regarding flood risk and mitigation
   measures.}},

Journal = {{GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Texas ranks first in the U.S in number of fatalities due to natural
   disasters. Based on data culled from the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 1959 to 2016, the number of
   hydrometeorological fatalities in Texas have increased over the 58-year
   study period, but the per capita fatalities have significantly
   decreased. Spatial review found that non-coastal flooding is the
   predominant hydrometeorological disaster in a majority of the Texas
   counties located in Flash Flood Alley and accounts for 43\% of all
   hydrometeorological fatalities in the state. Flooding fatalities occur
   most frequently on Transportation Routes followed by heat fatalities in
   Permanent Residences. Seasonal and monthly stratification identifies
   Spring and Summer as the deadliest seasons, with the month of May
   registering the highest number of total fatalities dominated by flooding
   and tornado fatalities. Demographic trends of hydrometeorological
   disaster fatalities indicated that approximately twice as many male
   fatalities occurred from 1959-2016 than female fatalities, but with
   decreasing gender disparity over time. Adults are the highest fatality
   risk group overall, children are most at risk to die in flooding, and
   the elderly at greatest risk of heat-related death.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, a number of catastrophic hydrometeorological hazards occurred
   in 2017 among which the monsoon floods in South Asia was particularly
   disastrous, killing nearly 1200 people in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
   The wetland region (Haor) of northeastern (NE) Bangladesh was severely
   affected by flash floods early in 2017, affecting nearly 1 million
   households and damaging US \$ 450 million worth of rice crops. This
   study investigates how the NE Bangladesh experienced the 2017 flash
   floods, and to what degree the wetland communities are vulnerable and
   resilience to flash floods. Focus group discussion, key informant
   interviews, and household questionnaire surveys (n=80) were applied in
   the study area of Sunamganj district. Results from statistical analyses
   and regression modelling reveal that poor people are particularly
   vulnerable to floods but they are also more adaptive and thus resilient;
   middle-income households are vulnerable as they are hesitant to take up
   any jobs and accept flood relief; and rich households, despite being
   less adaptive, are able to recover from flood disasters because of
   wealth. This study reveals that resilience also stems from deep
   religious faith in the Haor inhabitants that supports communities to
   move on by accepting that most natural calamities such as flash floods
   are divine tests. This study also finds that women are particularly
   vulnerable and less resilient as they are not normally allowed to work
   outside of their homes and beyond the Haor communities due to cultural
   and religious reasons.}},

Abstract = {{There is a visible paradigm shift in disaster research from hazard and
   vulnerability assessment to developing framework for community
   resilience. Further, there is growing recognization in disaster science
   to develop framework to build resilience of the communities prone to
   natural hazards as highlighted by Sendai Framework for DRR 2015-2030.
   Again, community resilience especially early warning solution for Flash
   Floods, Debris flow and Land-slides in mountainous region of Afghanistan
   has escaped investigation and analysis. The objective of this paper is
   to explore the framework of existing monitoring/early warning systems
   (EWS) for landslides, mudslides and flood in selected villages/districts
   of district Badakhshan province. The framework is based on household
   questionnaire survey among 144respondents selected through purposive
   sampling method. The Climate-related Disaster Community Resilience
   Framework (CDCRF) revealed that there diminishing resilience culture
   among the communities in conflict prone area of Badakhshan Mountain.
   However, despite their exposure to the climate induced extreme events,
   the community has not been able to develop their coping capacity. It has
   also been observer that the primary reason for diminishing resilience
   culture among communities, lack of public accesses to science based
   information, degradation of indigenous knowledge on hazard, gendered
   livelihood transformation and limited adaptive capacity. The paper has
   proposed a new framework of Early Warning Solution for Flash Floods,
   Debris flow and Land-slides, which has wider implication for disaster
   management and emergency planning in the mountains of conflict prone
   area of Afghanistan.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to explore whether a relationship exists between extreme

   districts in Bangladesh that are vulnerable to extreme weather events:
   Sunamganj, which experiences flash flooding, and Brahmanbaria, which
   experiences cyclones and related floods. Survey data was collected from
   120 randomly selected household heads from two villages in these
   districts, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 household
   heads who indicated early marriage was a coping strategy for managing
   effects of weather events. The mixed-methods study finds that early
   marriage of daughters is a coping strategy for managing two negative
   consequences of extreme weather events. First, by minimizing household
   expenses, householders can pay for damage-related expenses. Second,
   unmarried daughters may be subject to sexual violence during a crisis,
   especially in temporary shelters, which would harm both the family's and
   daughter's reputation and prevent future marriage.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to understand community risk perception to environmental
   hazards in a border conflict zone context in high-mountain areas.
   Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools were applied by the social
   science team. The results were validated with a hazard map prepared by a
   separate team comprised of geologists. Turtuk, the northernmost village
   in Ladakh, India located near the line of control with Pakistan was
   undertaken as a case study. Turtuk represents a high mountain indigenous
   rural community which has experienced several catastrophic disasters
   (flash flooding and landslides in 2010, 2014, and 2015) and territorial
   armed conflicts (wars in 1971 and 1999 with Pakistan) in recent times.
   The villagers were able to identify various environmental hazards and
   associated risk zones through participatory timeline diagram, and hazard
   and dream mapping exercises. The PRA maps matched the geological hazard
   map of Turtuk, demonstrating that community people are highly aware of
   surrounding hazards regardless of differences in age, sex, education,
   occupation, and religion. They apply indigenous knowledge to deal with
   the adverse climate and calamities. The technique, of analysing
   community vulnerability in the context of conflict and disasters by
   applying qualitative PRA tools and validating the mapping results, as
   piloted in this study is novel and replicable in any disaster setting.}},

Abstract = {{Devastating floods in southeast Queensland in 2011 were the combination
   of flash flooding in the Lockyer Valley with riverine flooding in the
   Brisbane metropolitan area. While there is considerable information
   about the immediate impact on those affected, there is less
   understanding of the long-term health effects that follow such events.
   This study explored the perceptions of health effects and support
   received by people affected by the 2011 southeast Queensland flood six
   years after the event. A cross-sectional survey of 327 people was
   conducted in areas affected by the floods. The questionnaire sought
   information about the ongoing social, economic, demographic and
   self-declared physical and mental health effects. The data were analysed
   through comparison of those unaffected with those directly affected by
   the floods. Residents whose households were flooded were more likely to
   score their health negatively than non-affected residents and had higher
   reported rates of trauma, injury and mental illness. Twenty-six per cent
   of this group reported that they still experience some adverse health
   effects from the floods. Managing the longterm health implications of a
   flood-affected population is an important public policy task.
   Dissatisfaction with recovery operations and perceived injustices
   associated with insurance and compensation arrangements may aggravate
   health consequences. Early recognition and intervention may assist with
   reducing secondary effects.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are still a significant threat to people, despite of the
   considerable developments in forecasting, management, defensive, and
   rescue works. In the near future, climate and societal changes as both
   urbanization of flood prone areas and individual dangerous behaviors
   could increase flood fatalities. This paper analyzes flood mortality in
   eight countries using a 39-year database (1980-2018) named EUFF
   (EUropean Flood Fatalities), which was built using documentary sources.
   The narratives of fatalities were investigated and standardized in the
   database reporting the details of the events. The entire dataset shows a
   stable trend on flood fatalities, despite the existence of individual
   increasing (Greece, Italy, and South France) and decreasing (Turkey and
   Catalonia) trends. The 2466 fatalities were mainly males, aged between
   30-49 years and the majority of them happened outdoor. Most often people
   were dragged by water/mud when travelling by motor vehicles. Some cases
   of hazardous behaviors, such as fording rivers, were also detected. The
   primary cause of death was drowning, followed by heart attack. This work
   contributes to understand the human-flood interaction that caused
   fatalities. The changes in society's vulnerability highlighted
   throughout this study contribute to manage future risks, to improve
   people protection actions, and to reduce risk behaviors.}},

   was performed to identify the primary factors associated with the
   perception of flash flood risk. Differences between different groups
   under the same impact factor were also compared. The results indicated
   that certain socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents
   (gender, level of education, and type of housing) and prior experience
   correlated with flash flood risk perception. The study also shows
   statistical differences between the groups. In general, males and the
   respondents with a high level of education, homeowners, and people with

Title = {{Potential of Documentary Evidence to Study Fatalities of Hydrological

Abstract = {{This paper presents the potential of documentary evidence for enhancing
   the study of fatalities taking place in the course of hydrological and
   meteorological events (HMEs). Chronicles, ``books of memory{''}, weather
   diaries, newspapers (media), parliamentary proposals, epigraphic
   evidence, systematic meteorological/hydrological observations, and
   professional papers provide a broad base for gathering such information
   in the Czech Republic, especially since 1901. The spatiotemporal
   variability of 269 fatalities in the Czech Republic arising out of 103
   HMEs (flood, flash flood, windstorm, convective storm, lightning, frost,
   snow/glaze-ice calamity, heat, and other events) in the 1981-2018 period
   is presented, with particular attention to closer characterisation of
   fatalities (gender, age, cause of death, place, type of death, and
   behaviour). Examples of three outstanding events with the highest
   numbers of fatalities (severe frosts in the extremely cold winter of
   1928/1929, a flash flood on 9 June 1970, and a rain flood in July 1997)
   are described in detail. Discussion of results includes the problem of
   data uncertainty, factors influencing the numbers of fatalities, and the
   broader context. Since floods are responsible for the highest proportion
   of HME-related deaths, places with fatalities are located mainly around
   rivers and drowning appears as the main cause of death. In the further
   classification of fatalities, males and adults clearly prevail, while
   indirect victims and hazardous behaviour are strongly represented.}},

   flash floods: The case of Mandra 2017 flood in Greece}},

Abstract = {{Floods are among the most frequent phenomena leading to disastrous, long
   term social and economic impacts globally. On November 15, 2017, 24
   people were killed and hundreds were left homeless in the vicinities of
   the towns of Mandra and Nea Peramos in Attica region, Greece, as a
   result of a catastrophic flash flood triggered by extreme rainfall. The
   impact of such events has been the focus of studies for years
   consistently indicating adverse effects ranging from short to long term,
   on post-disaster physical and psychological health. This paper explores
   the initial impact of extreme flash floods on communities in terms of
   psychological and physical health, by means of a self-report
   questionnaire. Findings are investigated in relation to demographic
   variables and vulnerability predictors. Self-reports differed prior and
   after the flash flood, with negative changes in both domains. Results
   indicated significant differences in both physical and physiological
   health by gender, age, marital and occupational status. According to
   Spearman's correlation coefficient, physical and psychological effects
   showed moderately positive correlations for most independent variables.
   Results indicate a need to align prevention, aid and intervention
   strategies in the recovery phase and address issues such as public
   awareness, information provision and post disaster coping strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Floods not only induce vast economic damages but also pose a great
   danger to human life. In Slovenia, floods rank number one on the scale
   of damage magnitude. Different factors external to the hazard of
   flooding influence the gravity and extent of the impacts. A
   comprehensive collection and analysis of the information related to the
   understanding of causative factors of human impacts can substantially
   contribute to the mitigation and the minimisation of fatalities and
   injuries. In this work, historical analysis was performed for flood
   fatalities in the years between 1926 and 2014, with 10 flood events that
   induced 74 casualties considered. A detailed collection and review on
   human impacts was made. Victims in cars have seemed to increase in
   recent years and rural areas tend to be more vulnerable and susceptible
   to having victims of flooding. With regards to gender, the majority of
   victims are male. The focus was on demographic aspects (age and gender)
   of fatalities and analysis of the circumstances of loss of life. Based
   on a description of the activities of victims during flood events and
   repetitive patterns, groups were made based on the type of flood
   fatality. Eight interviews were performed with rescuers and people who
   were affected by floods in order to obtain more extensive information on
   preventative measures, received help, and flood risk perception.}},
