Abstract = {{A flash flood in Fort Collins, Colorado, on 28 July 1997 resulted in 5
   deaths, 62 injuries, and more than \$250 million in property damage.
   Following the 1997 flood, a great many changes were made in the city's
   preparedness infrastructure. On 30 April 1999, a combination of heavy
   rain and melting snow caused a second, less serious flood event. This
   article reports on the changes implemented following the first flood and
   their effectiveness during the second.}},

Abstract = {{The flash flood that occurred on 12-13 November 1999 in meridional
   France is documented. This event caused 35 fatalities and severe damage
   to property as rainfall totals locally exceeded 550 mm in 24 h and 620
   mm in 48 h.
   The main issue of the present study is to discuss how realistically the
   spatial and temporal rainfall distribution of this flash flood event can
   be represented with present state-of-the-art operational and research
   modeling frameworks, The predictability of the present event for
   different forecast ranges is investigated and sensitivity studies are
   conducted in order to discuss the influence of model physics
   (convection, microphysics), atmospheric moisture: analysis and
   Mediterranean sea surface temperature forcing on the quality of the
   results. it is shown that the present event could be reasonably
   predicted on forecast ranges of 2-3 days as it was essentially
   determined by strong moisture advection from the Mediterranean coupled
   with frontal and orographical lifting. However, precipitation scores
   show significant sensitivity to both analysis errors and model physics.

Abstract = {{Vulnerability to natural hazards is spatially variable, and these
   variations are not necessarily in direct proportion to physical risk.
   Other variables come into play, including those related to the nature of
   the hazard, in this case flash floods, and those related to
   socio-economic and land use variables, and all of these might be
   influenced by political decision-making. These data can be incorporated
   as separate data layers in a Geographic Information System, thus
   facilitating analysis of spatial patterns as well as providing the basis
   for determining measures of vulnerability; a number of methods have been
   developed. These methods take into account probability of occurrence,
   indices of the spatial extent, and characteristics of the community at
   risk. Community is sometimes defined by spatial boundaries and other
   times by characteristics such as age or mobility, and the proportion or
   absolute number of people and amount of property at risk. Despite these
   advances, little work has been done to evaluate methods of defining and
   depicting social vulnerability. This is addressed by testing three
   methods in a case study community.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are widely considered as very fast developing catastrophic
   floods resulting from short, intense rainfalls on steep topography.
   Their high-energy and mass transfer potential can be, through
   accelerated erosion mechanisms, the cause or trigger for the occurrence
   of other natural hazards such as shallow mass movement phenomena
   (slides, flows, falls etc.). As with most natural phenomena, flash
   floods need a systemic approach for effectively appreciating their
   dynamic properties including engaged external/internal factors that
   interact, and a rational assessment of their potential impacts. In
   planning a set of structural or non-structural measures for coping with
   flash floods in a particular case, there are some key knowledge points
   that can lead both to optimal selection (under the existing
   constraints), and realization of the mixture of measures. An overview of
   those key points related to the concept of a systemic approach and to
   appropriate engineering geological issues are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A number of mitigation measures are available to mitigate the impact of
   flash floods, ranging from forecasting and warning to land use
   management and relocation of structures out of the flood hazard area.
   Few argue that flash flood mitigation is unnecessary, and the need for
   some mix of measures is generally accepted as preferable to reliance on
   one or another measure. However, mitigation strategies vary in terms of
   cost (both in real dollars and human and other resources),
   acceptability, direct and indirect effects on social, economic, and
   environmental systems, and in their effectiveness. Yet, there is little
   work evaluating mitigation strategies with regard to the criteria listed
   above. The effectiveness of mitigation measures is tested when a flash
   flood occurs, but these are expensive tests that come too tate. A
   strategy to evaluate the range and nature of effects, both beneficial
   and adverse, of flash flood mitigation measures is presented and applied
   to a case study.}},

Abstract = {{In the first week of October 1999, heavy rain events occurred in the
   Eastern slope of the Eastern Sierra Madre of Mexico, with important
   consequences in at least four states of this country. The effects of the
   rainfall were a few thousand mass movements, erosion and loss of
   topsoil, flash floods, and extensive flooding. Damage in three-out of
   the four states accounted for 384 deaths, 66 missing, 212 municipalities
   with damages, 39 rivers that burst their banks, around 198,000 people
   were affected, and 48,000 houses affected to a varying degree. In
   addition, there was a lot of damage to roads and bridges, and serious
   wreckage to agriculture (data provided by the governments of Puebla,
   Veracruz, and Hidalgo). Economic losses were massive. In the state of
   Puebla alone, it is estimated that over 200 million dollars (U.S. \$)
   will be needed for restoring damaged infrastructure (government report,
   Jan. 15, 2000).
   This document shows the most relevant aspects of this disaster that took
   place in the first week of October 1999. It begins by exposing the
   general features of the area, such as physiography and rainfall
   patterns, and describes the meteorological phenomenon that caused such
   widespread damage, by analyzing the rainfall registered during the
   critical days. The paper continues by stressing the geological
   characteristics and other causes that contributed to the mass movements
   in the Sierra Norte of Puebla state. Finally, damages in different
   states are described, and a few conclusions and recommendations are put
   forward.}},

Abstract = {{On many alluvial fans in the drier parts of the world, urban settings
   have replaced natural areas, which in the past had been the domain of
   stream channel wandering, sediment deposition, and attenuation of now
   energy. Due to very long intervals between flood events, little
   attention had been paid to these natural processes, resulting in a
   fallacious sense of security from destructive floods and in widespread
   settlement before the newcomers to the desert were faced with the
   flooding problem. Each stage in the urban development and in the
   establishment of the infrastructure produced an irreversible situation,
   without leaving the necessary expanse required for the passage of floods
   and their sediments. Optimal planning for flood protection became
   increasingly difficult. The town of Eilat was established in 1949 on a
   series of small alluvial fans skirting the mountain front facing the
   Gulf of Eilat. Over the years the town expanded up to the mountain
   front, and rain events hit at varying intervals. The extremely arid
   climate and long floodless years ``encourage{''} the locals to
   ``forget{''} the flood damage shortly after its occurrence, leading to
   an overall neglect in the maintenance of drainageways which have not
   been active for years. The October 1997 rainstorm was the second most
   intense event since 1949. By then the town had doubled in area since the
   previous damaging storm (which occurred in 1982), and the floods could
   enter the town more or less directly, without any natural buffer zone.
   However, despite the extraordinary rainfall amounts of the October 1997
   event, the combination of storm characteristics and urban setting
   created a situation wherein the damage to the town was minimal. The
   urban framework, which includes roads, streets, parking lots,
   playgrounds, parks etc., often without flow continuity between them,
   caused a divergence of the flows, attenuation of their velocity, and the
   capture of floodwaters in small local storages. The result was a fast
   deterioration in peak discharge, a longer flow duration, and little
   appreciable damage. The detailed analysis of the October 1997 rainstorm
   flood shows that a relatively minor shift in the priorities of urban
   design of alluvial fan developments towards a healthy balance between
   flood-conveying and flood-reducing systems may yield long-term benefits
   in the handling of moderate as well as high magnitude floods.}},

Abstract = {{Flood losses in the north central United States are the nation's highest
   since 1980. Losses in Iowa rank first nationally and those in two
   adjacent states rank fourth (Missouri) and sixth (Illinois).
   Explanations were sought for this three-state regional maximum of flood
   losses, including geophysical, societal, and climatological conditions.
   Comparisons of conditions with those of surrounding areas revealed the
   three states had more land exposure to the major flood-prone rivers
   (Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio) than any other state or group of
   states. The region also has a higher population density than surrounding
   areas and contains three of the five largest metropolitan areas of the
   Midwest. Farm land values rank just behind those of the three states to
   the immediate west. Further, the region is the center of the nation's
   complex surface and riverine transportation systems that are highly
   vulnerable to flooding. The assessment of regional hydroclimatic factors
   on enhanced flooding in the three-state region was based on a case study
   of historic floods on two adjacent basins located near the center of the
   region. Historic flood data showed systematic, long-term increases in
   both flood incidence and magnitude. Certain precipitation conditions on
   the basins also showed systematic temporal increases since the 1920s,
   including annual precipitation, number of seven-day heavy rain events,
   and the number of days with precipitation. This climatic shift to more
   multi-day periods of heavy rain appears to be the major reason that
   hydrologic flooding in the three states has increased since the 1920s.
   Analysis of the individual major hydrologic floods revealed five
   different types of precipitation conditions, including snowmelt
   situations that produced major floods. The primary cause of major floods
   was prolonged periods of four- to 13-day durations with intermittent
   moderate to heavy rains, and these events often included heavy,
   15-centimeter rainstorms capable of producing flash floods. Climatic
   data reveal that the three states experience more heavy rain-producing
   synoptic weather conditions, cyclonic activity, and intense rainfalls
   than do most surrounding states. Collectively, these geophysical,
   hydroclimatic, and societal factors combine to cause the high flood
   losses in the nation's central region.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency of extreme stages and floods along rivers like Rhine and
   Danube seems to have increased after the second World War. The question,
   as to whether this increased frequency is due to climate changes or
   human impacts, has been raised repeatedly. We hypothesize that the
   increased frequency is related to the intensification of German
   agriculture. For the pre-sent study, we analyzed developments in German
   agronomy after World War II, especially in soil tillage. We also
   analyzed flood stages of the river Rhine at Cologne, both for prewar and
   postwar times. The analysis revealed that the relation between peak
   discharge of a flood wave on one side, and catchment rainfall on the
   other, has changed after the war. Our calculations show, for example,
   that an extreme rainfall amount of 200 mm in the Rhine catchment within
   one month results in a mean peak discharge at Cologne that presently is
   1544 m(3) s(-1) higher than before the war. Simultaneously, our analysis
   indicates that conventional soil tillage after World War II was
   intensified. During heavy or long lasting rainstorms, this intensified
   conventional tillage seems to promote surface runoff. We assume that
   postwar intensified tillage has led to a physical soil degradation that
   at least partly explains the increased frequency of extreme stages and
   floods along Germany's rivers. To reduce the threat of flash floods, it
   seems recommendable to extend conservation tillage subsidies.}},

Abstract = {{Southeast Spain has a semiarid climate with highly variable rainfall
   from year to year. Global warming scenarios predict a decrease in
   rainfall in future and land-use changes may also alter run-off regimes.
   Water deficit has meant that various practices of floodwater farming
   have traditionally operated in valley floors. However, flash floods in
   the valley floors can also be dangerous and damaging. Many of the
   boqueras and other floodwater irrigation systems have been abandoned.
   The effects on the hydrological regime of the channel are calculated.
   These structures and water management practices could have an effect on
   the magnitude of low-moderate peak discharges, but are insignificant in
   high flows. Modem channel and flood management employs check dams, but
   these are frequently destroyed in moderate-high flows. Alternative
   strategies of channel management need to be sought and the use or
   vegetation cover to dissipate flood peaks and to reduce erosion may
   offer one possibility. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A GIS-based assessment of landslide risk to the Cairns community has
   been carried out to provide information to the Cairns City Council for
   planning and emergency management purposes. Magnitude recurrence
   relations were tentatively established for landslides on the hill
   slopes; and large debris flows extending out from the gully systems on
   to the plains. From the recurrence relations, landslide hazard was
   estimated. The elements at risk were ascertained by interrogating the
   GIS, and their vulnerabilities were assessed, Specific risk and total
   risk maps were produced. Landslide risk may increase as development
   extends further into the hill slopes, Large debris flows could impact on
   subdivisions at the base of the slopes. Blockage by landslides of roads
   and railways can cause isolation of the community. Flash flooding in
   Freshwater Creek, or debris flows, have the potential to disrupt the
   Cairns water supply by blocking the intake or destroying sections of the
   pipeline.}},

Abstract = {{Natural geological hazards such as flash floods, landslides, debris
   flows and mudflows have caused, and will continue to cause, many
   problems in Malawi. Landslide risks are primarily a geological problem
   and it is Quaternary geology that concerns our environment most. It is a
   typical geological task to reconstruct the old events using geological,
   geomorphological and dating methods and based on these results, predict
   possible future disasters. Our studies of old and recent debris flow
   events in Southern Malawi have found out that these phenomena are mainly
   triggered by tropical cyclones that bring heavy rainfalls. They occur in
   mountain slopes with certain slope instability, soil cover and
   discontinuity patterns of the underlying rocks. Human impacts on the
   environment such as large scale earthworks projects and replacement of
   natural forests by non endemic tree species have also played an
   important role in a rising risk of flash floods and debris flows, It is
   recommended that the most sustainable method of mitigation against these
   hazards is to incorporate the geological hazard zoning maps into town
   and regional planning schemes. Where this may not be possible, measures
   that can reduce or minimise the hazard impact should be adopted.
   Zomba Mountain is made of a Mesozoic syenite pluton that intruded
   Precambrian high-grade metamorphic gneisses and granulites. Weathering
   erosion and uplift have left the syenite standing at an elevation of
   2000 meters while the surrounding area is between 700 and 1000 meters
   above sea level. Zomba town is located at the foot of the mountain.
   Steep slopes with up to 50degrees, the highly jointed syenite, and the
   thick lateritic soil covers are the main factors likely to influence
   rock, instability, Debris flows triggered by heavy rainfall have
   affected Zomba since memorial times. People of Zomba and the authorities
   are well aware of past landslides and the continued risk. As a result
   from our investigations the detailed risk zoning of Zomba contributes to
   the disaster preparedness plan of the town.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of high and low resolution polar and geostationary orbital
   Earth Resource Satellites have been shown to be an excellent tool for
   providing hydrological information. Operational geostationary
   meteorological satellites have the capability to provide precipitation
   estimates and soil wetness indices at the global scale, while polar
   orbital satellites can provide the quantification of catchment physical
   characteristics, such as topography and land use, and catchment
   variables such as soil moisture and snow cover. There have been many
   demonstrations of the operational use of these satellites for detailed
   monitoring and mapping of floods and post-flood damage assessment.
   This paper addresses the use of Earth Observation satellites for flood
   managers, flash flood analysis and prediction, and the user community. A
   remote sensing management cycle is presented that involves: (1)
   prevention where history, corporate memory, and climatology are
   important; (2) mitigation that insulates people or infrastructure from
   hazards; (3) pre-flood which is the preparation and forecast stage where
   remote sensing is essential; (4) response (during the flood) where
   ``actions to be taken is of key importance and weather NOWCASTS (0 - 3
   hour prediction of precipitation) using remote sensing is extremely
   useful; and (5) recovery (post flood) which is the post-mortern stage
   where damage assessment, procedures, and numerical weather prediction
   and hydrological models are validated.
   Gaps in our remote sensing capabilities, future improvements and
   requirements, and the requirement for demonstration projects to
   illustrate and educate the end-user community on the capabilities of
   satellite remotely sensed data to provide information during all of the
   phases of the disaster cycle are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, flood is the number one cause of losses from natural events.
   Flood insurance has attracted more and more attention in recent years,
   not only in the fields of science and politics but also within the
   insurance industry itself. Although the list of great natural disasters
   is headed by storms, and despite the relatively low density of insurance
   against flooding, the large number of local flood events constitutes a
   large interest for the insurance industry. Flooding comes in various
   forms, ranging from storm surges to flash floods and from sometimes
   country-wide river floods to glacial lake outburst and dam break floods.
   These different forms of flooding are important when it comes to
   insurance concepts, for which adverse selection plays an important role.
   Various concepts for the field of flood insurance have been investigated
   and discussed in different countries. In Germany, the insurance
   industry, in a combined effort, has launched a project to identify zones
   of similar risk resulting from river floods for the whole country. The
   identification of possible clients and the calculation of premiums are
   two uses of the developed model, as well as the assessment of probable
   maximum losses. Only river floods are considered in the model, flash
   floods and storm surges are excluded; flood control measures are not
   taken into account either.}},

Abstract = {{A GIS-based regional reconnaissance-level assessment of landslide risk
   to the Cairns community has been carried out to provide information to
   the Cairns City Council for planning and emergency management purposes.
   Magnitude recurrence relations were tentatively established for the two
   main slope processes: landslides on the hill slopes; and large debris
   flows extending out from the gully systems on to the plains. From the
   recurrence relations, landslide hazard (H) was estimated as the annual
   probability of a point being impacted by a landslide. The nature, number
   (E) and geographic distribution of the elements at risk were obtained by
   interrogating the GIS, and their vulnerabilities (V) to destruction by
   the two main landslide slope processes were assessed. From this
   information, specific risk (= H x V) and total risk (= H x V x E) maps
   were produced.
   Although total landslide risk is relatively low at present, it will
   increase as development extends further into the hill slopes, unless
   adequate mitigation measures are taken. Large debris flows, while
   considerably less frequent than landslides on cut slopes, could impact
   on subdivisions at the base of the slopes. Blockage by landslides of
   roads and railways providing access to Cairns can cause isolation of the
   community. Flash flooding in Freshwater Creek, or debris flows, have the
   potential to disrupt the Cairns water supply by blocking the intake or
   destroying sections of the pipeline.}},

Abstract = {{The disastrous flood on the Tepla River, which afflicted the spa town of
   Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad) in 1582 originated from thunderstorms with
   cloudburst. The flushing water damaged dams of many local fish ponds in
   the upper part of the river basin. All sites situated near the river
   banks were flooded. Situated on the lower reach of the Tepla R. before
   its opening from the right into the Oh e (Eger) R., the spa Carlsbad was
   hit by the flood wave after 17.00 and was largely devastated. The high
   water took away about 36 houses and tens of people lost their lives. The
   disaster was depicted by numerous occasional prints in German language,.
   A discourse on the flood was also written in Latin. A detailed Czech
   description is contained in the period chronicle by the Prague humanist
   Marek Bydzovsky of Florentine. This natural disaster is apparently the
   oldest flash flood recorded in detail from Czech territory.}},

Abstract = {{The catastrophic flooding on the 18th of October, 1973, in the dry
   stream (rambla) of Albu (n) over tilde ol caused the loss of 46 lives,
   the destruction of 91 houses and serious damages to 141. A layer of mud
   (2 to 3 metres thick) covered the streets of La Rabita (the village most
   damaged). The roads and the bridges of comunication between the town and
   the rest of the province were destroyed along with 250 hectares of
   cultivated land. The damages were estimated at 300 millions of pesetas.
   A heavy rainstorm (600 mm) produced the rapid development of a high
   density flow in the dry stream, with an elevated volume of sediments
   (113 of the discharge), that was the responsible factor of the high
   discharge reachedduring the flood (2580 m(3)/s).
   The object of this study is not only the identification of the episode
   and the analysis of the disaster's social impact, but also to analyse
   the different techniques to study the flooding in this type of fluvial
   system. The historic reconstruction of the event includes an analysis of
   the social impact and restoration works of the affected area. In
   addition the hydrologic analyses of the flooding that was based on the
   study of the greatest floods in small basins has been carried out.
   Finally, a morphodynamic and sedimentologic reconstruction was
   undertaken. The sedimentological study of deposits corresponding to the
   flash flood shows that the dynamic nature of these alluvial channels has
   important implications for floodplain management policy. The potencial
   for dramatic changes in geomorphic and hydrologic characteristics of
   alluvial channels must be considered in establishing procedures for
   flood hazard evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the circumstances in which a `shelter-in-place'
   strategy may be a viable alternative to evacuation during flash floods.
   While evacuation remains the dominant strategy for a range of hazards, a
   review of the literature suggests growing awareness of the dangers
   associated with late evacuations and some limited consideration of
   shelter-in-place options. This study examines the feasibility of a
   shelter-in-place strategy for flash floods in Australia through: a
   review of literatures on evacuation, `sheltering-in-place' and flood
   fatalities; an analysis of Australian flash flood fatalities and
   injuries; and interviews with flood and emergency managers. The results
   demonstrate that the majority of flash flood fatalities (75.7 per cent)
   have occurred outside when people have entered flood waters in a vehicle
   or on foot for a range of reasons, including to continue their intended
   travel, engage in recreational pursuits, continue their work, and
   evacuate or carry out a rescue. Interviews with emergency managers
   confirm that while shelter-in-place may not be the preferred option, the
   strategy may need to be implemented for flash floods when, due to the
   limited warning times, evacuation is not possible.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood in the cities led to high levels of water in the streets and
   roads, causing many problems such as bridge collapse, building damage
   and traffic problems. It is impossible to avoid risks of floods or
   prevent their occurrence, however it is plausible to work on the
   reduction of their effects and to reduce the losses which they may
   cause. Flash flood mapping to identify sites in high risk flood zones is
   one of the powerful tools for this purpose. Mapping flash flood will be
   beneficial to urban and infrastructure planners, risk managers and
   disaster response or emergency services during extreme and intense
   rainfall events. The objective of this paper is to generate flash flood
   map for Najran city, Saudi Arabia, using satellite images and GIS tools.
   To do so, we use SPOT and SRTM DEMs data for which accuracy assessment
   is achieved by using check points, obtained by GPS observations.
   Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) is used to determine relative
   impact weight of flood causative factors to get a composite flood hazard
   index (FHI). The causative factors in this study are runoff, soil type,
   surface slope, surface roughness, drainage density, distance to main
   channel and land use. All used data are finally integrated in an ArcMap
   to prepare a final flood hazard map for study area. The areas in high
   risk flood zones are obtained by overlaying the flood hazard index map
   with the zone boundaries layer. The affected population number and land
   area are determined and compared. (C) 2015 Authority for Remote Sensing

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the
   perception of stakeholders, i. e. disaster victims, volunteers and
   managers, who were involved in relief activities, toward the enablers in
   humanitarian supply chain management (HSCM) with special emphasis on
   heart wrenching and deadliest disaster, that occurred in the Uttarakhand
   (a northern state in India) on June 14, 2013.
   Design/methodology/approach - A detailed case study of the recently
   disaster, that occurred in the Uttarakhand has been carried out to
   investigate the enablers associated with the HSCM and the data were
   collected from published literature and newspaper articles,
   semi-structured interviews with academic experts and practitioners,
   hypothesis were formulated and tested using analysis of variance.
   Findings - The findings of the study indicate that, there is no
   significant difference in the perception of disaster victims, volunteers
   and managers toward the enablers in HSCM in India. There is a strong
   need for more effective and efficient monitoring of over-exploitation of
   the mountainous regions, Geographic Information Systems mapping of the
   state and a separate disaster communication network.
   Research limitations/implications - The scope of study is limited to
   flash floods that occurred in the Uttarakhand. Extending the research on
   other types of disaster could be considered as the scope for further
   research.
   Practical implications - The paper investigates some of the enablers of
   HSCM and discusses some of the emerging issues and lessons learned from
   the disaster that occurred in the Uttarakhand, in managing future
   disasters in India and the other world.
   Originality/value - This paper presents the first attempt in India with
   its combination of field-based qualitative research and survey analysis
   to investigate the enablers of HSCM in India.}},

Abstract = {{Urban hydrology has developed together with the urbanization, and has
   focused on the hydraulic design of sewer systems. Intense rain events,
   for instance Nimes in 1988, have shown the major bed of rainwater sewer
   network exists and is formed by the street network. Expressions such as
   ``urban floods{''} or ``floods of urban runoff{''} illustrate this
   finding which has been followed by reflections addressing the problem of
   intense rain events on urbanized areas. Can we consider urban floods as
   flash floods? The response is not straightforward even if urban
   catchments display features: small surface areas, short response times
   making them sensitive to intense rain events of small duration. This
   paper attempts to contribute to the reflections on this subject through
   two case studies. Seine-Saint-Denis and Marseille.}},

Abstract = {{Severe damages due to flash flooding within a park and center of
   downtown Ashland directly threatened the economic viability of the town,
   which is heavily dependent on tourism. It also impacted the quality of
   life for residents drawn to the considerable amenities offered by this
   small community. Park trails are heavily used by residents as well as
   visitors, and the Calle Guanajuato, where the creek is bordered by
   sidewalk cafes, is a special magnet for tourists. Although traditional
   environmental concerns were of great importance in the ``restoration{''}
   of flood-damaged Ashland Creek, it was the recreational value of the
   creek and its importance to the area's economy that was of paramount
   importance. This fact is reflected in the unique approaches to urban
   creek corridor rehabilitation discussed here. This case study
   demonstrates some of the problems as well as design opportunities which
   arise when ``conventional{''} thinking on stream restoration, which has
   generally been focused on fish in the Pacific Northwest, must contend
   with both the legacy effects of past impacts and the premium that many
   cities and towns now place on watercourses as recreational and visual
   assets for the community.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal areas of Bangladesh frequently experience tropical cyclones and
   associated tidal bore. In order to prevent cyclonic or storm-surge
   flooding and to increase crop production by preventing intrusion of
   saline ocean water, many coastal embankment projects were initiated in
   the 1960s by the Bangladesh government. After construction of these
   embankments, particularly their reconstruction in 1991 has increased the
   frequency of flash floods in coastal areas. The objective of this study
   is to examine to what extent the reconstruction of embankment is
   responsible for the increased severity of flash flooding at the Chokoria
   thana of the Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh. Using hydrological data
   and perception of the respondents on the increased flooding through the
   rapid rural appraisal (RRA) method, it was found that severity of the
   flood increased after the reconstruction of embankments in 1991. Other
   causes of increased flooding is also explored. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{NALCO - the largest exporter of aluminium in India has a power plant of
   720 MW capacity in Nandira watershed in Angul district of Orissa. The
   power plant utilises local coal to generate thermal power and disposes
   of large amount of ash which accumulates in slurry form at nearby two
   ash ponds. These ash ponds were breached on 31 December 2000, causing
   ash accumulation for entire regime of the Nandira river. An attempt has
   been made towards preparation of recovery and rehabilitation plan for
   NALCO using temporal Remote Sensing data and GIS. Indian remote sensing
   satellite data for pre-breach condition 12 December 2000, during breach
   event 31 December 2000 and post-breach condition 4 and 6 January 2001
   has been digitally analysed for Nandira watershed. The satellite data of
   coarse spatial resolution provides the absence and presence of fresh
   sediment deposition along Nandira watershed and Brahmani river
   pertaining to pre-breach and post-breach conditions respectively on
   regional scales. The temporal comparison of fine resolution has clearly
   highlighted the aerial extent of damage caused by the disaster for
   entire watershed on local scales. The GIS has helped in demarcation of
   freshly accumulated ash at interval of 500 m along the river length as
   well as in delineation of maximum ash accumulation across the liver
   width. The study has clearly demonstrated the use of temporal Remote
   Sensing data in conjunction with GIS for disaster management in terms of
   recovery and rehabilitation plan preparation of the Nandira watershed.}},

Pages = {{239-258}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Landslides in the city of La Paz, Bolivia are complex in space and time.
   Their distribution within the city is differentiated by geographical
   variations in slope gradient, the nature of overlying surface deposits,
   and drainage density patterns. When mapped, the distribution of the most
   landslide-prone locations in the city coincides with the most mobile
   surface deposits on the higher and steeper slopes of the city. The
   timing of landslides is triggered when slope materials become saturated
   with moisture by rainfall, stream water, water seepage from high
   surrounding water tables, and from domestic sources. Landslide
   frequencies over the last 40 years show the role of inter-annual
   variations in summer rainfalls, especially the late summer period
   (Jan-Mar), and rising water tables connected to Lake Titicaca.
   Associations with ENSO events, both warm (El Nino) and cold (La Nina),
   prove negative, pointing to the importance of moisture sources from the
   north, south and east (Amazon) but not from the west (Pacific). The most
   vulnerable group exposed to the landslide hazard comprise the
   inhabitants of the self-built informal housing areas who occupy the more
   elevated steeper slopes of the northern part of the city. But societal
   vulnerability to earth movement in the city is widespread and
   interconnected. Higher income groups in the southern part of the city
   are affected by slower, if less dramatic, forms of land failure, and
   rich housing in downstream areas of the city are impacted by flash
   flooding encouraged by deforestation on the northern hill slopes where
   the poor live. Two case studies highlight the vulnerability and plight
   of the inhabitants of the self-built settlements in the aftermath of a
   major landslide, and a brief discussion of hazard mitigation and the
   importance of building hazard resilient communities concludes the paper.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of calamitous meteoric events represents a current
   problem of the Salento peninsula (Southern Italy). In fact, flash
   floods, generated by very intense rainfall, occur not only in autumn and
   winter, but at the end of summer as well. These calamities are amplified
   by peculiar geological and geomorphological characteristics of Salento
   and by the pollution of sinkholes. Floodings affect often large areas,
   especially in the impermeable lowering zones. These events cause
   warnings and emergency states, involving people as well as
   socio-economic goods.
   A methodical investigation based on the historic flood records and an
   analysis of the geoenvironmental factors have been performed, using a
   Geographic Information System (GIS) methodology for database processing
   in order to identify the distribution of areas with different risk
   degrees. The data, referring to events that occurred from 1968 to 2004,
   have been collected in a database, the so-called IPHAS (Salento Alluvial
   PHenomena Inventory), extracted in an easily consultable table. The
   final goal is the development of a risk map where the areas that are
   affected by floodings are included between small ridges, the so-called
   ``Serre{''}. More than 50\% of the Salento peninsula shows high or very
   high risk values. The numerous maps that were utilized and gencrated
   represent an important basis in order to quantify the flood risk,
   according to the model using historic records.}},

Abstract = {{Alluvial fans create a special type of flash flood threat, especially in
   and and semi-arid areas where the fans support urban development. Most
   of the cities in Iran have developed in such environments, and are
   facing flash and urban floods because of the rapid growth of the cities,
   and the deficiency of urban planning in the last four decades. The
   present study aims at analyzing the urbanization effect on natural
   drainage patterns and their immediate result, namely the increase of
   vulnerability of the metropolitan city of Mashhad. Mashhad, as the
   second religious metropolis of the world, and second metropolis of Iran
   has an annual 12 million pilgrims, and 3 million population. The results
   of this study indicate that the rapid growth of the city from 1966 to
   2002 has had excessive destructive effects on the catchments area, and
   has caused the decrease of impervious surfaces, and the increase peak
   discharge of the urban floods.}},

Abstract = {{The number of people inhabiting our globe is constantly increasing. At
   the same time the amount of people living in the cities is growing very
   fast. This way in many countries the population of the cities amounts to
   80\% of the total country's population. Floods in urban areas are more
   and more frequent. These floods cause considerable economic and social
   losses mainly because of developed and expensive city infrastructure.
   This infrastructure goes now very often underground, which is very flood
   prone in case of inundation of the city. In urban areas measures and
   solutions for flood mitigation are primarily of engineering character.
   However, very often it is difficult to find advantageous technical
   solutions, because existing city infrastructure restricts the
   introduction of appropriate new constructions. Another important factor
   in urban areas is considerable speed of floods, which requires earlier,
   good planning of solutions in case of inundation.
   Flash flood in Gdansk in 2001 can be considered as an example of local
   case. Gdansk the Polish old city situated at the mouth of the Vistula
   River (1047 kin long) is most flood prone agglomeration in Poland. There
   are three possible flood directions. First is from the moraine hills, in
   case of intensive precipitation, second direction is from the Gulf of
   Gdansk in case of storm surges and the third is from the main Vistula
   channel in case of very high discharge.
   The paper presents the description of floods in the area of Gdansk
   during past centuries. They were caused mainly by ice jams which formed
   along final section of Vistula River of very complicated layout. In July
   2001 a severe flash flood, coming from the moraine hills invaded Gdansk
   causing considerable economic and social losses. It was caused by very
   high and intensive rainfall. One of the main objects in this flood was
   an artificial Radunia Channel, constructed in the XI V century. The main
   aim of this Channel was the supply of water to the city of Gdansk. In
   the paper the analysis of this flood is presented. Detailed measurements
   of all water courses, hydrological and hydraulic analysis were carried
   out. I D unsteady flow model of the Gdansk Water Node was developed.
   Calculations were carried out to find the best technical solutions to
   mitigate consequences of a similar flood in the future. It was proposed
   to construct 18 small retention reservoirs in the catchment of Radunia
   Channel, 4 additional control discharge structures from Radunia Channel
   and in addition 2 flood polders. The network of measuring stations was
   also proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To estimate the occurrence and to assess the determinants of
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in flood victims.
   Method: We carried out a retrospective study to examine the occurrence
   and the determinants of PTSD in victims of flood in 1998 and 1999 in
   Hunan, China. We used multistage sampling to select the subjects from
   the flood areas, and we ascertained PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria.
   Data were collected in face-to-face interviews carried out by
   experienced research assistants using a preconstructed questionnaire. We
   used a multiple logistic regression model to analyze the data.
   Results: A total of 33 340 subjects (86.0\% of the selected subjects,
   aged 7 years or over) in the study villages were interviewed. Among
   them, 2875 (8.6\%) had symptoms that met the diagnostic criteria for
   PTSD. Significant risk factors for PTSD included female sex (odds ratio
   {[}OR] 1.12; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.04 to 1.21), older age
   (age 18 to 59 years OR 2.28; 95\%CI, 2.02 to 2.57, and age >= 60 years
   OR 2.42; 95\%CI, 2.05 to 2.85), flood type (collapsed embankment OR
   1.84; 95\%CI, 1.64 to 2.05, and flash flood OR 3.12; 95\%CI, 2.76 to
   3.52), and flood severity (intermediate OR 4.05; 95\%CI, 3.55 to 4.62,
   and severe OR 2.98; 95\%CI, 2.60 to 3.41).
   Conclusions: PTSD is a common mental disorder in flood victims, which
   implies the need for improved health services, especially mental health
   services, for this population.}},

Abstract = {{On Friday 16 October 1954, Hurricane Hazel generated flash floods in the
   watersheds surrounding Toronto. Flooding destroyed bridges, engulfed
   trailer parks and residential areas, and swept automobiles, trailers,
   cottages and homes into the strong current. In this essay, the authors
   explore the ways that the federal and provincial governments interacted
   with voluntary organizations and local governments to deal with the
   immediate crisis produced by Hazel's floods, and how they negotiated the
   lengthy process of restoration. The responses of those governments tell
   us much about the social and environmental assumptions as well as the
   political capacity of Canadian society in the mid-1950s. The federal and
   provincial governments immediately promised action, but then reluctantly
   became involved in reconstruction, leaving as much responsibility as
   possible to voluntary organizations and local governments. A tropical
   storm travelling through the province of Ontario was a relatively rare
   event, yet ultimately government officials did not respond to the Hazel
   disaster as a random, chance event. Instead, the conservation movement
   and local authorities pressured governments to see the hurricane
   flooding not as a natural disaster, but as a tragedy, which human
   decisions had helped precipitate, and which, in the future, human
   decisions might alleviate.}},

   stormwater of intense rainfall associated with thunderstorms. Flash
   flooding occurs in many urban areas with relatively flat terrain and can
   result in severe property damage as well as the loss of lives. In this
   paper, an integrated one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D)
   hydraulic simulation model has been established to simulate stormwater
   flooding processes in urban areas. With rainfall input, the model
   simulates 2-D overland flow and 1-D flow in underground stormwater pipes
   and drainage channels. Drainage channels are treated as special flow
   paths and arranged along one or more sides of a 2-D computational grid.
   By using irregular computation grids, the model simulates unsteady
   flooding and drying processes over urban areas with complex drainage
   systems. The model results can provide spatial flood risk information
   (e.g., water depth, inundation time and flow velocity during flooding).
   The model was applied to the City of Beaumont, Texas, and validated with
   the recorded rainfall and runoff data from Tropical Storm Allison with
   good agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy convective rainfall often results in flooding in urban regions.
   The rainfall runoff process, however, is highly complex, nonlinear, and
   temporally and spatially varying because of the variability of the
   terrain and climate attributes. An intelligent traffic system covering
   the emergency response capacity in response to flooding impacts in
   low-lying area of urban region is highly desirable to drivers and
   passengers nowadays. The proposed motes-based sensor network has three
   major modules, which are water level monitoring module, network video
   record module, and data processing module. The water level monitoring
   module sensors water level information and transmits it to a server
   computer via motes-based wireless network. The network video record
   module takes and sends video in real-time to the server too. The data
   processing module linking existing flooding level with NOAA NEXRAD
   rainfall prediction data enables us to publish online raw data, predict
   inundation zone, and disseminate video information through different
   media. Such integration would greatly enhance the disaster management
   capacity in hurricane events.}},

Title = {{Measures and solutions for flood management. A local case: Flash flood
   2001 in Gdansk, Poland}},

Abstract = {{The population of the globe is constantly growing. At the same time the
   number of people living in cities is exploding. Today, in many countries
   the population of the cities amounts to 80\% of the total country's
   population. Floods in urban areas occur more and more frequently; they
   cause considerable economic and social losses mainly because of
   developed and expensive city infrastructure. Today, infrastructure goes
   underground, which is very flood prone in case of inundation. In urban
   areas measures and solutions for flood mitigation primarily have an
   engineering character. However, it is quite often difficult to find
   advantageous technical solutions, because existing city infrastructure
   restricts the introduction of appropriate new constructions. Another
   important factor in urban areas is the considerable propagation speed of
   floods, which requires advanced, good planning of solutions in the case
   of a (potential) inundation.
   The flash flood in Gdansk in 2001 can be considered as an example of an
   interesting local case with lessons for other cities with medieval
   downtown areas. Gdansk, the historic Polish city, is situated at the
   mouth of the Vistula River (1047 km long), and is the most flood-prone
   agglomeration in Poland. Here, floods can come from three directions.
   The first is down from the moraine hills during severe precipitation;
   the second direction is from the Gulf of Gdansk during storm surges; the
   third is from the main Vistula channel when very high discharges come
   down the river.
   This paper presents a description of (severe) floods in the Gdansk area
   over the past centuries. They were caused mainly by ice jams, which were
   formed along the final section of the Vistula River, which has a rather
   complicated layout. In July 2001 a severe flash flood, coming down from
   the moraine hills, invaded Gdansk causing considerable economic and
   social losses. A long and intensive rainfall caused it. One of the
   crucial objects during this flood was the artificial Radunia Channel,
   constructed in the 14th century. The main aim of this channel was the
   supply of fresh water to the city of Gdansk. In this paper an analysis
   of this flood is presented.. Detailed measurements of all watercourses
   in the Gdansk area, together with hydrological and hydraulic studies,
   have been carried out. A 1D unsteady flow model of the Gdansk Water Node
   was developed. Calculations were carried out to find the best technical
   solutions to mitigate consequences of a similar flood in the future. It
   was proposed to construct 18 small retention reservoirs in the catchment
   of Radunia Channel, 4 additional control discharge structures from
   Radunia Channel and in addition 2 flood retention polders. A network of
   measuring stations was also proposed. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This paper provides a framework for analyzing flood fatalities and
   injuries, and it describes the derivation of a generalized flood risk
   (i.e., flood consequences and their probabilities) function by
   introducing an integrated index (the number of residential buildings
   affected by a flood) that represents the major change in the power
   relation among the flood intensity, regional vulnerability, and
   resilience. Both the probabilities and the numbers of fatalities and
   injuries clearly increase significantly after the flood severity (in
   terms of the number of inundated buildings) passes a branch point. Below
   the branch point, it is still possible for fatalities and injuries to
   occur because of the variability in the data and the uncertainty in the
   predicted fatality values. The empirical models of fatalities and
   injuries due to floods in Japan suggested the usefulness in predicting
   fatalities and injuries and evaluating the efficacy of the warning or
   other emergency response measures.}},

Abstract = {{Bhutan has taken the initiative in developing a comprehensive guideline
   on disaster risk preparedness and management in response to several
   minor disasters, namely earthquakes and flash floods in the country
   during the last couple of years. It is now widely accepted that the
   psychological symptoms of trauma resulting from devastation to lives and
   livelihood of affected people remain much longer and sometimes
   throughout their entire life span unless taken care of. Therefore, it is
   important to include psychosocial components of mental health protection
   and treatment of the affected persons in disaster risk preparedness and
   management to make it a comprehensive package. A four-tier system of
   mental health intervention and counselling has been proposed in line
   with the existing healthcare system and resources available in the
   country to make it sustainable. At the core of this programme is the
   mobilizing and training of volunteers from the community on psychosocial
   intervention, counselling and rehabilitation, backed up by three layers
   of trained health workers and mental health professionals.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods are one of the most dangerous weather-related natural
   disasters in the world. These events develop less than six hours after a
   rainfall event and create hazardous situations for people and extensive
   damage to property. It is critical for flash flood conditions to be
   warned of in a timely manner to minimize impacts. There is currently a
   knowledge gap between flood experts and the general public about the
   level of perceived risk that the latter has toward the powerful flood
   waters and how events should be warned of, which affects the
   communication capabilities and efficiency of the warning process. Prior
   research has addressed risk perception of natural disasters, but there
   is little emphasis on flash floods within flood-prone regions of the
   United States. This research utilizes an online survey of 300
   respondents to determine the current state of flash flood awareness and
   preparation in southwest Virginia. Analysis of trends involved the use
   of chi-squared tests (chi(2)) and simple frequency and percentage
   calculations. Results reveal that a knowledge base of flash floods does
   exist, but is not advanced enough for proper awareness. Young adults
   have a lower understanding and are not as concerned about flood impacts.
   Increased exposure and perceived risk play a key role in shaping the way
   a person approaches flash floods. People do monitor flood events, but
   they are unaware of essential guidance and communication mechanisms.
   Finally, results suggest that the current method of warning about flash
   floods is not provided at an appropriate level of detail for effective
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{Perceptions of flash floods and landslides were analyzed in four
   communities of the Bavarian Alps using the mental model approach.
   Thirty-eight qualitative interviews, two telephone surveys with 600
   respondents, and two onsite interviews (74/95 respondents) were
   conducted. Mental models concerning flash floods are much better
   developed than those for landslides because the key physical processes
   for flash floods are easier for the general public to recognize and
   understand. Mental models are influenced by the local conditions. People
   who have a better knowledge about the hazards are those who use many
   different sources to inform themselves, express fear about natural
   hazards, or have previous experience with hazards. Conclusions for how
   to improve information for the general public are discussed.}},

   issues associated with improving operational forecast and management of

   These issues are physical and social science issues as well as
   institutional issues pertaining to the coordination of researchers,
   forecasters and end-users toward improving effectiveness of the
   hydrologic enterprise of flood damage mitigation and death toll
   reduction. A case study of integrated end-to-end climate-hydrology-water
   resources management in an operational environment, and another of flash
   flood prediction over large regions with very high resolution serve to
   highlight these issues. Transition from deterministic to probabilistic
   forecasting is advanced as necessary for improving forecast generation
   and use. In addition, the concept of demonstration testbeds with
   participation of researchers, forecasters and end-users is advanced as a
   viable solution to the development of end-to-end forecast-decision
   systems for mitigating flood damage and reducing disaster death tolls.}},

Abstract = {{This work deals with the elaboration of flood hazard maps. These maps
   reflect the areas prone to floods based on the effects of Hurricane
   Mitch in the Municipality of Jucuaran of El Salvador. Stream channels
   located in the coastal range in the SE of El Salvador flow into the
   Pacific Ocean and generate alluvial fans. Communities often inhabit
   these fans can be affected by floods. The geomorphology of these stream
   basins is associated with small areas, steep slopes, well developed
   regolite and extensive deforestation. These features play a key role in
   the generation of flash-floods. This zone lacks comprehensive rainfall
   data and gauging stations. The most detailed topographic maps are on a
   scale of 1:25 000. Given that the scale was not sufficiently detailed,
   we used aerial photographs enlarged to the scale of 1:8000. The effects
   of Hurricane Mitch mapped on these photographs were regarded as the
   reference event. Flood maps have a dual purpose (1) community emergency
   plans, (2) regional land use planning carried out by local authorities.
   The geomorphological method is based on mapping the geomorphological
   evidence (alluvial fans, preferential stream channels, erosion and
   sedimentation, man-made terraces). Following the interpretation of the
   photographs this information was validated on the field and complemented
   by eyewitness reports such as the height of water and flow typology. In
   addition, community workshops were organized to obtain information about
   the evolution and the impact of the phenomena. The superimposition of
   this information enables us to obtain a comprehensive geomorphological
   map. Another aim of the study was the calculation of the peak discharge
   using the Manning and the paleohydraulic methods and estimates based on
   geomorphologic criterion. The results were compared with those obtained
   using the rational method. Significant differences in the order of
   magnitude of the calculated discharges were noted. The rational method
   underestimated the results owing to short and discontinuous periods of
   rainfall data with the result that probabilistic equations cannot be
   applied. The Manning method yields a wide range of results because of
   its dependence on the roughness coefficient. The paleohydraulic method
   yielded higher values than the rational and Manning methods. However, it
   should be pointed out that it is possible that bigger boulders could
   have been moved had they existed. These discharge values are lower than
   those obtained by the geomorphological estimates, i.e. much closer to
   reality. The flood hazard maps were derived from the comprehensive
   geomorphological map. Three categories of hazard were established (very
   high, high and moderate) using flood energy, water height and velocity
   flow deduced from geomorphological and eyewitness reports.}},

Abstract = {{Flooding in unplanned settlements in Lusaka is expected, even in years
   of normal rainfall. There is always much discussion of needed action
   when flooding occurs but, as soon as the seasonal rains stop, the
   incidents are forgotten. Most of the households affected by flooding are
   poor and the flooding damages or destroys their homes and belongings,
   which might have taken years to accrue. Poorer groups may be faulted for
   settling on sites at risk from flooding, but this is usually because
   they can find no safer alternative. In addition, as this paper shows,
   reducing flood risks in one settlement can increase flood risks in
   others. Local authorities need to be vigilant in stopping settlement in
   unstable zones and they need to increase awareness of the need for
   action in settlements already built in flood-prone areas. Ways also need
   to be sought to provide low-income households with alternatives to
   informal settlements in flood-prone sites. It is hard to stop people
   from erecting houses where they see vacant land. Since rain in Zambia is
   seasonal, many marshy areas have been built on during dry periods only
   to be flooded when the rains come. In the end, it is the poor who lose
   and a solution needs to be found before more lives and property are
   lost.}},

Abstract = {{Severe rainfall associated with the passage of super-typhoon
   ``Reming{''} on November 30, 2006 triggered lahar flows, landslides and
   flash floods on the south-eastern quadrant of Mayon Volcano, resulting
   in extensive damage to life and property. Among the affected areas, the
   towns of Guinobatan, Camalig and Daraga suffered the most damage, with
   numerous houses, roads and other infrastructures either buried or swept
   away by the flowing lahar and rampaging floodwaters. This paper outlines
   the observations from the reconnaissance work conducted at the affected
   sites following the disaster, with emphasis on the hydro-geological
   aspects of the disaster and their impact on civil engineering structures
   and other infrastructures. Moreover, the properties of the lahar samples
   obtained near Mayon Volcano were analyzed and compared with the lahar

Abstract = {{The increasing land-use activities in European mountain regions have led
   to a considerable threat of natural hazards such as flash floods and
   debris flows in areas used for settlement purposes and economic
   activities. To mitigate associated losses, traditional protective
   measures, including check dams and retention basins, were commonly
   implemented by public authorities. However, due to the scarceness of
   public funds, efficient protection alternatives have to be developed to
   reduce future expenditures. Supplementing the concept of integral risk
   management, this efficiency can be obtained by local structural
   protection, reducing the vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure
   facilities considerably. However, data related to the effects of local
   structural protection measures to reduce losses has not been quantified
   satisfyingly so far, and the associated decrease in vulnerability has
   hardly been measured until now. In this paper, results of a comparative
   standardised cost benefit analysis are presented. Different mitigation
   strategies were assessed and the benefit of local structural measures
   was quantified. The results suggest that local structural measures
   reduce the vulnerability of buildings towards natural hazards
   considerably, and that they therefore should be considered as either
   additional or even alternative mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Flood risk has long been seen only as a hydrological phenomenon. Flood
   risk management has therefore been directed almost exclusively toward
   curative methods. Dykes and dams have attempted to contain the floods
   while crisis management and insurance have compensated for loss.
   However, the acknowledgement of human responsibility in natural
   disasters has widened the epistemological field of natural-hazards
   knowledge integrating the concept of vulnerability. Recent and
   disastrous floods all over the world have highlighted the relative
   failure of the existing risk-management system. Over the past fifteen
   years, the increasing cost of damage has caused a reaction of the
   authorities, who have expressed through various laws and incentive
   measures their wish to develop integrated risk management. The
   integrated approach uses not only curative methods but also land-use
   planning, reduction of vulnerability and the development of public
   awareness by implementing local emergency plans. Through some examples
   in France, this presentation aims to suggest new ways of assessing
   risk-management measures. The French territory, located between northern
   and southern Europe, is concerned by all kinds of floods: slow-rise
   floods in its northern part and flash floods in mountainous and
   Mediterranean regions. For many years, the top-down institutional
   approach has led to the implementation of measures ill-adapted to
   Mediterranean regions. Thus, this presentation shows how some measures,
   efficient for slow floods, are inefficient for Mediterranean torrential
   floods. While the new European Directive on Flood Risk is willing to
   reinforce flood prevention in Europe, it is important to take into
   account the specific characteristics of each basin and each hydrological
   context before implementing flood-reduction measures such as upstream
   control, Vulnerability reduction or flood warning. Stakeholders and
   institutions might implement an adaptive and territorial approach in
   flood prevention so as not to repeat the serious mistakes that we have
   seen for many years.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to investigate the detailed hydrometeorological
   circumstances that lead to accidental casualties, and to better
   understand the prominent physical factors of risk. Based on an event
   that affected the Gard region (Southern France) in September 2002, it is
   a first attempt to combine analysis of the physical and human response
   to Mediterranean storms.
   After details concerning the methodology (for meteorological,
   hydrological and casualty analysis), the local context and the event,
   the authors examine two points: the dynamics of the event (flash-flood
   and riverine-flood response to the storm) together with human exposure
   on the one hand, and scale as a critical problem affecting flood risk on
   the other.
   This investigation stresses the specificity of small catchments, which
   are more dangerous both in hydrological and human terms. Moreover, this
   contribution linking social sciences and geophysics constitutes an
   important step in what {[}Morss, R.E., Wilhelmi, O.V., Downton, M.W.,

Abstract = {{The southern part of France near the Mediterranean Sea is subject to
   flash floods generated by heavy rainfalls typical of the Mediterranean
   climate. In November 1999 (the 12th and 13th) and in September 2002 (the
   8th and 9th), 5000 kin 2 were touched by rainfalls superior to 200mm in
   the departments of Aude and Gard. In both cases, maximum precipitation
   exceeded 500 min within 24 h. The damage amounted in the hundreds of
   millions of euros, and there were numerous fatalities: 35 in 1999, and
   23 in 2002. Following a survey of available data, this article details
   the cost of the damage for both flash flood events. The distribution of
   the damage is quantified by sector of activity (e.g., industry,
   agriculture). The average ratio ``euros of loss per inhabitant{''} is
   quite similar in both cases, but this average hides some geographical
   discrepancies. Losses in industry can locally worsen the overall toll.
   The mapping of damage on a local scale and the amount of losses per
   inhabitant demonstrate that rural areas underwent heavy losses. This was
   mostly due to the destruction of the public infrastructures (e.g.,
   roads, bridges) that represented more than half of the overall loss. In
   some rural areas, the cost of flash floods can exceed 15,000 euros per
   inhabitant. Such flood prevention issues as flood warning systems and
   land use planning must not focus only on the cities. Death, injury and
   heavy material losses also disadvantage the rural and mountainous areas
   where populations and activities are concentrated near rivers. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Given their unique natural attractions, including the highest mountain
   range in the world, the Nepalese Himalayas have long been a Mecca for
   trekkers and mountaineers. Nature-based tourism in the Nepalese
   Himalayas, however, is highly vulnerable to change in climatic
   conditions. This paper proposes a conceptual framework based on Jodha's
   mountain specificities, which include inaccessibility, fragility,
   marginality, diversity and niche, to examine the impacts and
   vulnerability of climate change on tourism in the Himalayas, with the
   cases of the three most popular protected areas of Nepal - Mt Everest
   National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area and Chitwan National Park -
   located in three physiographic zones. Each physiographic zone differs
   greatly and hence presents potentially different impacts and
   vulnerability to climate change. Avalanches and glacial lake outburst
   floods are the major hazards in high mountains; landslides, debris flows
   and flash floods are common in the hills; and floods are rampant in
   lowland Terai. The effects of these climate-related hazards on tourism
   are further exacerbated by mountain characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to examine how Current techniques for
   flash-flood monitoring and forecasting can meet the needs of the
   Population at risk to evaluate the flood severity and anticipate its
   danger. To this end, the social response time for different social
   actions in the course of two well studied flash flood events which
   Occurred ill France and Italy is identified. The event management
   activities are broadly characterized into three types according to their
   main objective (information, organisation and protection). The
   activities are also classified into three other types according, to the
   scale and nature of the human group involved (individuals, communities
   and institutions). The conclusions reached relate to (1) the
   characterisation of the social responses according to watershed scale
   and to the information available, and (2) to the appropriateness of the
   existing surveillance and forecasting tools to Support the social
   responses. Results suggest that representing the dynamics of the social
   response with just one number representing the average time for warning
   a population is an oversimplification. It appears that the social
   response time exhibits a parallel with the hydrological response time by
   diminishing in time with decreasing size of the relevant watershed. A
   second result is that the human groups have different capabilities of
   anticipation, apparently based oil the nature of information they use.
   Comparing watershed response times and social response times shows
   clearly that at scales of less than 100 km(2), a number of actions were
   taken with response times comparable to the catchment response time. The
   implications for adapting the warning processes to social scales
   (individual or organisational scales) are considerable. At small scales,
   and for the implied anticipation times. the reliable and high-resolution
   description of the actual rainfall field becomes the major Source of
   information for decision-making processes Such as deciding between
   evacuations or advising to stay home. This points to the need to improve
   the accuracy and quality control of real time radar rainfall data,
   especially for extreme flash flood-generating storms. Copyright (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Golestan province located in NE Iran is well known for deadly flash
   floods. This study aimed to evaluate the region's Early Warning System
   (EWS) for flash floods. We used an adapted version of the questionnaire
   developed by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster
   Reduction. We reviewed documents on the EWS of Golestan, and conducted a
   qualitative study comprising interviews with experts and affected people
   in Kalaleh and Minoodasht. Results were discussed by an expert panel.
   Regarding risk knowledge, there was a hazard map at Provincial Disaster
   Taskforce (PDT) drawn by the provincial Office for Water Resource
   Management, but no risk analysis was available. Local people were aware
   of their exposure to flooding, but not aware of the existence of a
   hazard map and their vulnerability situation. In terms of monitoring and
   warning, PDT faced serious limitations in issuing Early Warnings,
   including (1) an inability to make point predictions of rainfall, and
   (2) the absence of a warning threshold. Dissemination and communication
   issued by the Meteorological Office followed a top-to-bottom direction.
   The contents were neither clearly understood by other institutions nor
   reached the potential recipients within an appropriate time frame. There
   was a need for a comprehensive response plan with adequate exercises,
   and no evaluation framework existed. Golestan EWS is in dire need of
   improvement. To fill in the gaps ensuring local people receive timely
   warning, we propose a community-based model called ``Village Disaster
   Taskforce{''} (VDT) in which individual villages act as operational
   units, but interlinked with other villages and PDT.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the initial results of a common methodology for the
   evaluation of damage produced by a flood. A model has been developed for
   flood damage estimation based on a geographic information system (GIS).
   It could be used by land administration bodies and insurance companies
   to manage flood-related damage data. The model simulates flood scenarios
   and evaluates expected economic losses from the impact of floodwaters on
   exposed elements, through the application of a computational model
   elaborated by GIS. During the development of the model, the Boesio
   Stream, a small watercourse flowing into Lake Maggiore (Lombardy,
   northern Italy) which was recently affected by a flash flood, was used
   as case study to test and calibrate the methodology. The method could be
   used either as a forecasting tool to define event scenarios, utilizing
   data from events simulated with a hydraulic model, or for real-time
   damage assessment after a disaster. The approach is suitable to
   large-area damage assessment and could be appropriate for land use
   planning, civil protection and risk mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{Debris flow is very common in mountain regions. Generally, it occurs due
   to slope failure, flash flooding and high rainfall. Anthropogenic
   factors further accentuate its intensity. It has negative impacts on the
   environment and economy of the affected regions as well as oil flora and
   fauna. Similarly, debris flow impacts the economy with loss of
   agricultural land, existing crops, settlements, public and private
   property and human lives. A case Study of two debris-flow zones of file
   Pindar Basin of the Garhwal Himalaya has been carried Out. The intensity
   and magnitude of debris flow in two zones vary from each other. In both,
   debris flows resulted from high precipitation (cloudbursts) in the
   highlands and their impacts were concentrated in the valley regions
   (gangar). The highlands are characterized by dense forest and steep
   slopes, while valley regions are characterized by gentle slopes with
   vast agricultural fields and human settlements. Heavy losses of life and
   in the economy and environment recur. This paper aims to examine the
   impact of debris flows on the environment and economy of the affected
   areas of the Garhwal Himalaya in general and two case-study zones in
   particular. Data were gathered in the field and from primary sources
   including interviews with affected people.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a case study regarding a site in the Murge karst
   (Apulia, southern Italy) where, in the course of time, anthropogenic
   activity has caused significant damage to the natural landscape and
   environment, also in terms of loss of human lives. The study site
   comprises the city of Bari and the neighbouring towns, belonging to the
   same catchment basin, which is characterised by a low-relief karst very
   rich in natural cavities and dry valleys, the latter locally called
   lame. From the second half of the 1500s until today, in the whole area,
   short rainfall storms (lasting less than 6 h) with disastrous and mortal
   consequences have been recorded many times. In the last decades, human
   activities, such as urbanization, stone clearing for agricultural
   purposes, quarrying and deforestation induced severe changes in the
   karst landscape causing the modification of the surficial and
   underground drainage. In particular, an examination is made of the
   factors causing the complete destruction of the ``di Maso{''} Park on
   the night between 22 and 23 October 2005, in consequence of a
   high-intensity rainfall (152.6 mm in a 6-h period) accompanied by flash
   flooding. Finally, the need for a better understanding of natural
   processes and patterns in karst areas, and the interactions with human
   activities through to the development of environmental management
   systems ensuring further steps towards sustainable development is
   remarked.}},

Abstract = {{Gujarat is the third most urbanised states in India and is currently
   experiencing a very high rate of economic growth. High levels of
   urbanisation have made much of the urban areas highly impermeable. This
   has made urban areas more vulnerable to water-related disasters. At the
   same time, the overall occurrence rate of climatic induced water-related
   disasters in Gujarat has increased. Recent flash floods have shown their
   adverse impact on urban areas and the existing management of the water
   supply is inefficient and unable to cope with the high risk of
   water-related disasters. Often, it is the poorest city dwellers who are
   most affected by this mismanagement. The current disaster management
   plan is inadequate and does not consider proactive risk reduction
   strategies. This paper has assessed the risk and vulnerability aspects
   of urban disasters in Gujarat and has proposes more concrete strategies.
   There is a need to have strong disaster management strategies which not
   only reduce the risk due to water-related disasters, but also augment
   access to sage, urban water resources for all urban dwellers.}},

Abstract = {{During recent years, Romania has experienced many floods, causing huge
   material damage and many losses of life. The paper presents in detail
   some of the main factors enhancing Nature's ``protest against global
   warming{''}: poor sewage within the towns, illegal deforestation of
   hills or Mountains slopes, dirty river banks, lack of citizens'
   education and responsibility, slow communication between different
   authorities, absence of specialized equipment, and in some cases,
   political or economical interests. Romanian authorities, having in mind
   the floods of 2005 and 2006, try to prevent these disasters or to
   mitigate their effects, but up to now there has been a big gap between
   theory and practice, mainly because of the complexity of the actions to
   be taken, which require time and money.}},

Title = {{Dealing with uncertainty: an analysis of the severe weather events over
   Italy in 2006}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1775-1786}},
Abstract = {{Forecast verification is a long-standing issue of the whole
   meteorologists' community. A common definition of a truly satisfying
   prediction skill has not been achieved so far. Even the definition of
   `event', due to its spatio-temporal discontinuity, is highly affected by
   uncertainty.
   Moreover, decision-making demands numerical weather prediction modellers
   to provide information about the `inner' uncertainty, i.e. the degree of
   uncertainty related to the choice of a specific setting of the model
   (microphysics, turbulence scheme, convective closure, etc.).
   Most European Mediterranean countries, due to dense development, steep
   coastal orography and short hydrological response time of the drainage
   basins, have to deal very frequently with flash floods and sudden
   shallow land sliding impacting on urban areas. Civil protection
   organizations are in place to issue early warnings in order to allow
   local authorities and population to take precautionary measures. To do
   so in Mediterranean catchments, hydrologists are required to use
   numerical rainfall predictions in place of rainfall observations on
   large European catchments.
   Estimating the measure of uncertainty is for this reason crucial.
   The goal of this work is to propose an objective evaluation of the
   performance of the currently operational weather prediction model
   COSMO-I7 over quite a long time period and to check forecast
   verification at different space-time scales by the comparison of
   predictions with observations.
   Due to large investments in the last years, in fact, Italy has built up
   one of the most dense hourly-reporting network of rain gauges. The
   network has a mean space density of about 1/100 km(2), very similar to
   the horizontal resolution of currently operating limited area models.
   An objective procedure to identify and compare the extreme events of
   precipitation has been applied to the full set of rainfall observations
   and over the severe events forecast by COSMO-I7 and announced in
   official warnings by Italian Civil Protection Department.
   The procedure allows to classify rainfall events as long-lived and
   spatially distributed or as having a shorter duration and a minor
   spatial extent. We show that long-lived events are less affected by
   overall uncertainty than short-lived ones, yet the inner uncertainty of
   the event affects both.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to review the current knowledge on flash
   floods occurring at the end of the spring or during the summer on the
   loamy plateaus of the Parisian Basin, in northwestern France.
   Classically named muddy floods', such hydrological hazards are
   significant as they cause losses of life and significant damage on
   buildings and infrastructures. However, they still remain poorly
   documented. We propose here to precise their characteristics by studying
   flash floods events i) at the local scale thanks to several systematic
   investigations on various catchments and ii) at the regional scale using
   a specific database recording 269 events on 189 catchments between 1983
   and 2005. We focused on material and human damage but not on the main
   triggering factors that could explain their occurrence. Results
   highlight that these streamflows are characterized by sub-torrential
   dynamics, with high sediment contents and time-responses to high
   rainfalls (>50 nun in less than 15 h) of less than one hour. Most of the
   basins (<40 km(2)) are dry valleys, i.e., permanent stream-flow does not
   normally exist during normal periods. Diffusive runoff rapidly shifts to
   concentrated runoff, generating high-incised gullies over short
   distances. Erosive forms with a depth of several meters and a lateral
   extension exceeding 10 m are observed in compact loamy soils but the
   major incisions generally appear at the outlet of 1st- or 2nd-order
   basins. The morphological component explains this paradox. Because of
   high-slopes and a rapid steep sidedness, runoff energy compensates the
   low amount of water. Thalwegs of 3rd- or 4th-order basins are therefore
   more adapted to evacuate important discharges (weak slope, large
   channel). Consequently, they decrease the erosive capacity of
   streamflows. High specific discharges (ranging from 1 to 2
   m(3).s(-1).km(-2)) and high specific stream powers (from 22 to 511
   W/m(2)) are linked to major morphogenic impacts on these small-sized
   basins. The final part of tins paper discusses the risk generated by
   flash floods on local population. If events and damage are rarely
   observed on similar catchments, they are frequent on a regional scale
   with 8 to 9 events observed per year in the studied areas.}},

Abstract = {{In flash flood prone areas, roads are often the first assets affected by
   inundations which make rescue operations difficult and represent a major
   threat to lives: almost half of the victims are car passengers trapped
   by floods. In the past years, the Gard region (France) road management
   services have realized an extensive inventory of the known road
   submersions that occurred during the last 40 years. This inventory
   provided an unique opportunity to analyse the causes of road flooding in
   an area frequently affected by severe flash floods. It will be used to
   develop a road submersion susceptibility rating method, representing the
   first element of a road warning system.
   This paper presents the results of the analysis of this data set. A
   companion paper will show how the proposed road susceptibility rating
   method can be combined with distributed rainfall-runoff simulations to
   provide accurate road submersion risk maps.
   The very low correlation between the various possible explanatory
   factors and the susceptibility to flooding measured by the number of
   past observed submersions implied the use of particular statistical
   analysis methods based on the general principals of the discriminant
   analysis.
   The analysis led to the definition of four susceptibility classes for
   river crossing road sections. Validation tests confirmed that this
   classification is robust, at least in the considered area. One major
   outcome of the analysis is that the susceptibility to flooding is rather
   linked to the location of the road sections than to the size of the
   river crossing structure (bridge or culvert).}},

Abstract = {{In any flash flood evacuation operation, vehicle assignment at the
   inundated areas is vital to help eliminate loss of life. Vehicles of
   various types and capacities are used to evacuate victims to relief
   centers. This paper examines combinatorial optimization approach with
   the objective function to assign a specified number of vehicles with
   maximum number of evacuees to the potential inundated areas. Discrete
   particle swarm optimization (DPSO) and improved DPSO are proposed and
   experimented on. Results are presented and compared. Improved DPSO with
   the proposed min-max approach yields better performance for all four
   testing categories. Experimenting on a large number of evacuees could
   further improve the performance of the DPSO.}},

Abstract = {{One of the accepted scenarios of climate change is that we will
   experience more deluges, especially in areas that are subject to severe
   storms. Failure to prepare for, and adequately warn residents about,
   such rain events was evident in storm deluges in 2008/2009 in South-East
   Queensland and mega floods in northern Queensland which spread to cover
   over 70\% of the state with continued heavy rainfalls. The lack of
   adequate infrastructure to mitigate the effects of the precipitation
   reminds us how important it is to study previous events and to learn
   from them. One of the neglected areas of flash flooding and mega floods
   is that of backbuilding. South-East Queensland has experienced flood
   events of differing magnitudes during many of the summer seasons in the
   past three decades, with the 1974 flood being the most significant. At
   the time of writing this chapter, because of the severe drought in
   Australia in recent years, no further opportunities had arisen to update
   the information on flooding realities, although SEQ Water has
   comparatively recently completed a \$70 million Wivenhoe Dam upgrade
   project which involved the construction of a 165-meter wide spillway and
   related works to mitigate a 1 in 100,000-year flood scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, rapid development of the Klang Valley has tended to squeeze
   settlement developments into fragile areas, particularly flood plains,
   due to the limited supply of suitable non-hazardous land. Developments
   on these flood plains will be exposed to the risk of flooding. The Klang
   Valley is well known for its serious problems with flash floods: they
   generally occur four to five times a year and sometimes more often. Two
   to three hours of heavy rain is enough to cause the river in the Klang
   Valley to reach its peak discharge. Flash floods have led to intangible
   psychological impacts on the effected residents. This research will
   discuss the psychological impacts of flash flooding in two residential
   areas with different levels of living community and different housing
   constructions. The first is the properly planned settlement of TTDI Jaya
   and the second is the squatter settlement of Kampung Haji Abdullah
   Hukom. The information discussed here is drawn from interviews with the
   residents and questionnaire surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Typically flash floods are studied ex post facto in response to a major
   Impact event A complement to field investigations is developing a
   detailed database of flash flood events including minor events and null
   reports (i e where heavy ram occurred but there was no flash flooding)
   based on public survey questions conducted in near-real time The Severe
   hazards analysis and verification experiment (SHAVE) has been in
   operation at the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) in Norman OK
   USA during the summers since 2006 The experiment employs undergraduate
   students to analyse real-time products from weather radars target
   specific regions within the conterminous US and poll public residences
   and businesses regarding the occurrence and severity of hail wind
   tornadoes and now flash floods In addition to providing a rich learning
   experience for students SHAVE has also been successful in creating
   high-resolution datasets of severe hazards used for algorithm and model
   verification This paper describes the criteria used to initiate the
   flash flood survey the specific questions asked and information entered
   to the database and then provides an analysis of results for flash flood
   data collected during the summer of 2008 It is envisioned that specific
   details provided by the SHAVE flash flood observation database will
   complement databases collected by operational agencies (i e US National
   Weather Service Storm Data reports) and thus lead to better tools to
   predict the likelihood of flash floods and ultimately reduce their

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this article, disasters are understood as processes that have
   different impacts on social routines in terms of scale, scope and
   duration. The extent of adaptive processes in society can provide the
   ground for a rough classification of disaster types. Such classification
   has, on the one hand, practical and analytical advantages. On the other
   hand, they harbour the danger of overlooking transitions of scale and
   discourage comprehensive scale-related learning forms. Based on the
   disaster scale by Fischer (Int J Mass Emerg Disasters 1:91-107, 2003),
   flash floods in mountain rivers and torrents are described as extreme
   emergencies or small-town disasters. Three given examples will clearly
   show that learning rarely takes place within an institutional setting
   that is subjected to small disasters, because the stakeholder's focus
   remains on only one level. Therefore, we propose to implement a system
   of self-organised and scale-independent learning, so called deutero
   learning, within the political subsystem. Following a damaging event,
   participative processes that involve all levels should be initialised.
   Their task would be to assess the combination of causes and draw
   conclusions for mitigation measures. An aggregation of these assessments
   would help the responsible political subsystems to adapt the current
   natural disasters policy to the changing environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{As a consequence of the process of suburbanisation and the decrease of
   natural landscapes and permeable soil surfaces rainfall triggered,
   increased surface runoff and so-called urban floods are often causes
   significant loss in human properties and may pose a threat to human
   lives Such processes are studied for the Bukkosd Stream catchment, SW
   Hungary using the topographical, surface water and land use databases
   The villages of Bukkosd and Hetvehely as part of the Pecs agglomeration
   have been impounded by floodwaters several times since regular
   observations began To mitigate future economic losses the objective of
   the present study was to carry out a rapid method (vertical distance
   based inundation mapping, VDBIM) to delineate the extent of impounded
   areas at 1 m 5 m and 10 m above the actual riverbed Total inundated
   areas in the floodplain of the Bukkosd Stream cover 102 ha, 151 ha and
   178 ha at water depths of 1 m 5 m and 10 m, respectively Due to the
   narrow valleys in the headwater section of the catchment the combined
   area of the flooded valleys was only 1 75 larger at 10-m water depth
   than at 1-m impoundment Impounded areas include residential areas
   transport routes (primarily the railway) industrial estates, and
   agricultural and food processing facilities Flash floods pose a
   significant threat to railway embankments as this strategic importance

Abstract = {{The average annual cost of floods in the United States has been
   estimated at about \$2 billion (current US dollars) The federal
   government, through the creation of the National Flood Insurance Program
   (NFIP), has assumed responsibility for mitigating the societal and
   economic impacts of flooding by establishing a national policy that
   provides subsidized flood insurance Increased flood costs during the
   past two decades have made the NFIP operate at a deficit This paper
   argues that our current understanding of climate change and of the
   sensitivity of the urban environment to floods call for changes to the
   flood policy scheme Conclusions are drawn on specific examples from
   cities along the heavily urbanized corridor of northeastern United
   States Mesoscale and global models along with urbanization and economic
   growth statistics are used to provide insights and recommendations for
   future flood costs under different emissions scenarios Mesoscale
   modeling and future projections from global models suggest, for example,
   that under a high emissions scenario, New York City could experience
   almost twice as many days of extreme precipitation that cause flood
   damage and are disruptive to business as today The results of the paper
   suggest that annual flood costs in the United States will increase
   sharply by the end of the 21st Century, ranging from about \$7 to \$19
   billion current US dollars, depending on the economic growth rate and
   the emissions scenarios Hydrologic, hydraulic and other related
   uncertainties are addressed and a revised version of the NFIP is
   suggested}},

Abstract = {{This article deals with mapping exposure (or external vulnerability) to
   flood risk in two typical Mediterranean ephemeral streams the Barranco
   de Carraixet and the Rambla de Poyo The floodplains of both streams are
   within the metropolitan area of the city of Valencia (Spain s third
   largest city) Following the Mediterranean model they are very fertile
   areas (with intense periurban and highly productive agriculture) which
   have recently absorbed the great urban expansion of the metropolis
   Hydrologically these basins remain dry for most of the year but become
   particularly dangerous during flash-flood events They generate a risk
   pattern highly dependent on exposure since in general the hazard factor
   is very difficult to map given the unpredictable nature of flash-floods
   This work constitutes a proof of concept based on simple estimators
   obtained from land uses External vulnerability or exposure is evaluated
   as a function of economic land value and human exposure to hazard Land
   value is directly taken from the cadastre whilst human exposure is
   indirectly estimated from the location of population in relation to
   time-activity profiles The temporal dimension is Introduced and three
   exposure scenarios have been mapped related to different time periods
   working days nights weekends and holidays
   The results show different patterns of exposure for each plain In
   Carraixet floodplain exposure is greater at night and on weekends and
   holidays than during working hours on account of the dominant
   agricultural and residential land uses In the Poyo plain there are no
   major contrasts in absolute terms between day and night time although
   spatial patterns of exposure vary from day to night during the day
   exposure is higher in industrial and commercial areas (around
   communication routes) whilst at night residential areas show more
   exposure (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The increase in intensity of torrential rains of Romania over the last
   decades, as a consequence of the general tendency of global warming, has
   triggered many flash-floods especially in small and very small river
   basins which in turn have generated a lot of damages, from loss of human
   lives to important material prejudices. The paper focuses on determining
   the vulnerability degree of small river basins from Some river basin
   regarding flash-floods in general and is composed primarily of two
   parts: in the first part we have presented one of the most destructive
   flash floods that took place in Some river basin, on the 20-21 June
   2006, in the second part we have calculated an index that estimates the
   vulnerability degree that small river basins from Some river basin have
   when discussing the matter of flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the changing properties of losses due to
   occurrences of droughts, floods and typhoon disasters in the Guangdong
   province, a comparatively economically prosperous province in the south
   China. Influences of typhoon activities on droughts and floods are also
   analysed. Results based on extensive and thorough investigations
   indicate that (1) generally, Guangdong province is both humid and warm;
   however, in recent decades, the negative impacts of droughts seem to be
   enhancing, which is proved by increasing drought-induced economic loss.
   In this sense, considerable importance should be attached to droughts,
   but not solely to floods, in the Guangdong province; (2) low-lying
   terrain of the Guangdong province makes this region easy to be
   influenced by flood inundation. Moreover, highly urbanized areas are
   mostly located in the low-lying areas. Flood-induced loss was increasing
   before 1990s and is decreasing after 1990s, and this should be
   attributed mainly to seasonal shifts of precipitation changes and
   enhancing human mitigation to flood disasters; (3) typhoon activities
   often inflict considerable loss on the economy of the Guangdong
   province. Moreover, flood events in the study region are mostly the
   results of typhoon activities. Flash floods, strong wind and storm surge
   accompanying typhoon activities are the major factors intensifying the
   negative impacts of the typhoon disasters.}},

Abstract = {{Urban floods have adverse impacts on the performance of urban
   infrastructures and the life of residents. The floods cause heavy
   damages and perturbation in the serviceability of urban infrastructures
   as well as transportation. Therefore, different factors affecting the
   urban water flood characteristics should be considered in urban
   development planning, especially in metropolitan areas. In recent years,
   climate change and its consequences have affected the total components
   of the water cycle as well as floods. These effects are intensified in
   urban areas because of the anthropogenic effects they have on the water
   cycle, such as reducing the infiltration capacity of basins,
   construction regardless of the channel's right of way, and disposal of
   sediment and solid wastes into channels that will decrease the channels'
   safe carrying capacity. In this way, incorporating climate change impact
   on urban water studies could help to achieve more reliable results to be
   applied in real-time planning of urban areas through selection of best
   management practices (BMPs). In this study, an algorithm for selecting
   the BMPs to improve the system performance and reliability in dealing
   with urban flash floods is proposed that considers the anthropogenic and
   climate change effects. The suggested algorithm is applied to the Tehran
   metropolitan area drainage system as a case study. First, the future
   rainfall pattern of the study area under climate change impact is
   simulated. Then, the effectiveness of present and future development
   projects for improvement of drainage system performance is evaluated
   under different scenarios. Also, the effect of solid wastes and
   sediments carried with surface runoff in system performance is
   considered. Finally, feasibility of suggested BMPs and their
   effectiveness in urban flood management as well as their related costs
   and benefits are considered. The results of the study show the
   significance of using analytical and management tools in assessing and
   improving the urban drainage system. DOI:

Abstract = {{Urban streams in Korea, which until recently were channeled and served
   only flood control functions, have increasingly attracted attention for
   their potential as urban parks or residential open spaces. Consequently,
   urban stream restoration has been booming and a number of restoration
   projects have been carried out since 1990s. However, increased flash
   flood risks created by climate change are reigniting controversies
   regarding the vulnerability of restored streams to flooding.
   Furthermore, implementation issues including landscape/greening and
   facility design considerations have been under-investigated. This study
   explores these ongoing issues associated with urban stream restoration
   in Korea, as well as attempts to estimate consumers' willingness to pay
   for the restoration process. In particular, this study estimates the
   partial values of natural and recreational attributes of urban streams,
   which can be improved through various types of urban stream restoration
   measures, using conjoint analysis. The findings indicate that improving
   natural attributes by transforming existing concrete-encased streams
   into natural state streams increases the value of an urban stream by
   about 50 USD per household. Improving recreational attributes, either by
   creating a walkway where there is no bank or by expanding facilities to
   the existing walkway, increases the value of an urban stream by about 25
   USD per household. These estimated partial values of urban stream
   attributes imply the relative importance of each attribute and suggest
   policy implications for priority setting and trade-offs in urban
   restoration projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Up to now most of the research into flash flood disaster has
   examined scientific aspects of this natural phenomenon. This paper aims
   to focus on the flash flood disaster scenario of Uttarakhand, a newly
   created Himalayan State in India, on the basis of their severity and
   mechanism so that management efforts can be mounted by the disaster
   managers.
   Design/methodology/approach Besides compiling the hazard- and
   risk-related work done by the various research institutions and
   universities the paper attempts to understand the mechanism responsible
   for this natural hazard.
   Findings Uttrakhand is a state highly prone to disasters. Flash floods
   are disasters that are seasonal in nature and strike during a certain
   period of the year in certain pockets of the state with high frequency.
   Research limitations/implications The analysis is based on observations
   made in the entire state.
   Practical implications Awareness amongst the masses regarding the flash
   flood disaster that is likely to affect them and their life support
   strategy is a must for bringing forth voluntary adoption of the safety
   norms.
   Originality/value Armed with the information about the hazards and their
   spatial distribution, the disaster managers in Uttarakhand may undertake
   certain preventive and mitigative measures for further strengthening and
   streamlining the Disaster Management System in the state and pave the
   way for similar activities in other states of India.}},

Abstract = {{In urban areas, the impacts of flash floods can be very severe as these
   regions are generally densely populated and contain vital
   infrastructure. Parts of the UK have been particularly prone to serious
   urban flooding in recent years, such as Boscastle in 2004. Due to
   climate change, the occurrence of urban flooding is predicted to
   increase in the future, which is likely to lead to increasing flood risk
   to people and property in urban areas. It is therefore appropriate to
   estimate potential flood risk to people and property for improved flood
   risk management. This paper outlines an integrated numerical model for
   estimating flood risk in urban areas. The model includes a module for
   predicting the two-dimensional hydrodynamic characteristics of urban
   floods and a new module for predicting the flood risk to people (both
   children and adults) and property (including vehicles and buildings).
   The hydrodynamic module of this model was verified against laboratory
   experimental data and real flood tracks in urban areas. The integrated
   model was also applied to predict the flood risk to people and property
   for the Boscastle 2004 floods, with different recurrence frequencies.
   The developed integrated model can be used to predict the potential
   flood risk to people and property in urban areas and such predictions
   can be used as a rough assessment in improving flood risk management.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{With the climate change caused by global warming, the occurrence
   probability of urban flooding due to flash floods has increased
   gradually. Flush floods propagate rapidly, which can lead to significant
   hazard to human life and property. Flood hazard to vehicles has become
   more noticeable and frequent in recent years. Therefore, it is important
   to investigate the behaviour of vehicles on flooded streets or roads. In
   the current study, a formula has been derived to predict the incipient
   velocity of flooded vehicles according to the mechanical condition of
   sliding equilibrium. A series of flume experiments were conducted using
   three types of scaled die-cast model vehicles, with two scales being
   tested for each type of vehicle. The experimental data obtained for the
   small-scale model vehicles were used to determine the two parameters in
   the derived formula, and the prediction accuracy of this formula was
   validated using the experimental data obtained for the large-scale model
   vehicles. Finally, the corresponding incipient velocities under various
   incoming depths were computed using this formula for these three
   prototype vehicles. It is found that for a specified vehicle, the value
   of incipient velocity reaches its minimum as the incoming flow depth
   approaches the height of the vehicle, and the smaller and lighter
   vehicle like Mini Cooper is the easiest to start sliding in floodwaters.
   The results can be used as a preliminary assessment to define the hazard
   to vehicles parking on flooded streets or roads.}},

Abstract = {{More than 300 000 people live in the Loire valley, protected from the
   usual floods by high dikes, but also under the constant threat of a
   flash-flood caused by a breach which would give no chance to evacuate on
   time. So a preventive evacuation must be decided and completed before
   such a breach occurs but the authorities would have to assume the heavy
   consequences if in the end, no such breach happens. (I)
   The decision to evacuate must be based on an unambiguous criteria, when
   the predicted level of the flood rises above a safe level, indicating a
   likely breach in the dikes. (II)
   Alas, neither the flood prediction models nor the dike-breach detection
   plans are free of uncertainties. A way to resolve the combined
   uncertainties is to use the measured level of a known flood on D-day,
   and then try to evaluate the errors inherent to the models and the
   accuracy of D-Day predictions using information from D-1,D-2, ... (III)
   Thus, the evacuation plan is designed in successive steps, building on
   the certainties coming for observational data while keeping the capacity
   to reverse as much of the process as long as possible. (IV)}},

Abstract = {{To complement other flood mitigation measures, hydrometeorological
   predictions are often used in decisions leading up to and during floods.
   Understanding the role played by predictions in flood events can help
   forecasters provide more useful information, and it can help decision
   makers use this information more effectively as part of broader flood
   loss-reduction strategies. This article examines the interactions among
   predictions, decisions, and flood-related outcomes by analyzing three
   cases of severe flooding in the United States: the Red River basin flood
   of April 1997 in Grand Forks and Fargo, N. D.; the Fort Collins, Colo.
   flood in July 1997; and the Pescadero Creek basin, California flood in
   February 1998. The floods occurred in different hydrometeorological and
   societal circumstances, had different types of predictive information
   available, and had different societal impacts, providing an opportunity
   to compare and contrast lessons learned. Issues explored include the
   interplay between the floods and their hydrometeorological and societal
   context and the roles of predictions and predictive uncertainty in
   decisions and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to propose preventive maps to provide better
   information on the flash floods occurring on the loamy plains of
   northern France (Paris Basin). Classically-named muddy floods in such
   areas, these events are significant as they cause important damage on
   buildings and infrastructures and can cause loss of life. Few studies
   have focused on these hazards because they affect small-size basins,
   without highly urbanised areas, and rarely occur in the same areas.
   Preventive maps based on the main morphometrics characteristics detected
   on 189 affected basins over the period 1983-2005 and on the spatial
   distribution of built terrain were determined from the regional to local
   scales. First results give relevant information as these maps confirm
   our knowledge on local events, as well as the experience of local
   experts and the flooded population.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, data concerning the historical series of floods which have
   occurred since the 17th century have been collected from a study area
   located in the southernmost province of continental Italy. Damage caused
   by flood events was discussed, together with rainfall regime and trend
   (for the period in which data are available) and with main modifications
   due to population variations. The aim was to assess if the frequency of
   damaging floods is changing, and if there is a role of rainfall and/or
   of anthropic modifications of land-use on these changes. Of 150 damaging
   floods analysed, 4\% of the total were floods which caused damage to
   people, and which mainly occurred in past centuries. Notwithstanding,
   the trend of damaging floods is increasing due to the effects of floods
   observed in the last decades. At the same time, the rainfall trend is
   generally decreasing, as observed at a regional scale, and is not
   significant enough to justify the flood recurrence increase. The
   population trend is characterised by a huge increase observed in recent
   decades. On this basis, the progressive urban enlargement, with no care
   for drainage network characteristics and extreme floods, can be
   considered as the main source of increasing risks due to damaging
   floods.}},

Abstract = {{Vehicles parking in urban areas can often cause various hazards to
   people and buildings when they are swept away by flash floods.
   Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the appropriate criteria of
   vehicle stability in floodwaters. Different forces acting on partially
   submerged vehicles have been analysed, with a mechanics-based formula of
   incipient velocity being derived. Experiments were conducted to obtain
   the conditions of water depth and corresponding velocity at the
   threshold of vehicle instability for three typical types of die-cast
   model vehicles. The data were used to determine two key parameters.
   Incipient velocities for partially submerged prototype vehicles in
   floodwaters were estimated using two different approaches, including the
   predictions using the scale ratios and computations based on the
   formula. These critical conditions using the scale ratios compare well
   with the calculations using the derived formula, and the derived formula
   was also validated by the visually-observed data of swept vehicles in
   flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{The study demonstrates the importance, in general, of adopting a
   geographical (integral) approach and local analysis to determine flood
   risk in small Mediterranean basins, where normally there is no surface
   runoff. At the same time, it highlights the possibilities afforded by a
   post-flood study. More specifically, the study seeks to identify the
   factors that aggravated the impact of the extreme flood event in the
   tourist town of Calpe (Alicante, Spain) on 12 October 2007.
   Our results stress the high volume of discharge that can be generated by
   small basins in the Mediterranean following intense rainfall events that
   may exceed 200 mm/day. For the 4.6 km(2) drainage network studied here,
   we calculate a maximum discharge of 143 m(3)/s, for a return period of
   500 years. This natural risk (high potential discharge in what are
   usually dry basins) is exacerbated by the socioeconomic transformations
   that have taken place along the Mediterranean coast. The expansion of
   urban land use has increased vulnerability to flooding in highly
   attractive tourist zones that are now at high risk of flooding. The
   municipal area recognised as presenting a class ``2{''} qualitative
   vulnerability (on a scale from 1 to 6, where 1 is the most vulnerable)
   rose from 1\% to 34\% between 1956 and 2002. Changes to the basins and
   the traditional drainage systems in endorheic zones have also increased
   vulnerability to flood events. For example, the area occupied by the
   mouth of the main basin analysed here has fallen from 2.4 ha in 1956 to
   just 0.7 ha in 2002.
   The study's main conclusions point to the need to introduce hydrological
   monitoring networks in small drainage systems in ephemeral river basins.
   It also stresses the importance of implementing structural actions to
   facilitate surface runoff discharge. In the mid-to-long term we conclude
   that there should be a declassification of urban land use zones at high
   risk of flooding. Moreover, detailed (local) studies which adopt an
   integral approach in their post-flood analyses should be undertaken to
   identify levels of flood risk and the appropriate land use regulations
   required. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   be modelled in its spatial extends. Additionally the method yields
   adequate results in order to evaluate protection measures.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional building materials may not be appropriate in view of the
   urgency in dealing with flash flood victims which need for immediate
   replacement of destroyed housing at a reasonable cost. Thus, the
   solution lies in making the best use of lightweight sandwich composite
   technology for flash flood victims lost residence in a short time.
   Therefore, this research focuses on comprehensive comparisons in bending
   of LWF sandwich/concrete (RC) composite beams. The flexural response of
   the LWF/RC beams is investigated in terms of crack load, load-deflection
   curves, stiffness, energy absorption capacity, ductility index, ultimate
   flexural load-to-weight ratio, load-strain curves, crack patterns,
   number of cracks, average crack width, crack spacing, and the failure
   mode. The test results reveal the remarkable enhancement in the flexural
   behavior and potential application for reconstruction of flash flood
   victims lost residence utilizing lightweight sandwich composite
   technology. The method outlined by ACI Building Code is used to compute
   ultimate moment capacities. The results obtained using this method are
   compared with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Global warming is expected to make the climate warmer, wetter, and
   wilder. It is predicted that such climate change will increase the
   severity and frequency of climate-related disasters like flash floods,
   surges, cyclones, and severe storms. This article uses econometric
   methods to study the consequences of climate-induced natural disasters
   on economic growth, and how these disasters are linked to the onset of
   armed civil conflict either directly or via their impact on economic
   growth. The results show that climate-related natural disasters have a
   negative effect on growth and that the impact is considerable. The
   analysis of conflict onset shows that climate-related natural disasters
   do not increase the risk of armed conflict. This is also true when we
   instrument the change in GDP growth by climatic disasters. The result is
   robust to inclusion of country and time fixed effects, different
   estimation techniques, and various operationalization of the disasters
   measure, as well as for conflict incidence and war onset. These findings
   have two major implications: if climate change increases the frequency
   or makes weather-related natural disasters more severe, it is an
   economic concern for countries susceptible to these types of hazards.
   However, our results suggest - based on historical data - that more
   frequent and severe climate-related disasters will not lead to more
   armed conflicts through their effects on GDP growth.}},

Title = {{Damaging events along roads during bad weather periods: a case study in
   Calabria (Italy)}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{365-378}},
Abstract = {{The study focuses on circumstances that affect people during periods of
   bad weather conditions characterised by winds, rainfall, landslides,
   flooding, and storm surges. A methodological approach and its
   application to a study area in southern Italy are presented here. A
   10-yr database was generated by mining data from a newspaper. Damaging
   agents were sorted into five types: flood, urban flooding, landslide,
   wind, and storm surge. Damage to people occurred in 126 cases, causing
   13 victims, 129 injured and about 782 people involved but not injured.
   For cases of floods, urban flooding and landslides, the analysis does
   not highlight straightforward relationships between rainfall and damage
   to people, even if the events showed different features according to the
   months of occurrence. The events occurring between May and October were
   characterised by concentrated and intense rainfall, and between May and
   July, the highest values of hourly (103 mm on the average) and monthly
   rainfall (114 mm on the average) were recorded. Urban flooding and flash
   floods were the most common damaging agents: injured, involved people
   and more rarely, cases with victims were reported.
   Between November and April, the highest number of events was recorded.
   Rainfall presented longer durations and hourly and sub-hourly rainfall
   were lower than those recorded between May and October. Landslides were
   the most frequent damaging agents but the highest number of cases with
   victims, which occurred between November and January, were mainly
   related to floods and urban flooding.
   Motorists represent the totality of the victims; 84\% of the people were
   injured and the whole of people involved. All victims were men, and the
   average age was 43 yr. The primary cause of death was drowning caused by
   floods, and the second was trauma suffered in car accidents caused by
   urban flooding. The high number of motorists rescued in sub-merged cars
   reveals an underestimation of danger in the case of floods, often
   increased by the sense of security related to the familiarity of the
   road. In contrast, in the cases of people involved in landslides, when
   there was enough time to realise the potential risk, people behaved
   appropriately to avoid negative consequences. Of the victims, 50\% were
   killed along fast-flowing roads; this may be related to the high speed
   limit in force on these roads, as a car's speed reduces the reaction
   time of a driver's response to an unexpected situation, whatever the
   damaging agent is. These results can be used in local
   information/education campaigns to both increase risk awareness and
   promote self-protective behaviours.
   Moreover, the mapping of damaging effects pointed out the regional
   sectors in which the high frequency of the events suggests further
   planning of in-depth examinations, which can individuate the critical
   points and local regulator interventions that might change damage
   incidences in the future.}},

Abstract = {{An early warning system (EWS) for flash floods has been developed for
   part of the Sinai peninsula of Egypt, an hyper-arid area confronted with
   limited availability of field data, limited understanding of the
   response of the wadi to rainfall, and a lack of correspondence between
   rainfall data and observed flash flood events. This paper shows that an
   EWS is not a ``mission impossible{''} when confronted with large
   technical and scientific uncertainties and limited data availability.
   Firstly, the EWS has been developed and tested based on the best
   available information, this being quantitative data (field measurements,
   simulations and remote sensing images) complemented with qualitative
   ``expert opinion{''} and local stakeholders' knowledge. Secondly, a set
   of essential parameters has been identified to be estimated or measured
   under data-poor conditions. These are: (1) an inventory of past
   significant rainfall and flash flood events, (2) the spatial and
   temporal distribution of the rainfall events and (3) transmission and
   infiltration losses and (4) thresholds for issuing warnings. Over a
   period of 30 yr (1979-2010), only 20 significant rain events have been
   measured. Nine of these resulted in a flash flood. Five flash floods
   were caused by regional storms and four by local convective storms. The
   results for the 2010 flash flood show that 90\% of the total rainfall
   volume was lost to infiltration and transmission losses. Finally, it is
   discussed that the effectiveness of an EWS is only partially determined
   by technological performance. A strong institutional capacity is equally
   important, especially skilled staff to operate and maintain the system
   and clear communication pathways and emergency procedures in case of an
   upcoming disaster.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes trends in the extent of major floods in the lower
   reach of Songkhram River Basin, one of the most important areas for
   aquatic biological production in the Lower Mekong River Basin. We first
   classified the time series Landsat imagery acquired at a 2-year interval
   between 2000 and 2006 using the unsupervised classification method. We
   then analyzed the extent of major floods through the image matrix
   analysis on seasonal land cover map pairs. Additionally, we estimated
   flood volumes and discharge rates for each time series. We finally
   analyzed the extent of land uses that were affected by major flood
   events. Accuracy assessment showed that the extent of major floods was
   accurately mapped. Analysis of trends of major floods revealed that
   there was a considerable variation in the extent through 2006, with the
   flood decreasing since 2002. Analysis of flood risk areas based on the
   2000-2004 data showed that about 3.04\% of the study areas was at high
   risk of being flooded. Between 2000 and 2006, about 5.5\% of the study
   area that are classified as agriculture and built-up land uses was
   affected by major floods. Our estimates on flood volumes and discharge
   rates are consistent with the data from other studies. Overall findings
   suggest that accurate mapping of major floods and flood risk areas using
   space and time dependent data can be important for developing protocols
   for flash flood early warning and flood risk management and mitigation.
   Output GIS maps and data combined with crude assumptions about water
   flow will serve as the baseline data to estimate the amount of water
   that flows in and out of the basin. Further research should focus on
   integration of social science research to evaluate the socio-economic
   impacts of major floods and identifying coping strategies of affected
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Pakistan has suffered a devastating flood disaster in 2010. In the Kabul
   River basin (92 605 km(2)), large-scale riverine and flash floods caused
   destructive damage with more than 1100 casualties. This study analysed
   rainfall-runoff and inundation in the Kabul River basin with a newly
   developed model that simulates the processes of rainfall-runoff and
   inundation simultaneously based on two-dimensional diffusion wave
   equations. The simulation results showed a good agreement with an
   inundation map produced based on MODIS for large-scale riverine
   flooding. In addition, the simulation identified flash flood-affected
   areas, which were confirmed to be severely damaged based on a housing
   damage distribution map. Since the model is designed to be used even
   immediately after a disaster, it can be a useful tool for analysing
   large-scale flooding and to provide supplemental information to agencies
   for relief operations.}},

   France: the sea surge caused by the storm Xynthia and the flash flood in
   Var}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to analyse and compare the loss of life that occurred
   during two recent floods in France. The first flood was due to a sea
   surge triggered by the storm called Xynthia that hit the Atlantic coast
   on 28 February 2010 (41 flood-related deaths). The second was a flash
   flood that struck the Var Department in the French Mediterranean region
   on 15 June 2010 (26 fatalities). After detailing the assumptions and
   expected outcomes of the study of disaster-related fatalities, the paper
   focuses on the characteristics of the victims and the circumstances of
   their deaths. In the first case, 71\% of the victims were people aged
   over 60 (mainly women) who were surprised while they were sleeping and
   who died in or near their homes. In the case of the flash flood, the
   profiles of the victims were diverse as the flooding occurred in the
   afternoon and many people were trapped in open. The paper also
   highlights the factors that explain mortality. Physical factors such as
   water depth were determined. The relationship between the water depth
   and the age of victims was found to be relevant. In the case of the
   storm surge Xynthia, the correlation between age and water depth is
   positive. For the flash flood, the correlation between age and water
   depth was negative as male adults died in open. In the first case, the
   vulnerability of people was closely linked to human features such as
   type of housing and age that people are not directly responsible for.
   During flash floods, dangerous behaviour by people highlighted the role
   of risk-taking in loss of life. We also examined the particular case of
   the deaths of the children. The paper concludes by discussing the
   factors of vulnerability on frail population such as elderly people or
   marginalized. The lack of risk awareness and crisis preparedness were
   clearly a major factor of vulnerability.}},

   death rates between the sexes was small at ages 19 and younger but males
   died at twice the rate of females for ages 40 and older. Elevated deaths
   rates were found for both males and females under age 5 and over 60.
   Flooding events classified as flash floods accounted for most of the

Abstract = {{Current management of disaster risks is often fragmented due to a lack
   of coordination between involved actors, i.e. civil protection and
   spatial planning - a phenomenon which is known as the `problem of
   interplay'. This paper presents an output-oriented risk management
   approach ('parametric governance'). Here, the modality of the
   achievement of objectives remains in the hands of the given addressees.
   This implies a shift from a top-down to a more collaborative,
   process-oriented form of decision-making. The approach has been
   successfully applied in two hazard cases and three administrative
   contexts: (a) the City of Dortmund (Germany) facing flash floods, (b)
   East Attica region (Greece) facing forest fires, and (c) Lazio Region
   (Italy) also facing forest fires. As proved by the applications of the
   concept, a dialogue among experts, stakeholders, and decision-makers is
   indispensable in order to guarantee inclusion of all diverse and
   competing values, opinions, and claims. Moreover, a structured
   communication path is needed to meet the requirements of a risk
   governance process. Finally, a win-win-situation among the involved
   actors has to be created to reach an agreement on common goals and
   actions to achieve them in due time.}},

Title = {{Spatial variability assessment of river-line floods and flash floods in
   Himalaya A case study using GIS}},
Journal = {{DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT}},

Pages = {{135-159}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The main objective of the study is to identify the vulnerable
   areas for river-line and flash flood hazard and its mitigation through
   GIS Database Management System (DBMS) of geo-hydrometeorological
   parameters. The Dabka watershed constitutes a part of the Kosi Basin in
   the Lesser Himalaya, India in district Nainital has been selected for
   the case illustration.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Dabka DBMS is constituted of three GIS
   (Geographic Information System) modules, i.e. geo-informatics (consists
   of geomorphology, soils, geology and land use pattern, slope analysis,
   drainage density and drainage frequency), weather informatics (consists
   of daily, monthly and annual weather data about temperature, rainfall,
   humidity and evaporation) and hydro-informatics (consist of runoff,
   sediment delivery, and denudation). The geo-informatics and weather
   informatics modules carried out by comprehensive field work and GIS
   mapping than both modules used to carry out hydro-informatics module.
   Through the integration and superimposing of spatial data and attribute
   data with their GIS layers of all these modules prepared Flood Hazard
   Index (FHI) to identify the level of vulnerability for flood hazards and
   their socio-economic and environmental risks.
   Findings - The results suggest that geo-environmentally most stressed
   areas of barren land (i.e. riverbeds, flood plain, denudational hills,
   sites of debris flow, gullies, landslide prone areas etc.) have extreme
   vulnerability for flood hazard due to high rate of runoff, sediment load
   delivery and denudation during rainy season (i.e. respectively 84.56
   l/s/km(2), 78.60 t/km(2) and 1.21 mm/year) whereas in
   geo-environmentally least stressed dense forest areas (i.e. oak, pine
   and mixed forests) have low vulnerability due to low rate of stream
   runoff, sediment load delivery and denudation (i.e. respectively 20.67
   l/s/km(2), 19.50 t/km(2) and 0.20 mm/year). The other frazzled
   geo-environment which also found high vulnerable for flood hazard and
   their risks is agricultural land areas due to high rate of stream
   runoff, sediment load delivery and denudation rates (i.e. respectively
   53.15 l/s/km(2), 90.00 t/km(2) and 0.92 mm/year).
   Research limitations/implications - For hydro-informatics module it is
   quite difficult to monitor water and sediment discharge data from each
   and every stream of the Himalayan terrain due the steep and rugged
   topography. It requires strategic planning and trained man power as well
   as sufficient funds; therefore representative micro-watershed approach
   of varied ecosystem followed for a three years (2006-2008) period.
   Practical implications - The study will have great scientific relevance
   in the field of river-line flood and flash flood hazard and its
   socio-economic and environmental risks prevention and management in
   Himalaya and other mountainous terrain of the world.
   Originality/value - This study generated primary data on
   hydro-informatics and weather informatics to integrate with
   geo-informatics data for flood hazard assessment and mitigation as
   constitutes a part of multidisciplinary project, Department of Science
   and Technology (D.S.T.) Government of India.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the failure risk of masonry constructions under
   the effect of floods. It is developed within a probabilistic framework,
   with loads and resistances considered as random variables. Two
   complementary approaches have been investigated for this purpose:
   - a global approach based on combined effects of several governing
   parameters with individual weighted contribution (material quality and
   geometry, presence and distance between columns, beams, openings,
   resistance of the soil and its slope...),
   - and a reliability method using the failure mechanism of masonry walls
   standing out-plane pressure.
   The evolution of the probability of failure of masonry constructions
   according to the flood water level is analysed.
   The analysis of different failure probability scenarios for masonry
   walls is conducted to calibrate the influence of each ``vulnerability
   governing parameter{''} in the global approach that is widely used in
   risk assessment at the urban or regional scale.
   The global methodology is implemented in a GIS that provides the spatial
   distribution of damage risk for different flood scenarios. A real case
   is considered for the simulations, i.e. Cheffes sur Sarthe (France), for
   which the observed river discharge, the hydraulic load according to the
   Digital Terrain Model, and the structural resistance are considered as
   random variables. The damage probability values provided by both
   approaches are compared. Discussions are also developed about reduction
   and mitigation of the flood disaster at various scales (set of
   structures, city, region) as well as resilience.}},

Abstract = {{The low risk awareness of the residents living in flood-prone areas is
   usually considered among the main causes of their low preparedness,
   which in turns generates inadequate response to natural disasters. In
   this paper, we challenge this assumption by reporting on the results of
   a sociological research in four communities exposed to flood risk in the
   Eastern Italian Alps. The research design included semi-structured
   interviews and focus groups with key local stakeholders and a
   standardized questionnaire submitted to 400 residents. Results revealed
   that residents felt both slightly worried about flood risk and slightly
   prepared to face an event. Considerable differences were found between
   the evaluations of individual subjects as opposed to overall
   communities. There was also a clear discrepancy between the actual
   adoption of household preparatory measures and the willingness to take
   self-protection actions. Overall, the risk awareness was significantly
   higher among those residents who had been personally affected by a flood
   in the past, were living in isolated (vs. urban) communities, in the
   most risky areas or had a lower level of trust in local authorities. The
   improvement of residents' knowledge about their environment and the
   residual risk seemed to be crucial to increase risk awareness, and the
   same was true for the strengthening of local support networks to foster
   preparedness. The link between risk awareness and preparedness was not
   at all straightforward. Results revealed instead the complexity of
   residents' perspectives, attitudes, behaviours and decisions about
   risk-related issues.}},

Abstract = {{The town of Leh and its adjoining areas were affected by severe flash
   floods and mudslides triggered by a cloud burst over the Leh region on 6
   August 2010. Identification of the area affected by flash floods is a
   challenging task under unfavourable weather conditions, collapse of
   communication systems and damage to transportation systems. Rapid
   satellite based assessment of high resolution satellite data from Indian
   Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites Cartosat-1, Cartosat-2B and RISAT-2
   (microwave satellite) was carried out for identification of the
   locations affected by flash floods in the Leh region. Severe damage to
   roads, houses, canals and agricultural fields is observed from the
   analysis of Choglamsar, the worst affected. The present paper discusses
   pre- and post-event satellite based changes observed due to the flash
   floods and mudslides in the Leh region, in general and in Choglamsar
   village, in particular.}},

   analysis and flood hazard}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{3-17}},
Abstract = {{The island of Ischia is particularly susceptible to landslides and flash
   floods due to its particular geological and geomorphological context.
   Urbanization in recent decades coupled with the development of tourism
   has increased the risk. After the November 10, 2009 event occurring in
   the northern sector of the island (the town of Casamicciola), a detailed
   geo-morphological survey was conducted to ascertain the evolution of the
   phenomenon. In the watersheds upstream of Casamicciola, many landslides
   were mapped and the volume of material involved during detachment and
   sliding was estimated. In the lower course area, near the town and
   towards the sea, flow pathways were reconstructed with the aid of
   extensive video footage taken during the event. Rainfall data were also
   analyzed and a relationship was established between the hourly rainfall
   rate and the flash flood. The phenomenon was found to be quite complex,
   with many upstream landslides stopping before reaching the urban area.
   In the lower course the alluvial event occurred as a flood with a very
   small sediment discharge, which left a very thin layer of sediment.
   Reconstruction of the flash flood phenomenon suggested possible action
   for future risk mitigation, early warning and civil protection plans.

Abstract = {{Comprehensive risk assessments are essential to integrated, efficient
   flood management. However, investigations concentrate mainly on
   scenarios of slowly rising riverine floods and their loss assessment.
   The common loss models are focused on the water level as the primary
   factor determining damage, although, for example during flash floods,
   the velocity might be much more important. To improve the knowledge
   about flood losses and the loss-influencing factors, 1697 households
   affected by the Elbe and Danube flood in 2002 were interviewed. Cases
   affected by high groundwater levels, riverine floods, flash floods and
   dyke breaches were identified and separately analyzed. The four flood
   types show significantly different impact characteristics concerning the
   factors of water level, flood duration, flow velocity and contamination.
   In addition, the resulting losses differ significantly. Common loss
   models tested, i.e. stage-damage curves, were as such not suitable to
   estimate losses due to dyke breaches and high groundwater levels.
   Therefore, new loss models should be developed for these special flood
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on cooperative adaptation strategies at the
   community, water user association, district, and national levels along
   the Khojabakirgansai, a small transboundary tributary of the Syr Darya
   in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Data were collected in the basin through
   in-depth expert interviews, site visits, and household surveys, and were
   triangulated with climate change data from the available literature.
   Basin inhabitants cooperate on extreme events that are exacerbated by
   climate change, including water scarcity, droughts, and flash floods.
   Water demand and efficiency are key issues driven by population growth,
   expansion of croplands, and deteriorating canal infrastructure. Lessons
   learned can be considered in other small transboundary tributaries in
   the Ferghana Valley and Central Asia, which demonstrate how, despite the
   international level of tension on water issues in the region, local
   communities can find solutions. Cooperation, however, does not always
   improve the basin environment or living standards, and is likely to be
   strained in the coming decades by climate and population trends, among
   other issues.}},

Abstract = {{The historical floods that have occurred since the seventeenth century
   were collected for a study area in southern Italy. Damages caused by
   floods, rainfall and the main anthropogenic modifications are discussed
   all together. The aim was to assess whether the frequency of floods is
   changing and, if so, whether these changes can be attributed to either
   rainfall and/or anthropogenic modifications. In 4 \% of cases, mainly
   occurred in past centuries, floods damaged people. Hydraulic works,
   roads and private buildings were the more frequently damaged elements
   (25, 18 and 14 \% of the cases, respectively). The annual variability of
   rainfall was discussed using an annual index. Short duration-high
   intensity rainfalls were characterized considering time series of annual
   maxima of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h and daily rainfall. The rainfall shows a
   decreasing trend, in terms of both the annual maximum of short duration
   and the annual amount. The population has been progressively increasing
   since the sixteenth century, except during the years following the
   catastrophic 1908 earthquake. The rate of population growth has been
   very high since the second half of the twentieth century; the urbanized
   areas greatly increased, especially following the second half of the
   twentieth century. At the same time, the trend of damaging floods has
   been increasing, especially since the seventies. The analysis indicates
   that, despite a rainfall trend favourable towards a reduction in flood
   occurrence, floods damage has not decreased. This seems to be mainly the
   effect of mismanagement of land use modifications.}},

Abstract = {{A significant number of crashes on roads are caused by adverse weather
   conditions. Among the most serious consequences of rainfall and flooding
   in regard to road safety are the motor vehicle-related flash flood
   fatalities. These fatalities are of particular concern in Texas.
   Information on motor vehicle fatalities caused by flash floods was
   extracted from the National Climatic Data Center Storm Data reports.
   Review of reports on flash flood fatalities in general, where the death
   circumstances are provided, reveals that most fatalities are motor
   vehicle-related (80\%). Moreover, data from the reports indicate that
   from 1959 to 2009 the number of motor vehicle-related flash flood
   fatalities in Texas exceeds by far the total number of flood fatalities
   in any other state. Demographic analysis of the flash flood fatalities
   indicates that, in Texas, all ages are at risk and that males are much
   more affected than females. Spatial analysis indicates that the highest
   numbers of fatalities occur in counties having major urban areas. The
   increase in the frequency and intensity of storms and floods that is
   projected to result from climate changes and variability, and the rapid
   urbanization in the region may considerably increase the impacts of
   weather on road safety in Texas.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents a framework for the nation-wide assessment of natural
   hazards, vulnerability and risk for the Republic of Georgia. Firstly, a
   relational database was created in order to collect all necessary
   information available. Secondly, hazard maps were drawn based on an
   innovative approach of assessing the magnitude and frequency of
   meteorological hazard types, where the corresponding formalization was
   not yet satisfying. Thirdly, the associated economic losses were
   evaluated and presented in monetary terms for some hazard types
   (droughts, hurricanes, hail, frost, flash floods and earthquakes), while
   for other types of hazards, the information remained descriptive.
   Fourthly, based on the hazard inventory, an approach was developed that
   allowed for the calculation of an overall vulnerability value for each
   individual hazard type, using the Gross Domestic Product per unit area
   (applied to population) as the indicator for elements at risk exposed.
   The correlation between estimated economic losses, physical exposure and
   the magnitude for each of the six types of hazards has been investigated
   in detail by using multiple linear regression analysis. Economic losses
   for all past events were estimated, and historical vulnerability was
   estimated. Finally, the spatial distribution of general vulnerability
   was assessed, and the expected maximum economic loss was calculated as
   well as a multi-risk map was set-up. The presented method will
   contribute to a reduction of disaster losses in Georgia and will foster
   future efforts of harmonization of risk management strategies in the
   country.}},

Abstract = {{Vulnerability studies have evolved significantly in recent decades.
   Although not overly theoretical compared with some other fields of
   science, some important conceptual progress has been made. At the
   practical level, vulnerability indicators have been used either at a
   generic level or for particular hazard contexts. However, these
   indicators are often predictably too narrow in their coverage of aspects
   of vulnerability. An important need remains to produce more conceptually
   informed vulnerability indicators or parameters and more satisfactory
   operational tools to assess weaknesses and resilience in coping with
   natural risks. In this paper, we present the methodology developed in
   the context of a recently concluded EU funded project, ENSURE (Enhancing
   resilience of communities and territories facing natural and na-tech
   hazards). The resulting vulnerability and resilience assessment
   framework tool adopts a systemic approach embedding and integrating as
   much as possible the multifaceted and articulated nature of concepts
   such as vulnerability and resilience. The tool guides evaluators towards
   a comprehensive and context-related understanding of strengths and
   fragilities of a given territory and community with respect to natural
   extremes. In this paper, both the framework tool and its application to
   Sondrio in Italy, which is exposed to flash floods, are presented and
   discussed. The merits and demerits of the new tool are discussed, and
   the results of the application to Sondrio indicate where data are
   currently missing, suggesting the kind of data, which will need to be
   gathered in future to achieve more complete assessments. The results
   also suggest vulnerability reduction policies and actions and further
   ways of revising the existing framework tool in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Makkah city, Saudi Arabia, is periodically exposed to flash floods that
   result in major human and economical damages. That is due to several
   factors including its rugged topography and geological structures.
   Hence, precise assessment of floods becomes a more vital demand in
   development planning. A GIS-based methodology has been developed for
   quantifying and spatially mapping the flood characteristics. The core of
   this new approach is integrating several topographic, metrological,
   geological, and land use data sets in a geographic information system
   (GIS) environment that utilizes the curve number method of flood
   modelling for ungauged arid catchments. Based on the estimated flood
   volume of sub-basins, a hazard factor has been developed to quantify the
   expected hazard level for each road. Applying this proposed approach
   reveals that 21 \% of the road network in Makkah city is subjected to
   low flood hazards, 29 \% is facing medium hazards, and 50 \% of roads
   are exposed to harsh flood impacts. The developed approach may be
   considered a digital precise method that can be easily re-run, in other
   situations or regions, to estimate flood hazards on roads.}},

Abstract = {{The debris flow, which was triggered in the Wenjia Gully on August 13,
   2010, is an extreme example of mass movement events, which occurred
   after the Wenchuan earthquake of May 12, 2008. This Earthquake triggered
   in the Wenjia Gully the second largest co-seismic landslide, which can
   be classified as a rockslide-debris avalanche. A lot of loose sediments
   was deposited in the basin. In the main so called Deposition Area II of
   this landslide, with a volume of 30 x 10(6) m(3), flash floods can
   easily trigger debris flows because of the steep bottom slope and the
   relative small grain sizes of the sediments. The largest debris flow of
   August 13, 2010 destroyed the most downstream dam in the catchment
   during a heavy rain storm. The debris flow with a peak discharge of
   1,530 m(3)/s and a total volume of 3.1 x 10(6) m(3) caused the death of
   7 persons, 5 persons were missing, 39 persons were injured and 479
   houses buried. After three rainy seasons, only 16 \% of the
   landslide-debris deposition was taken away by 5 large-scale debris flow
   events. Since the threshold for rainfall triggered debris flows in the
   Wenjia Gully and other catchments drastically decreased after the
   Wenchuan Earthquake, new catastrophic events are expected in the future
   during the rainy season.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, disasters caused by flash floods with many casualties
   have occurred frequently in China. In order to effectively prevent flash
   flood disasters, the State Council approved the National Flash Flood
   Control Planning (NFFCP) in 2006. In this planning, non-structural
   measures are recommended as the first step to be adopted in the
   prevention of flash floods, debris flow and landslide disasters caused
   by heavy rainfall. In order to effectively build up a comprehensive
   non-structural measure system for flash flood disaster prevention, the
   Ministry of Water Resources has asked the local authorities to conduct
   studies in 103 pilot counties aiming to explore practical schemes. Based
   on the experience from these pilot counties, the construction of
   non-structural measures on flash flood disaster prevention for 1836
   counties was officially initiated in 2010. The contents of
   non-structural measures for flash flood disaster prevention at county
   level include eight aspects. This paper will systematically illustrate
   the main contents of this national project for the construction of
   non-structural measures for flash flood disaster prevention in China.
   This work could provide a reference for other countries and regions in
   terms of flash flood prevention.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the characteristics of the disaster-prone

   barangays purposively selected based on their topographical

   three selected barangays were grouped according to their biophysical
   characteristic, socio-economic characteristic, past experience with
   disaster, and emergency preparedness and adaptation strategies to
   disasters characteristics. The main assumption is that vulnerability to
   disaster such as flash floods and mudslides was dependent on these
   factors and since a significant number of residents were farmers, the
   clusters were named as Low Vulnerable Upland Farmers, Law Vulnerable
   Lowland Non-Farmers, High Vulnerable Coastal Farmers and High Vulnerable
   Coastal Non-Farmers. The clusters in the coastal, low-lying areas whose
   residents were either farmers or non farmers were considered the most
   highly vulnerable communities mainly because they were relatively
   poorer, less prepared for disaster and hadlimited strategies for
   adaption. Being poor was closely associated with being vulnerable.}},

Abstract = {{Flood is a normal ecosystem phenomenon and a natural hydrological
   feature of most river systems. Climate variability may also bring about
   precipitation events that cause floods. However, recent floods in most
   areas may be anthropogenically induced and are on a spatial and temporal
   increase. This study assessed rainfall variability, flooding and the
   adaptations of slum residents to floods in Kumasi, Ghana. Rainfall data
   of Kumasi were collected from the Meteorological Services Department,
   Accra. Basic descriptive statistics of rainfall data were used to
   evaluate the rainfall variability. The Mann-Kendall test was used to
   assess rainfall trends. A survey of residents of flood-prone suburbs was
   conducted to assess their vulnerability and adaptations to floods. The
   results show that rainfall in March and November is significantly
   decreasing. The floods in Kumasi are not due to climate change but bad
   spatial development practices. Most people will pump out water and build
   embankments around their houses as adaptations to the floods. Flooding
   in Kumasi will continue to outwit local government initiatives of storm
   drain construction because the floods are predominantly due to
   development of effluent streams and less from flash floods.}},

Title = {{Integrated analysis of societal vulnerability in an extreme
   precipitation event: A Fort Collins case study}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY}},

Pages = {{49-62}},

Abstract = {{Floods, droughts, heat waves, and storms have always been part of human
   lives because they are a normal part of climate variability. However,
   the observed trends and projected changes in global climate have the
   potential to alter patterns of these climatic hazards and extreme
   weather events. Extreme precipitation is one of the factors that
   contribute to flash floods, but it is the characteristics of the
   environment, individuals, and society that can turn these natural
   phenomena into life-threatening disasters. Past decades of disaster risk
   research and assessments have lead to many innovative approaches to
   integrating data across disciplinary domains. Recent advancements in
   integration of meteorological information with other environmental and
   social data, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), allow for
   integrated spatial assessments of societal vulnerability to
   weather-related hazards. A case study presented in this article builds
   on the substantial body of previous and ongoing research that is focused
   on developing improved methods for characterizing and quantifying
   vulnerabilities to weather hazards, in general, and extreme
   precipitation events, in particular. Integrating social science into
   meteorological research and practice has been a key interdisciplinary
   direction in the meteorological community. Therefore, with specific
   attention to integrating spatially explicit information on weather and
   society, this article focuses on interactions between meteorological and
   social characteristics of an extreme precipitation event that resulted
   in a flash flood disaster in Fort Collins, Colorado. Using the data from
   1997 Fort Collins, Colorado extreme precipitation event, this study
   constructs a straightforward methodology for integrating meteorological
   data with readily available societal information into a GIS-based
   analysis of vulnerable people and places. With the goal of developing
   specific, targeted interventions and flash flood preparedness and
   emergency response actions, the analysis of societal vulnerability
   presented in this paper is specifically focused on the factors affecting
   population's response and coping capacities to an extreme precipitation
   event. Challenges associated with data limitations and integration of
   meteorological and societal data, with diverse units and scales, into a
   standardized relative vulnerability measure are discussed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{We propose a new simplified vision of flood dynamics through temporal
   and spatial scales to enhance understanding of potential and limits of
   human responses to flash floods. Based on data from a set of extreme
   flash floods that occurred in Europe, we analyze both the runoff
   response time of flash floods and the asynchronous character of flood
   peak time generation. We introduce the concept of ``timeliness{''} to
   quantify the balance in time between the hydrological response of
   catchments to heavy storms and the human reactions. Timeliness is
   investigated across the range of spatial scales of concern for flash
   floods and for various types of anticipation actions. Results are
   reported for four extreme flash flood events occurred since 2002 in
   France, Italy and Slovenia. These results indicate that human actions
   adapt their pace to the physical context and are in a kind of
   ``hurrying{''} process as the flood danger approaches in time. They show
   the importance of self-organization and `unofficial' warning in response
   to flash flooding by individuals and groups. The work draws on flood
   hazard research findings from hydrology, meteorology and social science
   and put forward a framework for interdisciplinary collaboration between
   hydrologists and social scientists. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Floods are natural phenomena with significant impact on population,
   material goods and landscape. Flash floods are characterized by a high
   degree of risk, primarily due to reduced possibilities to make effective
   forecasts, but also because of weather and climatic characteristics that
   changed in the last decades, thus limiting the possibilities of
   application of appropriate defense and adaptation measures.
   In this context, the paper aims to make a preliminary assessment of
   vulnerability to flash floods, using hydrological simulation models
   based on GIS techniques applied in sub-basins, allowing a ranking of
   risks within relevant locations, especially concerning the cultural
   heritage in the county of Iasi. The development of methods for
   addressing such conditions creates the scientific basis for planning the
   required resource allocation for the protection of the cultural heritage
   hence for the implementation of water resources management plans and
   territorial development plans.}},

Abstract = {{The July 2002 floods in South Texas resulted from excessive
   precipitation caused by a slow moving tropical wave accompanied by an
   abundance of tropical moisture, which resulted in 12 deaths and nearly
   \$1 billion in damage. South Central Texas is particularly vulnerable to
   floods because of: (1) its proximity to a moist air source (the Gulf of
   Mexico); (2) the Balcones Escarpment, which concentrates rainfall
   runoff; (3) a tendency for synoptic scale features to become cut off and
   stall over the area; and (4) decaying tropical cyclones stalling over
   the area. This paper examines the hydrology of the July 2002 floods in
   three urbanized watersheds in the city of San Antonio and Bexar County,
   Texas. The physically based, distributed parameter gridded surface
   subsurface hydrologic analysis hydrologic model was used to simulate the
   flood over the three watersheds. Various flood control features were
   included in the simulations. The hydrologic model, driven by the next
   generation radar multi-sensor precipitation estimator, was able to
   reasonably simulate runoff in the three watersheds. Differences in the
   responses of the three watersheds were highlighted with the role of
   flood-control hydraulic structures. DOI:

Title = {{Combining criteria for delineating lahar- and flash-flood-prone hazard
   and risk zones for the city of Arequipa, Peru}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Arequipa, the second largest city in Peru, is exposed to many natural
   hazards, most notably earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides,
   lahars (volcanic debris flows), and flash floods. Of these, lahars and
   flash floods, triggered by occasional torrential rainfall, pose the most
   frequently occurring hazards that can affect the city and its environs,
   in particular the areas containing low-income neighbourhoods. This paper
   presents and discusses criteria for delineating areas prone to flash
   flood and lahar hazards, which are localized along the usually dry
   (except for the rainy season) ravines and channels of the Rio Chili and
   its tributaries that dissect the city. Our risk-evaluation study is
   based mostly on field surveys and mapping, but we also took into account
   quality and structural integrity of buildings, available socioeconomic
   data, and information gained from interviews with risk-managers
   officials.
   In our evaluation of the vulnerability of various parts of the city, in
   addition to geological and physical parameters, we also took into
   account selected socio-economic parameters, such as the educational and
   poverty level of the population, unemployment figures, and population
   density. In addition, we utilized a criterion of the ``isolation
   factor{''}, based on distances to access emergency resources (hospitals,
   shelters or safety areas, and water) in each city block. By combining
   the hazard, vulnerability and exposure criteria, we produced detailed
   risk-zone maps at the city-block scale, covering the whole city of
   Arequipa and adjacent suburbs. Not surprisingly, these maps show that
   the areas at high risk coincide with blocks or districts with
   populations at low socioeconomic levels. Inhabitants at greatest risk
   are the poor recent immigrants from rural areas who live in unauthorized
   settlements in the outskirts of the city in the upper parts of the
   valleys. Such settlements are highly exposed to natural hazards and have
   little access to vital resources.
   Our study provides good rationale for the risk zoning of the city, which
   in turn may be used as an educational tool for better understanding the
   potential effects of natural hazards and the exposure of the population
   residing in and around Arequipa. We hope that our work and the
   risk-zonation maps will provide the impetus and basis for
   risk-management authorities of the Municipality and the regional
   government of Arequipa to enforce existing regulations in building in
   hazardous zones and to adopt an effective long-term strategy to reduce
   risks from lahar, flash flood, and other natural hazards.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the development of a database of high-impact
   weather events that occurred in Greece since 2001. The selected events
   are related to the occurrence of floods, flash floods, hail, snow/frost,
   tornados, windstorms, heat waves and lightning with adverse consequences
   (excluding those related to agriculture). The database includes, among
   others, the geographical distribution of the recorded events, relevant
   meteorological data, a brief description of the induced impacts and
   references in the press. This paper further offers an extensive analysis
   of the temporal and spatial distribution of high-impact weather events
   for the period 2001-2011, taking into account the intensity of weather
   conditions and the consequent impact on the society. Analysis of the
   monthly distribution of high-impact weather events showed that they are
   more frequent during October and November. More than 80 people lost
   their lives, half of which due to flash floods. In what concerns the
   spatial distribution of high-impact weather events, among the 51
   prefectures of the country, Attica, Thessaloniki, Elia and Halkidiki
   were the most frequently affected areas, mainly by flash floods.
   Significant was also the share of tornados in Elia, of windstorms in
   Attica, of lightning and hail events in Halkidiki and of snow/frost
   events in Thessaloniki.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In mid-July 2010 flash flooding in Pakistan destroyed the
   basic water, environmental sanitation and livelihood infrastructures in
   82 districts. Two months later, the local press of Swat (northern
   Pakistan) reported that several residents of Marghazar town became ill
   and were hospitalized after drinking contaminated water. A
   non-governmental organization (Oxfam GB) team took action to determine
   the causes of this incident and analyzed the community drinking water
   supply.
   Methods: Standard methods were used to analyze six physio-chemical and
   four microbiological water quality parameters at five selected sampling
   locations in the water supply system.
   Results: The samples from sites numbers (SN) 02, 03, 04 and 05 were
   found to be microbiologically unfit for drinking due to the presence of
   Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus (range
   18-96 +/- 14 cfu/100 mL). However, the pH, conductivity, total dissolved
   solid, total hardness as calcium carbonate and nitrate as NO3-2 of all
   the samples were within WHO permissible limits. Higher turbidities were
   recorded at SN04 and 05 of 6 +/- 0.23 and 9 +/- 1.23, respectively.
   Conclusion: Quantitative results revealed the presence of pathogenic
   organisms and water quality risk factors due to the damaged water and
   environmental sanitation infrastructure. Continued water quality
   monitoring, the application of household based disinfectants, and
   healthy domestic hygiene practices are highly recommended in similar
   circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{The NW Mediterranean region experiences every year heavy rainfall and
   flash floods that occasionally produce catastrophic damages. Less
   frequent are floods that affect large regions. Although a large number
   of databases devoted exclusively to floods or considering all kind of
   natural hazards do exist, usually they only record catastrophic flood
   events. This paper deals with the new flood database that is being
   developed within the framework of HYMEX project. Results are focused on
   four regions representative of the NW sector of Mediterranean Europe:
   Catalonia, Spain; the Balearic Islands, Spain; Calabria, Italy; and
   Languedoc-Roussillon, Midi-Pyrenees and PACA, France. The common
   available 30-yr period starts in 1981 and ends in 2010. The paper shows
   the database structure and criteria, the comparison with other flood
   databases, some statistics on spatial and temporal distribution, and an
   identification of the most important events. The paper also provides a
   table that includes the date and affected region of all the catastrophic
   events identified in the regions of study, in order to make this
   information available for all audiences.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{1469-1479}},
Abstract = {{This article considers the socio-geographical approach carried out as
   part of the MedUp program. It presents a study of the ways that the
   French ``actors{''} manage forecast uncertainties during a flash flood
   warning process. In order to better understand the role of forecasts'
   uncertainties in decision making, we focused on the actions people took
   and how what they say explains their actions. The practices of actors
   involved in warnings for the Vidourle watershed (Gard, France), in
   particular, are analyzed using a practice-based approach. A set of
   categories of the ``actors{''} was developed based on their descriptions
   of the problems they faced during the flash flood warning, independent

Abstract = {{Despite flash flooding being one of the most deadly and costly
   weather-related natural hazards worldwide, individual datasets to
   characterize them in the United States are hampered by limited
   documentation and can be difficult to access. This study is the first of
   its kind to assemble, reprocess, describe, and disseminate a
   georeferenced U.S. database providing a long-term, detailed
   characterization of flash flooding in terms of spatiotemporal behavior
   and specificity of impacts. The database is composed of three primary
   sources: 1) the entire archive of automated discharge observations from
   the U.S. Geological Survey that has been reprocessed to describe
   individual flooding events, 2) flash-flooding reports collected by the
   National Weather Service from 2006 to the present, and 3) witness
   reports obtained directly from the public in the Severe Hazards Analysis
   and Verification Experiment during the summers 2008-10. Each
   observational data source has limitations; a major asset of the unified
   flash flood database is its collation of relevant information from a
   variety of sources that is now readily available to the community in
   common formats. It is anticipated that this database will be used for
   many diverse purposes, such as evaluating tools to predict flash
   flooding, characterizing seasonal and regional trends, and improving
   understanding of dominant flood-producing processes. We envision the
   initiation of this community database effort will attract and encompass
   future datasets.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution presents the database on floods (1981-2010) that is
   being developed in the framework of HYMEX project and the preliminary
   results obtained for the NW sector of Mediterranean region. This
   database contains data on damages and the main hydrometeorological
   features of each reported event. The study is included in one of the
   objectives of the Working Group 5, which is a transversal group of the
   HYMEX project dealing with all the aspects related to societal and
   ecological impacts of hydrometeorological extremes, as well as their
   perception and communication processes. One of the main points of the
   WG5 is the creation of a common database on floods and their societal
   impact, for the Mediterranean region, as well as its analysis. Although
   some databases already exist and are frequently consulted, they are
   mainly focused on ``major{''} catastrophic events. But the Mediterranean
   region experiences every year a high number of minor flash-floods that,
   considered in their totality, produce important losses and disruptions
   of the everyday life. This contribution is focused on North-Eastern
   Spain, South of Italy and South-East of France and the objective is to
   include all the floods that have produced damages, although they are not
   considered as ``major{''} disasters.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Heavy rainfall in northern India in August 2010 caused flash
   floods, seriously damaging homes and infrastructure. There have been no
   major disasters in the history of Ladakh, and no surveys on
   post-disaster psychiatric disorders have been conducted in this area.
   Aims and methods: To examine the impact of this disaster in Ladakh one
   month post-disaster, we visited Choglamsar, located near the town of
   Leh, where the flood had the most severe impact. In total, 318 survivors
   (mean age: 58.6 years; female-male ratio: 59.7\%; Tibetan refugees:
   86.2\%) participated in the survey. We used the two-item Patient Health
   Questionnaire (PHQ-2) along with questions covering background
   characteristics and disaster exposure. A psychiatrist interviewed the
   survivors with a single or double positive score in the PHQ-2 or with
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
   Results and conclusion: There were only two PTSD cases and five of major
   depressive disorders. PTSD and depression were less common in the
   Tibetan cultural areas than in other areas. The social background and
   temperamental characteristics of the Tibetan culture may play a
   suppressive role in psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The 2010-2011 Queensland floods resulted in the most deaths
   from a single flood event in Australia since 1916. This article analyses
   the information on these deaths for comparison with those from previous
   floods in modern Australia in an attempt to identify factors that have
   contributed to those deaths. Haddon's Matrix, originally designed for
   prevention of road trauma, offers a framework for understanding the
   interplay between contributing factors and helps facilitate a clearer
   understanding of the varied strategies required to ensure people's
   safety for particular flood types.
   Methods: Public reports and flood relevant literature were searched
   using key words `flood', `fatality', `mortality', `death', `injury' and
   `victim' through Google Scholar, PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO. Data
   relating to reported deaths during the 2010-2011 Queensland floods, and
   relevant data of previous Australian flood fatality (1997-2009) were
   collected from these available sources. These sources were also used to
   identify contributing factors.
   Results: There were 33 deaths directly attributed to the event, of which
   54.5\% were swept away in a flash flood on 10 January 2011. A further
   15.1\% of fatalities were caused by inappropriate behaviours. This is
   different to floods in modern Australia where over 90\% of deaths are
   related to the choices made by individuals. There is no single reason
   why people drown in floods, but rather a complex interplay of factors.
   Conclusions: The present study and its integration of research findings
   and conceptual frameworks might assist governments and communities to
   develop policies and strategies to prevent flood injury and fatalities.}},

Abstract = {{Asi Ganga, a tributary of Bhagirathi river located upstream of
   Uttarkashi township witnessed a massive flash flood on the night of 3
   August 2012 due to cloudburst that occurred at the Pandrasu ridge that
   serve as a water divide between the Yamuna and Bhagirathi rivers. The
   flash flood claimed the lives of 35 human beings and 436 livestock, and
   affected about 12,000 people, damaging property worth about Rs 612
   crore. It has been observed that most of the damages in the area is
   related to the physiographic disposition of the Quaternary deposits
   lying along the valley slopes. The continued and recurring flash floods
   in the Himalaya call for a Disaster Management Policy that needs to be
   undertaken in the Himalayan terrain. The present study lays the
   foundation for further work to link/map the Quaternary deposits lying
   loose on both sides of the river vis-a-vis any developmental activity in
   the Himalayan terrain.}},

Pages = {{229-242}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the gaps in knowledge
   about how people get information in a flood and what they want to know.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 27 people were interviewed from
   two communities that suffered flooding in the 12 months before the
   interviews. Slow-moving flood and flash flood were covered.
   Findings - The type of disaster determines how people seek information.
   In slow-moving flood, people heard from others, tracked it visually and
   via web-available river gauge information, and talked to others with
   more flood experience. Radio was an important confirmation tool in the
   slow-moving flood. In flash flood, people first heard from others and
   then turned to television.
   Research limitations/implications Participants made up a small sample
   skewed toward regional areas and were selected by snowball/convenience
   sampling methods. A survey is required to confirm or refute findings.
   Practical implications - Word of mouth needs to be tapped into by
   agencies, and mobile phone networks and social media are critical to
   this. Radio and television should be more proactively used by emergency
   agencies and maps should be a feature of all flood communication.
   Originality/value - The focus of disaster communication research tends
   to have been on agency use of communication rather than the individual's
   use of a range of communication channels. This study encourages agencies
   to look at how individuals look for information, the channels they use
   to get information and the type of information they seek.}},

Abstract = {{The European ``Floods Directive{''} 2007/60/EU has produced an important
   shift from a traditional approach to flood risk management centred only
   on hazard analysis and forecast to a newer one which encompasses other
   aspects relevant to decision-making and which reflect recent research
   advances in both hydraulic engineering and social studies on disaster
   risk. This paper accordingly proposes a way of modelling the benefits of
   flood emergency management interventions calculating the possible
   damages by taking into account exposure, vulnerability, and expected
   damage reduction. The results of this model can be used to inform
   decisions and choices for the implementation of flood emergency
   management measures. A central role is played by expected damages, which
   are the direct and indirect consequence of the occurrence of floods in
   exposed and vulnerable urban systems. How damages should be defined and
   measured is a key question that this paper tries to address. The Floods
   Directive suggests that mitigation measures taken to reduce flood impact
   need to be evaluated also by means of a cost benefit analysis. The paper
   presents a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of early warning
   for flash floods, considering its potential impact in reducing direct
   physical damage, and it assesses the general benefit in regard to other
   types of damages and losses compared with the emergency management
   costs. The methodology is applied to the case study area of the city of
   Sondrio in the northern Alpine region of Italy. A critical discussion
   follows the application. Its purpose is to highlight the strengths and
   weaknesses of available models for quantifying direct physical damage
   and of the general model proposed, given the current state of the art in
   damage and loss assessment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the spatial coexistence between different hazards
   (strong west winds, beach sedimentary crisis and flash floods) in
   outlets of small catchments in a sedimentary basin. This study was
   carried out in the department of Upper Normandy located in north-western
   France. To anticipate possible future hazards and damages without
   depending on meteorological triggers (neither intense rainfall nor
   synoptic conditions), we combine previous knowledge accumulated on local
   phenomena to highlight the pre-conditioning factors and identify those
   areas characterised by the highest susceptibility to risk due to the
   accumulation of numerous hazards. This approach enables both space and
   time distribution patterns of natural hazards to be revealed. In space,
   the risk susceptibility strongly depends on morphology. Populations
   located at the outlet of large wet valleys, at the final outlets of
   small basins at a short distance from the plateaus and on the coastal
   fringe appear to be the most endangered. Even if hazards never occur at
   the same time, these areas can be affected by different hazards during
   one year (summer flash floods, floods, winter storm surges). This study
   identifies 14 sensitive areas along hollow shapes of the study area.
   Finally, our methodological investigations question the creation of a
   warning system combining mainland and marine hazards in these 14
   outlets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the hydrological and meteorological extremes that
   may be deduced from the taxation records of the estates of Brtnice,
   Trebic and Velke Mezirici, all in the Moravian-Bohemian Highlands of the
   Czech Republic, for the years 1706-1849. At that time, damage to
   agricultural crops constituted grounds for tax remission for individual
   farmers and landowners. Where it survives, the relevant administrative
   documentation generally includes a statement from the applicant, a
   report by the official commission tasked with checking the contents of
   it, and any decisions made by taxation authorities at regional and
   ``land{''} level (the Jihlava regional office and the Moravian Land
   Administration ({''}Gubernium{''}) respectively). Data extracted may
   include the type of event, dating, places of occurrence and damage done.
   The chronology of hydrological and meteorological extremes (torrential
   rain, flash flood, flood, hailstorm, lightning, frost) covers the period
   1706-1849, but only four events are evident before 1748 and there is a
   gap in records between 1757 and 1789. Extremes are analysed from a
   spatio-temporal point of view. A total of 97 extreme events (171
   extremes of particular type) were identified for the region studied.
   Torrential rain, hailstorm and flash flood were the major devastating
   phenomena, and occurred mainly from May to August. Torrential rain and
   hailstorm are clearly attributable to thunderstorms with very intense
   convection. Five outstanding events and their impacts upon individual
   farmers are described in detail. The results are discussed with respect
   to uncertainties in the basic data and in the context of the Czech
   Lands, because only some of the extremes disclosed are known and
   confirmed by other documentary data.}},

Abstract = {{Uncontrolled stormwater runoff not only creates drainage problems and
   flash floods but also presents a considerable threat to water quality
   and the environment. These problems can, to a large extent, be reduced
   by a type of stormwater management approach employing permeable pavement
   systems (PPS) in urban, industrial and commercial areas, where frequent
   problems are caused by intense undrained stormwater. PPS could be an
   efficient solution for sustainable drainage systems, and control water
   security as well as renewable energy in certain cases. Considerable
   research has been conducted on the function of PPS and their improvement
   to ensure sustainable drainage systems and water quality. This paper
   presents a review of the use of permeable pavement for different
   purposes. The paper focuses on drainage systems and stormwater runoff
   quality from roads, driveways, rooftops and parking lots. PPS are very
   effective for stormwater management and water reuse. Moreover,
   geotextiles provide additional facilities to reduce the pollutants from
   infiltrate runoff into the ground, creating a suitable environment for
   the biodegradation process. Furthermore, recently, ground source heat
   pumps and PPS have been found to be an excellent combination for
   sustainable renewable energy. In addition, this study has identified
   several gaps in the present state of knowledge on PPS and indicates some
   research needs for future consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Summer rainstorms frequently cause flash flooding in northern areas of
   Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. After decades of problems the city's water
   authority has finally planned a coordinated series of works to mitigate
   the hazard once and for all. One of the most critical areas is in the
   Mangue district, home to the Maracana stadium, which is drained by five
   rivers. This paper describes the planning, design and management of a
   variety of flood control works currently under construction. Valued at
   around 300 pound million, these include five new deep detention
   reservoirs, enlargement of existing 1.8 km long culverts and
   construction of a 2.4 km long river diversion tunnel. All river flows
   are also now monitored by the city's new operation and control centre.}},

Title = {{Reforesting severely degraded grassland in the Lesser Himalaya of Nepal:
   Effects on soil hydraulic conductivity and overland flow production}},

Abstract = {{Severely degraded hillslopes in the Lesser Himalaya challenge local
   communities as a result of the frequent occurrence of overland flow and
   erosion during the rainy season and water shortages during the dry
   season. Reforestation is often perceived as an effective way of
   restoring predisturbance hydrological conditions but heavy usage of
   reforested land in the region has been shown to hamper full recovery of
   soil hydraulic properties. This paper investigates the effect of
   reforestation and forest usage on field-saturated soil hydraulic
   conductivities (K-fs) near Dhulikhel, Central Nepal, by comparing
   degraded pasture, a footpath within the pasture, a 25 year old pine
   reforestation, and little disturbed natural forest. The hillslope
   hydrological implications of changes in K-fs with land-cover change were
   assessed via comparisons with measured rainfall intensities over
   different durations. High surface and near-surface K-fs in natural
   forest (82-232mmh(-1)) rule out overland flow occurrence and favor
   vertical percolation. Conversely, corresponding K-fs for degraded
   pasture (18-39mmh(-1)) and footpath (12-26mmh(-1)) were conducive to
   overland flow generation during medium- to high-intensity storms and
   thus to local flash flooding. Pertinently, surface and near-surface K-fs
   in the heavily used pine forest remained similar to those for degraded
   pasture. Estimated monsoonal overland flow totals for degraded pasture,
   pine forest, and natural forest were 21.3\%, 15.5\%, and 2.5\% of
   incident rainfall, respectively, reflecting the relative ranking of
   surface K-fs. Along with high water use by the pines, this lack of
   recovery of soil hydraulic properties under pine reforestation is shown
   to be a critical factor in the regionally observed decline in base flows
   following large-scale planting of pines and has important implications
   for regional forest management.}},

Abstract = {{We report findings from a mixed method study of women's gendered
   experiences with flash floods in the coastal city of Lagos, Nigeria.
   Drawing on narrative accounts from 36 interviews, a survey (n = 453) and
   6 focus group discussions, we investigate the impacts of floods in
   general and specifically the July 2011 flood event on women's lives,
   livelihoods, and health. We draw on complementary perspectives from
   feminist political ecology and social vulnerability theory to understand
   the ways in which such events are perceived, experienced and managed by
   women of different socio-economic classes, households, and geographic
   locations. Thematic and content analyses were used to examine women's
   perceptions of floods, while descriptive statistical analysis and
   chi-square test were employed to compare actual impacts. Results show
   that women in general expressed no concern about gendered vulnerability
   to flooding as most believed flood impacts were gender neutral. This
   dominant view however, was not supported by evidence in the post-July
   2011 flooding as impacts varied among income groups and neighbourhoods,
   and gender differences were apparent. Women in the low-income
   neighbourhood recorded higher impacts and slower recovery compared to
   other social categories of women and men. All impacts reported were
   statistically significant between women in low and high income
   neighbourhoods but most were not significant between women in middle and
   high income neighbourhoods. Gender relations and roles intersecting with
   place, class, employment status, and healthcare, were mediating factors
   that placed low-income women at greater risk of impacts than others.
   With climate change likely to induce more extreme events, a case is made
   for collaborative and institutional efforts to systematically boost
   urban poor women's adaptive capacity through targeted programmes aimed
   at alleviating poverty and improving women's access to housing, health
   care and alternative sources of livelihoods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Identifying the risk factors for morbidity and mortality effects pre-,
   during and post-flood may aid the appropriate targeting of flood-related
   adverse health prevention strategies. We conducted a systematic PubMed
   search to identify studies examining risk factors for health effects of
   precipitation-related floods, among Organisation for Economic
   Co-Operation and Development (OECD) member countries. Research
   identifying flood-related morbidity and mortality risk factors is
   limited and primarily examines demographic characteristics such as age
   and gender. During floods, females, elderly and children appear to be at
   greater risk of psychological and physical health effects, while males
   between 10 to 29 years may be at greater risk of mortality. Post-flood,
   those over 65 years and males are at increased risk of physical health
   effects, while females appear at greater risk of psychological health
   effects. Other risk factors include previous flood experiences, greater
   flood depth or flood trauma, existing illnesses, medication
   interruption, and low education or socio-economic status. Tailoring
   messages to high-risk groups may increase their effectiveness. Target
   populations differ for morbidity and mortality effects, and differ pre-,
   during, and post-flood. Additional research is required to identify the
   risk factors associated with pre- and post-flood mortality and
   post-flood morbidity, preferably using prospective cohort studies.}},

Abstract = {{U.S. government officials are focusing their attention on how to deliver
   timely and effective warning information to the public, especially given
   the devastating weather-related events that have occurred in recent
   years. With the increase of cell phones (and in particular, web-capable
   smartphones), weather warnings sent through various cellular
   technologies represent one way for officials to quickly notify an
   increasingly mobile public. Cellular technology innovations also make it
   possible for officials to broadcast information-rich media like graphics
   to cell phones. Whether warning messages must include such ``rich''
   media to be effective remains an open question. The current study
   investigates the effectiveness of National Weather Service (NWS) warning
   messages sent either in plain text or in text that includes a radar
   image of the storm. The research protocol was modeled after the
   interactive National Weather Service (iNWS) messaging service currently
   available to NWS core partners. In the study, participants read
   full-text NWS warnings of tornadoes or flash floods that either did or
   did not include a radar image of the storm. The researchers timed
   participants' ability to decide if a critical town was in the warning
   area, and then probed their understanding of the message content.
   Results show that participants' decision times to the town question did
   not differ between the graphic and no-graphic conditions. None of the
   other message content measures differed as a function of message
   condition. The results have potential implications for the federal
   government's new Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system, which, as yet,
   is limited to text-only warnings.}},

Abstract = {{Attention to climate-induced migration has grown considerably in recent
   years, reinforced by high frequency of droughts, storms and flooding.
   Focusing on migrations induced by flash floods in Zhouqu and droughts in
   central Ningxia, China this study illustrates key factors in the process
   of policy options to support climate-induced migration. The study is
   based on stakeholder interviews and secondary data processing. The
   findings show that integrating sudden and slow-onset hazards, combining
   top-down and bottom-up methodology and encouraging private sectors to
   establish Public-Private Partnership, are the main policy options from
   disaster relief perspective. Otherwise, two prospective transformations
   are proposed in policy options, transferring from re-active migration to
   pro-active migration, and from move \& stay to hope \& development in
   the aspect of migrants' livelihood improvement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes and illustrates a methodology to conduct postflood
   investigations based on interdisciplinary collaboration between social
   and physical scientists. The method, designed to explore the link
   between crisis behavioral response and hydrometeorological dynamics,
   aims at understanding the spatial and temporal capacities and
   constraints on human behaviors in fast-evolving hydrometeorological
   conditions. It builds on methods coming from both geosciences and
   transportations studies to complement existing postflood field
   investigation methodology used by hydrometeorologists. The authors
   propose an interview framework, structured around a chronological
   guideline to allow people who experienced the flood firsthand to tell
   the stories of the circumstances in which their activities were affected
   during the flash flood.This paper applies the data collection method to
   the case of the 15 June 2010 flash flood event that killed 26 people in
   the Draguignan area (Var, France). As a first step, based on the
   collected narratives, an abductive approach allowed the identification
   of the possible factors influencing individual responses to flash
   floods. As a second step, behavioral responses were classified into
   categories of activities based on the respondents' narratives. Then,
   aspatial and temporal analysis of the sequences made of the categories
   of action to contextualize the set of coping responses with respect to
   local hydrometeorological conditions is proposed. During this event, the
   respondents mostly follow the pace of change in their local
   environmental conditions as the flash flood occurs, official flood
   anticipation being rather limited and based on a large-scale weather
   watch. Therefore, contextual factors appear as strongly influencing the
   individual's ability to cope with the event in such a situation.}},

Title = {{Overview of the first HyMeX Special Observation Period over Italy:
   observations and model results}},

Pages = {{1953-1977}},
Abstract = {{The Special Observation Period (SOP1), part of the HyMeX campaign
   (Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean Experiments, 5 September-6
   November 2012), was dedicated to heavy precipitation events and flash
   floods in the western Mediterranean, and three Italian
   hydro-meteorological monitoring sites were identified: Liguria-Tuscany,
   northeastern Italy and central Italy. The extraordinary deployment of
   advanced instrumentation, including instrumented aircrafts, and the use
   of several different operational weather forecast models, including
   hydrological models and marine models, allowed an unprecedented
   monitoring and analysis of high-impact weather events around the Italian
   hydro-meteorological sites. This activity has seen strong collaboration
   between the Italian scientific and operational communities. In this
   paper an overview of the Italian organization during SOP1 is provided,
   and selected Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs) are described. A
   significant event for each Italian target area is chosen for this
   analysis: IOP2 (12-13 September 2012) in northeastern Italy, IOP13
   (15-16 October 2012) in central Italy and IOP19 (3-5 November 2012) in
   Liguria and Tuscany. For each IOP the meteorological characteristics,
   together with special observations and weather forecasts, are analyzed
   with the aim of highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the forecast
   modeling systems, including the hydrological impacts. The usefulness of
   having different weather forecast operational chains characterized by
   different numerical weather prediction models and/or different model set
   up or initial conditions is finally shown for one of the events (IOP19).}},

Abstract = {{Recent and historic high-impact events have demonstrated the flood risks
   faced by exposed coastal areas. These risks will increase due to climate
   change and economic development. This requires a re-evaluation of
   coastal disaster risk reduction DRR strategies and prevention,
   mitigation and preparedness PMP measures. To this end, the UN Office for
   Disaster Risk Reduction formulated the Hyogo Framework for Action, and
   the EU has issued the Floods Directive. By their nature, neither is
   specific about the methods to be used to assess coastal risks,
   particularly those risks resulting from dune and structure overtopping,
   the non-stationarity of surge and flash flood events, and coastal
   morphodynamic response. This paper describes a set of open-source and
   open-access methods, tools and management approaches to fill this gap. A
   Coastal Risk Assessment Framework will assess coastal risk at a regional
   scale. Thus critical hotspots can be identified for which an
   impact-oriented Early Warning System/Decision Support System is
   developed. This can be applied in dual mode: as a forecast and warning
   system and as an ex-ante planning tool to evaluate the vulnerability.
   The tools are demonstrated on case study sites on a range of EU coasts
   with diverse geomorphic settings, land use, forcing, hazard types and
   socio-economic, cultural and environmental characteristics. Specific DRR
   plans will be developed for all sites. A management guide of PMP
   measures and management approaches is to be developed. The toolkit will
   benefit forecasting and civil protection agencies, coastal managers,
   local government, community members, NGOs, the general public and
   scientists.}},

Abstract = {{Torrential floods are the most destructive and most frequent natural
   disasters in Serbia with severe social, economic, cultural, and
   environmental consequences that deserve special attention. This paper
   presents a data-collection strategy and data analysis in terms of
   spatial and temporal characterization of the torrential flood phenomenon
   in Serbia for the last 99 years. Based on the available information
   obtained from various reliable sources, we registered 848 torrential
   flood events for 1915-2013. The registered number of deaths from
   torrential floods is over 133, including 24 people from 1991 to 2010.
   Monthly distribution of registered torrential floods indicates that the
   majority of floods occurred in Serbian territory in late spring (from
   May to the end of June) and the greatest number of torrential floods is
   registered in Southern Morava basin. This work resulted in creating a
   first inventory of torrential floods in Serbia and its analysis for the
   purpose of the spatial and temporal distribution and characterization of
   this phenomenon. The inventory on torrential floods will be integrated
   in future in a unique multi-user database on natural hazards in Serbia,
   and it should become a part of the European database of natural hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Dam-break floods have been of increasing concern to safety engineers and
   decision makers. The presence of complex terrain in inundation areas
   multiplies the simulation difficulty of flood routing. In previous
   studies, representing the flood routing parameters empirically does not
   reflect the characteristics of flood routing, which strongly influences
   the accurate assessment of the dam-break consequences. The basis for
   carrying out dangerous reservoir reinforcement is just engineering
   safety, without considering the actual situation of downstream areas. In
   this study, a comprehensive risk analysis of the dam-break flood was
   implemented based on the numerical simulation of flood routing. First,
   coupled with the volume of fluid method, a three-dimensional k-E >
   turbulence mathematical model was developed for flood routing in complex
   inundation areas. Then, based on the flow parameters obtained through
   computational fluid dynamics modeling, the attribute measure methodology
   was used for the evaluation of consequences combined with the
   calculation of the dam-break consequences (loss of life, economic loss,
   social and environmental influence). Furthermore, a methodology
   containing the combined weight method and the technique for order
   performance by similarity to ideal solution method was proposed for risk
   ranking of dangerous reservoirs due to its logical consideration of
   scalar values that simultaneously account for both the best and worst
   alternatives. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to provide
   information about the stability of risk ranking. The aforementioned
   model and methodology are applied to a case involving five reservoirs in
   the Haihe River Basin in China for Part II of this study.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the physical vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure
   to natural hazards is an essential step in risk assessment for large
   cities. We have interpreted high spatial resolution images, conducted
   field surveys, and utilized numerical simulations, in order to assess
   vulnerability across Arequipa, south Peru, close to the active El Misti
   volcano. The emphasis of this study was on flash floods and volcanic or
   non-volcanic hyperconcentrated flows, which recur on average every 3.5
   years across the city. We utilized a geographic information system to
   embed vulnerability and hazard maps as a step to calculate risk for
   buildings and bridges along the Rio Chili valley and two tributaries. A
   survey of similar to 1,000 buildings from 46 city blocks, different in
   age, construction materials, and land usage, provided architectural and
   structural characteristics. A similar survey of twenty bridges across
   the three valleys was based on structural, hydraulic, and strategic
   parameters. Interpretation of high spatial resolution (HSR) satellite
   images, which allows for quick identification of approximately 69 \% of
   the structural building types, effectively supplemented field data
   collection. Mapping vulnerability has led us to pinpoint strategic areas
   in case of future destructive floods or flows. Calculated vulnerability
   is high if we examine structural criteria alone. We further consider
   physical setting with the most vulnerable city blocks located on the
   lowermost terraces, perpendicular or oblique to the flow path.
   Statistical analysis conducted on 3,015 city blocks, considering nine
   criteria identified from HSR images, indicated that building-type
   heterogeneity and the shape of the city blocks, along with building and
   street network density, are the most discriminant parameters for
   assessing vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper shows an in-depth analysis of the evolution of floods
   and precipitation in Catalonia for the period 1981-2010. In order to
   have homogeneous information, and having in mind that not gauge data was
   available for all the events, neither for all the rivers and stream
   flows, daily press from a specific newspaper has been systematically
   analysed for this period. Furthermore a comparison with a longer period
   starting in 1900 has been done. 219 flood events (mainly flash flood
   events) have been identified for the period of 30 years (375 starting in
   1900), 79 of them were ordinary, 117 of them were extraordinary and 23
   of them were catastrophic, being autumn and summer the seasons with the
   maxima values. 19\% of the events caused a total of 110 casualties. 60\%
   of them died when they tried to cross the street or the stream. Factors
   like the evolution of precipitation, population density and other
   socio-economical aspects have been considered. The trend analysis shows
   an increase of 1 flood/decade that probably has been mainly due to
   inter-annual and intra-annual changes in population density and in
   land-use and land-cover. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The general objective of the international MEDiterranean EXperiment
   (MEDEX) was the better understanding and forecasting of cyclones that
   produce high impact weather in the Mediterranean. This paper reviews the
   motivation and foundation of MEDEX, the gestation, history and
   organisation of the project, as well as the main products and scientific
   achievements obtained from it. MEDEX obtained the approval of World
   Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and can be considered as framed within
   other WMO actions, such as the ALPine EXperiment (ALPEX), the
   Mediterranean Cyclones Study Project (MCP) and, to a certain extent, THe
   Observing System Research and Predictability EXperiment (THORPEX) and
   the HYdrological cycle in Mediterranean EXperiment (HyMeX). Through two
   phases (2000-2005 and 2006-2010), MEDEX has produced a specific
   database, with information about cyclones and severe or high impact
   weather events, several main reports and a specific data targeting
   system field campaign (DTS-MEDEX-2009). The scientific achievements are
   significant in fields like climatology, dynamical understanding of the
   physical processes and social impact of cyclones, as well as in aspects
   related to the location of sensitive zones for individual cases, the
   climatology of sensitivity zones and the improvement of the forecasts
   through innovative methods like mesoscale ensemble prediction systems.}},

   scientific MEDEX literature and very active participants in the MEDEX
   campaigns.; The organisational, technical and financial support given by
   EUMETNET-EUCOS to MEDEX has been very important, particularly for
   sensitivity studies and for running the MEDEX campaigns. From the
   management of EUCOS, James Caughey, Bruce Scott and Stefan Klink have
   provided special help to MEDEX. Most of the work on sensitivity studies
   has been undertaken or directed by Victor Homar, from the University of

Abstract = {{The critical importance of accurate mapping and assessment of natural
   hazards and risks is discussed, which hazards and risks relate not only
   to seismic events but also to floods and avalanches, and their
   consequences. Accurate mapping is crucial in the early warning process
   and there is evidence of considerable discrepancies in previous mapping
   efforts. These discrepancies can have major economic effects on, for
   example, investment potential and insurance factors. Thus, hazards must
   be more accurately defined and risk assessments must be based on
   multi-risk calculation methods.}},

   requiring control through engineering infrastructure. Such a command and
   control paradigm represents a marked transition from the way that
   monsoon flood regimes have been traditionally perceived across Asia.
   Rapid urbanization and climate change has imposed increasingly difficult
   flood management challenges as an extension of impermeable surfaces
   generates rapid runoff and flash flooding, while cities expand into
   flood-prone areas. Property and communities are placed at enhanced risk.
   Urbanization reallocates risk as channel and floodplain modification
   influences flood regimes, while demands for flood protection at certain
   locations can redistribute risk to other areas. An increasing concern
   about flood hazard across Asian cities questions whether conventional
   solutions reliant on structural intervention are sustainable. Such
   questioning is mirrored by an alternative paradigm of rehabilitation in
   integrated river basin management - a recognition that restoring and
   sustaining functional river ecosystems with high biodiversity is one of
   the greatest challenges facing society. Rehabilitation initiatives
   demand a new approach to river basin management which encourage
   interdisciplinary activity, particularly between engineers,
   hydrologists, geomorphologists and ecologists. The paper sets out some
   preliminary ideas from a research project investigating the potential
   for river rehabilitation as a central tenet of flood management, with a
   particular focus on Asian cities.}},

Abstract = {{An optimal evacuation route plan has to be established to overcome the
   problem of poor coordination and uneven distribution of vehicles before
   or during disaster. This article introduces the evacuation vehicle
   routing problem (EVRP) as a new variant to the vehicle routing problem
   (VRP). EVRP is a process of moving vehicles from a vehicle location to
   the potentially flooded area (PFA), and from PFA to relief center using
   a number of capacitated vehicles. This paper examines the application of
   a multi-valued discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) for routing
   of vehicles from vehicle location to PFA. A solution representation is
   adopted and modified from the solution of the shortest path problem
   (SPP) to accommodate this problem. Experimental results were tested
   based on the objective function of finding a minimum total travelling
   time using datasets from a flash flood evacuation operation. DPSO was
   found to yield better results than a genetic algorithm (GA).}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the processes of
   information sharing on the municipal level with the aim to restore
   normality after a disaster occurs. The emergency management on the
   highest - national - level is thoroughly described in the National
   Emergency Plan while the factors such as education, culture,
   communication, and volunteerism influencing to a significant extent the
   ``municipality level{''} are not managed and are organized ad hoc. On
   this lowest level, the representatives do not usually have the required
   managing skills and knowledge (they receive some education in this area
   but quite often they have no practical experience with large-scale
   leadership) which appears as problematic since they have to lead and
   coordinate numerous groups of citizens and volunteers. In this article
   the authors, via personal interviews with the municipality
   representatives, evaluate the critical factors of successful crises
   mitigation based on the experience of small towns with the emergency
   management implemented during the flash floods 2010 in the Liberec
   region. From historical events the critical success factors (CSF) could
   be achieved for emergency management.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic signatures are physical and human-induced characteristics or
   processes that identify comparable or unique features of estuaries along
   latitudinal gradients. In Mediterranean areas, the microtidal regime and
   the strong seasonal and inter-annual contrasts cause an alternation
   between relatively high runoff and arid conditions. Furthermore, the
   long history of human settlement also increases the complexity in the
   study of these estuarine systems. This study investigates these
   signatures of the estuaries located within the Mallorcan eastern coast,
   which are geomorphologically homogeneous because of a similar bedrock
   geology and Holocene history. A multi-method approach focused on the
   integration of geomorphometry, hydraulics, historical sources and
   statistics was used. We explore the role played by catchment
   morphometric parameters, severe flash flood events and human
   disturbances in controlling the geomorphology of 10 beach-barrier
   enclosed, fluvial incised lagoons. Most of the lagoons discharge into
   `calas', ranging in size from 1345 to 17,537 m(2) and their related
   catchments are representative of the Mediterranean hydrological systems.
   Multiple regression models illustrate that the size, slope and drainage
   network development of the catchments explain the variance in length
   (r(2) = 0.67), volume (r(2) = 0.49), area (r(2) = 0.64), circularity
   (r(2) = 0.72) and average width (r(2) = 0.81) of the lagoons. Depending
   on these catchment morphometric variables, the shape of the lagoons is
   also determined by the occurrence of catastrophic flash floods, which
   cause scouring and dredging, whereas the ordinary flood events and sea
   storms promote refilling and sedimentation. A historical analysis since
   1850 documented 18 flood events, 5 of which were catastrophic with
   destructive effects along the catchments and large morphological changes
   in coastal lagoons. High intensity rainfall (up to 200 mm in 2 h), the
   geomorphometry of the catchments and the massive construction of
   terraces and transverse walls are involved in the generation of
   catastrophic flood events. Additionally, the lagoons were altered
   considerably by human intervention for flood control and to allow for an
   increased amount of human activities within the surrounding areas,
   although the high recurrence of catastrophic flood events causes a
   persistent difficulty in the human battle to dominate these ecosystems.
   Therefore, the area occupied by lagoons increased between 1956 and the
   present time from 31,981 m(2) to 63,802 m(2) because of the high
   recurrence of catastrophic flood events. Furthermore, tourism demand and
   a social conservation consciousness have promoted restoration and
   preservation since the 1990s. This study has improved the
   geomorphological knowledge of small Mediterranean estuaries affected by
   human disturbances in the high-energy environment found in Mallorca. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, outcomes from an investigation of plausible climate
   futures over the next century, and the potential impacts on water
   services including water resource management and disaster risk
   reduction, such as flash flooding in Ekurhuleni (EMM), are presented.
   Four key aspects are examined: (i) the extent to which the frequency of
   extreme rainfall events may change in South Africa as a result of
   climate change; (ii) the identification of some of the implications of
   extreme rainfall events for local government (iii) the identification of
   some of the challenges communities most at risk of flooding as a result
   of extreme rainfall events face, finally, (iv) the opportunities for
   future co-production of design methods and approaches to reduce current
   and future climate risks in EMM and elsewhere. Climate modelling
   conducted for this research indicates that it is plausible for an
   increase in the number of extreme rainfall events to occur over central
   and eastern South Africa over the next century. Over EMM, for example,
   an increase in extreme rainfall events is likely to be accompanied by
   flash flooding and a range of deleterious impacts, if planning and
   maintenance of the water services infrastructure is not improved - a
   result that is likely to be valid for all large metropolitan
   municipalities in the country. The paper provides some lessons learnt
   when trying to include a climate risk reduction approach into the
   planning of urban development.}},

Title = {{A flash flood hazard assessment in dry valleys (northern France) by
   cellular automata modelling}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an application of a cellular automaton-based run-off
   model (RUICELLS) to a series of small dry valleys in the Seine-Maritime
   department, northern France, to better assess their susceptibility to
   flash flood. These muddy floods shortly follow high rainfall (50-100 mm
   in less than 6 h) and occur in very small areas (< 20 km(2)). A surge
   generally rushes down through the main valley just a few minutes after
   rains have peaked. Previous events (n = 69, in the period 1983-2005)
   have occasionally threatened human lives and have caused significant
   damage to property and infrastructure. Nonetheless, given the variation
   among the valleys and the infrequency of events, these floods have not
   been numerous enough to permit a statistical analysis. Instead, we
   numerically simulate the possible future flash floods using RUICELLS, a
   cellular automaton model driven by a set of three deterministic
   hydrological rules. Simulations have been conducted for 148 basins, each
   subject to 16 different rainfall scenarios (2.368 simulations in total)
   to (1) estimate the peak flow discharges (Q), the specific peak flows (Q
   (s) ), and the lag times (T) of the flash floods and (2) detect the
   critical rainfall intensities that would trigger warnings and increased
   vigilance. Our simulations indicate that the number of basins
   susceptible to flash flooding greatly increases with the higher rainfall
   intensity, the distribution of sensitive crops (sugar beet, corn, maize,
   and flax) and the basin morphology. Several small basins could also
   induce by convergence a bigger flood in the downstream humid valleys.
   The location of the highest simulated discharges is aligned with
   observed events, and this comparison provides an evaluation of the
   modelling performance and of the credibility of the results.}},

Abstract = {{Several different factors external to the natural hazard of flash
   flooding can contribute to the type and magnitude of their resulting
   damages. Human exposure, vulnerability, fatality and injury rates can be
   minimized by identifying and then mitigating the causative factors for
   human impacts. A database of flash flooding was used for statistical
   analysis of human impacts across the U.S. 21,549 flash flood events were
   analyzed during a 6-year period from October 2006 to 2012. Based on the
   information available in the database, physical parameters were
   introduced and then correlated to the reported human impacts.
   Probability density functions of the frequency of flash flood events and
   the PDF of occurrences weighted by the number of injuries and fatalities
   were used to describe the influence of each parameter.
   The factors that emerged as the most influential on human impacts are
   short flood durations, small catchment sizes in rural areas, vehicles,
   and nocturnal events with low visibility. Analyzing and correlating a
   diverse range of parameters to human impacts give us important insights
   into what contributes to fatalities and injuries and further raises
   questions on how to manage them. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Floods are the leading cause of fatalities connected with natural
   disasters in Texas. A combination of physiography and precipitation
   often result in extreme hydrologic conditions that cause floods in the
   state. This paper reviews flood-related fatalities in Texas between 1959
   and 2008. Information on flood-fatality victims and the flood-causing
   events was obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. The data
   collected included the date, time, location, and weather conditions and
   the gender and age of the flood victims. Comparison with other states
   reveals that the size of the population of Texas is a major factor in
   the increased number of fatalities. The data also suggest that driving
   or walking into floodwaters may be responsible for more than 93\% of
   flood fatalities in Texas. Although most high-fatality counties are
   located in the Texas ``Flash Flood Alley{''} that includes major urban
   centers, normalization of fatality data shows that the flood-fatality
   risk is actually higher in other areas of the state. The analysis also
   indicates that the annual flood-fatality rates are decreasing
   significantly. A combination of improved hydrometeorological
   forecasting, educational programs aimed at enhancing public awareness of
   flood risk and the seriousness of flood warnings, and timely and
   appropriate action by local emergency and safety authorities will help
   further reduce flood fatalities in Texas. (C) 2014 American Society of

Abstract = {{Cloudburst is one of the major natural disasters in Uttarakhand state of
   India and this brings flash floods, landslides and massive destruction
   of property and lives almost every year in the state. The present paper
   discusses about flood and landslides which occurred due to cloud burst
   and heavy downpour in between 14 to 17 June, 2013 in the state.
   Uttarakhand is very susceptible to landslides and almost three fourth of
   the total geographical area of the state comes under sever to high
   landslide risk zone. The catastrophe started with cloud burst near
   Rambara in Rudraprayag district and due to torrential and continuous
   rainfall, almost all the major rivers and especially the Mandakini and
   the Alaknanda swelled up. Overflowing water reservoirs of the region
   catalysed the severity of the event. About one tenth of the upper
   catchment area of Mandakini river swept away due to flood and landslide.
   This was the deadliest hazard in 80 years' history of the state which
   affected about 80,000 people. The paper reflects the nature's supremacy
   over human potentials and advocates the balanced man-nature
   relationship, especially in such terrains which are most fragile and
   critically balanced. It suggests the judicious use of Himalayan
   resources and use of environment friendly techniques in implementing the
   development plan for the region.}},

   of Grantham, Queensland (Australia), was inundated with a flash flood in
   which 12 of the town's 370 residents drowned. The overall damage bill in
   Queensland was AUD there exists 2.38 billion (USD there exists 2.4
   billion) with 35 deaths, and more than three-quarters of the state was
   declared a flood disaster zone. In this study, we focus on the unusual
   and even rare decision to relocate Grantham in March 2011. The Lockyer
   Valley Regional Council (LVRC) acquired a 377-hectare (932-acre) site to
   enable a voluntary swap of equivalent-sized lots. In addition, planning
   regulations were set aside to streamline the relocation of a portion of
   the town. We review the natural hazard literature as it relates to
   community relocation, state and local government documents related to
   Grantham, and reports and newspaper articles related to the flood. We
   also analyze data from interviews with key stakeholders. We document the
   process of community relocation, assess the relocation process in
   Grantham against best practice, examine whether the process of community
   relocation can be upscaled and if the Grantham relocation is an example
   of good planning or good politics.
   Takeaway for practice: Our study reveals two key messages for practice.
   Community relocation (albeit a small one) is possible, and the process
   can be done quickly; some Grantham residents moved into their new,
   relocated homes in December 2012, just 11 months after the flood.
   Moreover, the role of existing planning regulations can be a hindrance
   to quick action; political leadership, particularly at the local level,
   is key to implementing the relocation.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing concern in the United States over the `residual' flood
   risk behind leveed floodplains, which is commonly assessed based on
   one-dimensional (1D) river flow models. These models fail to capture the
   complex flow dynamics that typically characterise floodplain inundation.
   Here, we demonstrate methodologies for mechanistically simulating a
   levee breach and flow into a levee district along the Middle Mississippi
   River using a hybrid 1D/two-dimensional (1D2D) flow model that combines
   a 1D model of the river channel with a two-dimensional (2D)
   overland-flow model for the leveed floodplain. This 2D modelling
   documents the complexity of flow over a large and topographically
   diverse leveed floodplain, including distribution and timing of
   inundation as well as the resulting public-safety threats. In relation
   to safety threats, three distinct flood phases can be recognised: (1) a
   flash flood phase, (2) a flow redistribution phase and (3) an
   equilibrium phase. The flash flood phase presents imminent threats to
   human life and safety, whereas subsequent phases determine inundation
   areas and depths, and therefore infrastructure damages. 2D modelling of
   levee-breach flooding provides input data necessary for: (1) specific
   local evacuation and mitigation planning in the Metro East area, and (2)
   methodologies for analyses of residual risk facing other levee-protected
   floodplain areas.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an integrated methodology for sustainable
   development planning to conserve the excess water resources. This
   developed methodology takes advantage of geographic information systems
   software to integrate its strength to manage the flood impacts. This
   approach is of dual purpose: first, to reduce the flash flood hazard of
   hill torrents; and second, to make use of flood water as a source of
   irrigation by conserving flood water in an earthen reservoir. The
   developed integrated methodology works as a decision-making system for
   selection of best site selection for earthen reservoir. The results for
   three potential sites for earthen reservoir supports in a
   decision-making process for best site for reservoir by analysing
   calculations for storage capacity, earthen works, and lengths of canals
   from reservoirs to agricultural land. This study investigated that the
   tools of geoinformatics have the potential to resolve the engineering
   challenges linked with mitigation of flood hazards. It is evident from
   the study that practical considerations for future turn the study into
   an informational tool to mitigate flood.}},

Abstract = {{Warning is a key issue to reduce flash floods impacts. But, despite many
   studies, local and national authorities still struggle to issue good
   flash floods warnings. We will argue that this failure results from a
   classical approach of warnings, based on a strict separation between the
   assessment world and the action world. We will go further than the
   previous criticisms (Pielke and Carbone, 2002) and show that
   forecasters, decision makers, emergency services and local population
   have quite similar practices during a flash-flood warning. Focusing on
   the use of meteorological information in the warning process, our case
   study shows that more research about the real practices of stakeholders
   would be another step towards integrated studies.}},

Abstract = {{Disaster relief management is essential for various types of disasters
   such as terrorist attacks, hazardous materials, hurricanes and flash
   floods. Planning for disaster relief is important in rescuing victims
   with the involvement of many agencies and the public in managing the
   event. This is due to poor coordination, late assistance and uneven
   distribution of vehicles, food, and medical assistants. Time and cost
   are very important in disaster relief. The need for a proper disaster
   relief plan to overcome these issues is crucial. This paper presents a
   two tier solutions to relieve flood victims focuses on the evacuation.
   The first tier is to complete the task of vehicles assignment at the
   inundated area. Then, the routing of vehicles from inundated areas to
   relief centres. A discrete particle swarm optimization were employed and
   tested reflecting the fitness functions identified from each tier. The
   findings show that the two-tier solution provides good results for the
   evacuation plan.}},

Title = {{Assessing the influence of watershed characteristics on the flood
   vulnerability of Jhelum basin in Kashmir Himalaya}},

Abstract = {{In Himalayan region, it is very important to generate detailed terrain
   information for identifying the causes of natural hazards such as debris
   flows, debris floods, and flash floods, so that appropriate corrective
   measures are initiated for reducing the risk of the people and property
   to these disasters. Basic watershed morphometrics coupled with the
   land-cover and slope information are useful for assessing the hazard
   vulnerability. The terrain characteristics govern the surface hydrology
   and have profound influence on the incidence and magnitude of natural
   hazards, particularly floods. The present work is a comparative study of
   two watersheds of Jhelum basin (upper Indus basin in Kashmir). In this
   research, we make an integrated use of the Linear Imaging Self-Scanner
   satellite data and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
   Radiometer digital elevation model, supported with extensive field
   information, in a GIS environment for assessing the surface hydrological
   behavior of Lidder and Rembiara watersheds of the Jhelum basin.
   Knowledge-driven modelling approach has been used to evaluate the runoff
   potential of the watersheds to assess the flood vulnerability
   downstream. The results revealed that Lidder watershed exhibits lesser
   basin lag time compared to Rembiara watershed for a storm event.
   Further, due to higher population density in the Lidder downstream, this
   watershed is also socially more vulnerable to flooding than Rembiara.
   The methodology and results of this study shall help in formulating
   better flood mitigation strategies in this part of the Himalayan region,
   where the observation network of hydrometeorological and other land
   surface parameters is either missing or very scanty.}},

Abstract = {{In Kota, the third largest city of Rajasthan, poverty levels are high in
   many areas and there is a great need to assess the vulnerability and
   adaptive capacity of different societal groups and sectors to the
   impacts of climatic variability and change, and to formulate sustainable
   planning strategies. The city is a large rapidly growing centre (but not
   a megacity), facing a varied and challenging water situation and
   anticipated harmful effects of climate change. The methodological
   approach involves participatory workshops with key stakeholders in urban
   administration to identify vulnerabilities, and discuss concrete
   strategies for increasing the adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable
   areas and sectors. The paper focuses on water resource planning (storm,
   potable, and wastewater), since it is already a challenging societal
   issue and one which will become even more critical in the future with
   climate change. We aim to contribute to improved urban water management
   for sustainable climate change adaptation in developing countries
   through an improved methodology of vulnerability assessments, capacity
   building and social learning, and a deeper empirical understanding of an
   urban context in Central India.}},

Abstract = {{Various disasters in recent decades have confirmed that the risk from
   water-related events has been increasing significantly worldwide. Among
   those events are tsunamis, storm surges, river floods, flash floods,
   mass movements and droughts. The driving factors of this risk are the
   unabated increase in global population, the concentration of people in
   high-risk areas such as coasts, flood plains and hillsides, the rise in
   vulnerability of assets, infrastructure and social systems, and the
   consequences of environmental and climatic changes. Risk reduction
   requires general awareness at all levels of society and a partnership
   between the public sector, the people concerned and the insurance
   industry. Structural and nonstructural precautionary measures are always
   cheaper in the long run than paying losses. Overall economic
   consequences are significantly less severe in societies with a high
   insurance penetration.}},

Abstract = {{Flood protection is an integral part of society's development. Meeting a
   growing vulnerability in the context of geopolitical and global changes,
   existing systems of natural hazard management must be reviewed on a
   regular basis. This is illustrated well by Bavaria's recent history. The
   lessons from the big floods in the period of 1999-2013 led to a
   fundamental modification of Bavaria's integral flood protection
   strategy. The concepts of flood risk management, resilience and dealing
   with extreme flood events which exceed standard structural design limits
   came to the fore. Management of flash floods and other floods, handling
   of potential retention areas, the inclusion of insurance, resettlement,
   and the burden of maintenance are further challenges which are briefly
   addressed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Participatory responses to natural disasters are currently considered to
   be the primary tool for disaster risk reduction. However, the
   implementation of this tool in post-communist Central European countries
   is constrained by the strong position of the central government and a
   weakened civil society as a heritage of the former communist
   governments. This study analyses documentary sources to reconstruct
   social responses to five disastrous flash flood events (1897, 1907,
   1925, 1926 and 1927) in northern Bohemia, Czech Republic. The
   reconstruction of social responses has revealed their complexity and
   strong component of a participatory approach. The analysis shows that
   certain historical measures and approaches to recovery from flash floods
   can be useful for re-establishing and reinforcing former social patterns
   in post-communist transition countries in terms of strategies for
   disaster risk reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Six years after the devastating M-s 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake, new
   landslides, debris flows, and flash floods still occur frequently in the
   earthquake-stricken regions. This shows that the geological hazards that
   occur after a major earthquake in a mountainous environment can be a
   long-term threat. However, post-earthquake reconstruction and relocation
   of local residents often neglect this evolving threat, and its
   interaction with existing and rebuilt houses has not been well studied.
   Here we show that the evolving mountain environment, including the
   changed geographic distribution of new landslides and the continuously
   uplifting riverbed, creates emerging risks for existing and rebuilt
   houses. We use spatial analysis of landslide debris and the location of
   houses from high-resolution images and field survey in the study area
   and find that new landslides and the houses rebuilt after the Wenchuan
   earthquake have a similar trend of moving to lower elevations, gentler
   slopes, and closer to rivers. This study confirms that the persistent
   downward movement of landslide debris has rapidly filled up riverbeds
   over the past 6 years. The elevated riverbeds make the study area
   extremely susceptible to flash floods, creating further risks to newly
   rebuilt houses that are closer to the river. We highlight the often
   neglected dynamic process that involves changes in the natural
   environment and man-made constructions and their interaction. This
   dynamic process requires long-term monitoring and adaptive management of
   mountainous regions after major earthquakes that can fully consider the
   so-phisticated evolving risks caused by the changing environment,
   exposure, and vulnerability in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Recent destructive flood events and projected increases in flood risks
   as a result of climate change in many regions around the world
   demonstrate the importance of improving flood risk management.
   Flood-proofing of buildings is often advocated as an effective strategy
   for limiting damage caused by floods. However, few empirical studies
   have estimated the damage that can be avoided by implementing such flood
   damage mitigation measures. This study estimates potential damage
   savings and the cost-effectiveness of specific flood damage mitigation
   measures that were implemented by households during major flood events
   in France. For this purpose, data about flood damage experienced and
   household flood preparedness were collected using a survey of 885 French
   households in three flood-prone regions that face different flood
   hazards. Four main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First,
   using regression analysis results in improved estimates of the
   effectiveness of mitigation measures than methods used by earlier
   studies that compare mean damage suffered between households who have,
   and who have not, taken these measures. Second, this study has provided
   empirical insights showing that some mitigation measures can
   substantially reduce damage during floods. Third, the effectiveness of
   the mitigation measures is very regional dependent, which can be
   explained by the different characteristics of the flood hazard in our
   sample areas that experience either slow onset river flooding or more
   rapid flash and coastal flooding. Fourth, the cost-efficiency of the
   flood damage mitigation measures depends strongly on the flood
   probability faced by households. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The United Kingdom has experienced several exceptional summer flash
   floods in recent years and there is growing concern about the frequency
   of such events and the preparedness of the population. This paper uses a
   case study of the upper Ryedale flash flood (2005) and questionnaire and
   interview data to assess local perceptions of upland flash flooding.
   Experience of a major flash flood may not be associated with increased
   flood risk perception. Despite local residents' awareness of a trend
   towards wetter summers and more frequent heavy rainfall, the poor
   maintenance of rivers was more frequently thought to be a more
   significant factor influencing local flood risk than climate change.
   Such findings have important implications for the potential success of
   contemporary national flood policies, which have put greater emphasis on
   public responsibility for responding to flooding. This study recommends,
   therefore, the use of fresh participatory approaches to redistribute and
   raise awareness of locally-held flood knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Floods account for more than half of the global hydrometeorological
   risks. Severe floods cause significant economic shocks and loss of
   lives, particularly for developing countries such as Jamaica. There is
   need for more information on the present and projected flood risks to
   justify macro-scale planning for climate change adaptation and
   facilitate the decision-making processes. In this study, a catalogue of
   198 flood events occurring between 1678 and 2010 is compiled for Jamaica
   and used to examine the climatology, occurrence, trends, causes and
   duration of the island's severe events. The annual flood risk is
   estimated to be a loss of life rate of 4 persons and estimated annual
   damage of USD96.3 million per annum in 2010 values and approximately
   0.84 \% of GDP per annum. Macro-scale models for flood risks (deaths and
   damages) are also developed using data from the flood catalogue and
   maximum precipitation at the town and parish level. The models examine
   the relationship between flood risks (death and damages) and extreme
   rainfall depths and intensities. Future climate risks of loss of lives
   and damages are predicted to increase 11 and 9 \%, respectively, to 4.4
   persons and USD105.2 million per annum.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the analysis of flash floods triggered by an extreme
   rainfall event that occurred on 7 October, 2011, over the Marzano
   carbonate massif (Southern Apennines). The rainfall event reactivated
   alluvial fans built up at the outlet of two mountain basins. Detailed
   geological surveys carried out immediately after the event allowed the
   reconstruction of the main erosion and depositional processes that
   occurred both in the drainage basin and in the fan areas. The volume of
   materials eroded in the basin and deposited in the fan was evaluated by
   means of accurate topographic surveying and GPS measurements.
   Morphological and morphometric properties of the basin/fan system as
   well as the presence of human interventions and structures along the
   main channel and in the fan area influenced flow propagation. The
   transported materials came mainly from debris and gravels previously
   accumulated along the stream beds and mobilised by the flow during the
   event. No significant evidence of landslide contribution to transported
   bed load was detected. Extensive damage was done to buildings, river
   bank structures and agricultural crops. Despite the existence of
   hundreds of similar alluvial/fan systems in the Southern Apennines, few
   studies have been conducted to support adequate risk mitigation action
   in these areas. Indeed, to our knowledge, this is the first study
   focusing on assessing the magnitude of alluvial fan flooding in the
   context of the Southern Apennines. Studies like the present one may help
   determine the volumes involved during flash floods whilst providing
   support for detailed flood hazard zoning and for risk mitigation
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, flood is a recurrently occurring damaging phenomenon. In terms
   of flood related damages, approximately 90 \% is reported from the
   developing countries, where poverty is a major risk factor and holding
   low resilience. Pakistan has no exception to it, where flood is a
   frequently occurring adverse event. Pakistan is one of the flood prone
   countries in the world because of its physical and climatic
   characteristics. The Indus plain is occupied by more than 120 million
   population, where agriculture is a major source of livelihood earnings.
   Majority of them are poor section of the society and tenant cultivators.
   During the span of 67 years (1947-2013), on average of 4-year, a severe
   flood hit the country. The increasing population, degradation of
   ecological environment and the changing climate scenario have further
   multiplied the risk of flood disasters. It has been estimated that
   Pakistan is suffering from frequent flood disasters and so far 11,239
   human lives were lost, out which 1,985 is reported from the super-flood
   of 2010. It was a century worst flood, where 20 million people were
   affected and over 100,000 km 2 (1/5th of the country total area)
   inundated and approximate to US\$ 10 billion economic loss was
   registered. Since the inception of Pakistan 1947, efforts have been made
   for building resilience through various flood reduction approaches. The
   existing flood reduction strategies range from structural to
   non-structural measures. This chapter provides a review of risks
   associated with flash and river flooding in Pakistan. It also gives an
   analytical discussion on the historic flood events and their adverse
   impacts. In addition, the flood risk reduction approaches undertaken so
   far in Pakistan have also been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Lockyer Valley region in southeast Queensland. Australia experienced
   extreme flash flooding in January 2011 that resulted in the loss of 19
   lives including 12 in the township of Grantham. In order to reduce
   future risks, the Lockyer Valley Regional Council (LVRC) immediately
   committed to an innovative community resettlement project, despite an
   environment of political resistance and bureaucratic turmoil. From a
   local government perspective, this paper provides an overview and
   examination of the unique disaster recovery and resettlement process
   undertaken by the LVRC. A mixed methods approach was used to assess the
   resettlement project in terms of political, cultural, social and
   financial factors that act to sustain and improve people's lives and
   livelihoods. Methods included field observations, documentary analysis,
   focus group discussions and semistructured interviews with key LVRC
   officers. Integrating the interview data sets and a variety of source
   materials, this paper assesses the early-stage outcomes of the
   resettlement and recovery process in Grantham and discusses the
   challenges and issues identified in the process so far. The paper
   addresses the significance of collaboration between all sectors involved
   including community members; governments; and land-use planning and
   emergency management practitioners. This research highlights the
   importance of community participation and the need for ongoing
   assessments in the resettlement and recovery process. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The Himalaya has been venerated by communities since antiquity and hence
   visited by a large number of pilgrims for paying tribute, annually.
   Uttarakhand state in the Indian Himalaya being the place of major Hindu
   shrines like Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri and also the
   place of origin of many sacred rivers including the Ganges, at present,
   is best known for the religious tourism. Though, the state population is
   about 10 million, over 25 million tourists visited here in 2011 despite
   the fact that the state remains under frequent natural hazards in the
   forms of landslides, earthquakes and flash Roods mainly during monsoon.
   Recently, on 16 and 17 June 2013, the torrential downpour and subsequent
   flooding had wreaked havoc that not only swallowed vast swathes of
   Uttarakhand but also took life of thousands of pilgrims and tourists.
   The cloudburst, heavy rainfall and subsequent landslides are the natural
   disasters but this disaster in Uttarakhand is mainly attributed by
   masses as a man-made disaster due to unregulated tourism and unplanned
   construction. In this background, the major aim of this study is to
   explore and review the factors responsible for increased intensity and
   scale of disaster due to flash floods in the Uttarakhand state of India.
   The paper also reviews and discusses various options for disaster risk
   reductions in the sensitive ecosystem such as the Himalaya. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We have measured livelihoods vulnerability indices for four disaster
   prone zones in Bangladesh, namely saline, flood, flash flood and
   drought. A total of 2558 households were surveyed to collect data on
   socio-demographics, livelihoods, social networks, health, food and water
   security, natural disasters and climate variability. The data were
   aggregated using a composite index and vulnerabilities across the four
   disaster prone areas were compared. Our results show that the flash
   flood zone is the most vulnerable zone followed by the saline, drought
   and flood zones respectively. The flash flood zone is mainly a mono-rice
   crop area and local livelihood opportunities are uncertain and limited.
   Road infrastructure is poor as a large part of this zone remains under
   water in the wet season. Public health services are underprovided and
   the hospitals are understaffed, sanitary conditions are poor and the
   households suffer a longer period of food insecurity. The poor
   households living in the saline zone have to depend more on social
   networks and local authorities to withstand livelihood shocks brought
   about by natural disasters such as tidal surges, cyclones and increasing
   salinity. The drought and saline zones are highly vulnerable to water.
   Water in these zones is not only scarce but also unsafe for drinking.
   The saline zone also suffers from salinity in water used for irrigation
   which has already affected productivity of land. We suggest an increase
   in public spending on sanitation and drinking water, health and rural
   infrastructure particularly in the disaster prone areas where incidence
   of poverty is high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{According to the International Disaster Database (CRED 2009) frequency
   of extreme hydrological situations on a global scale is constantly
   increasing. The most typical example of a natural risk in Europe is
   flood there is a decrease in the number of victims, but a significant
   increase in economic damage. A decrease in the number of victims is
   caused by the application of current hydrological management that
   focuses its attention primarily on large rivers and elimination of the
   damages caused by major flood situations. The growing economic losses,
   however, are a manifestation of the increasing intensity of floods on
   small watercourses, which are usually not sufficiently taken into
   account by the management approaches. The research of small streams
   should focus both on the study of the watercourse itself, especially its
   ecomorphological properties, and in particular on the possibility of
   flood control measures and their effectiveness. An important part of
   society's access to sustainable development is also the evolution of
   knowledge about the river landscape area, which is perceived as a
   significant component of global environmental security and resilience,
   thanks to its high compensatory potential for mitigation of
   environmental change. The findings discussed under this contribution are
   based on data obtained during implementation of the project
   ``GeoRISK{''} (Geo-analysis of landscape level degradation and natural
   risks formation), which takes into account the above approaches applied
   in different case studies catchments of small streams in different parts
   of the Czech Republic. Our findings offer an opportunity for practical
   application of field research knowledge in decision making processes
   within the national level of current water management.}},

Abstract = {{Community participation is an increasing issue in risk and disaster
   management. This paper argues that interdisciplinary methods are
   necessary for mapping flooding areas. On the one hand, hazards can be
   quantified and mapped through deductive approaches and methods from the
   natural sciences. On the other hand, hazards can also be described from
   the population perspective at a local level using social sciences
   methods. The methods are successfully mixed with a geographical
   information system environment. In the first case, important inputs
   include topographic and slope data for geomorphological mapping. In the
   second case, timeline methodology can indicate temporally the most
   severe floods, and a participatory map construction gives the population
   the opportunity to point out the affected areas. These methods were
   applied in a case study in the lower Amazon River Region in the urban
   area of the Santar,m municipality. High-resolution images and remote
   sensing were essential tools. Results show that nine neighborhoods have
   high and moderate susceptibility areas to riverine floods. Another nine
   neighborhoods are affected by flash floods. Flood mapping is the first
   step in risk mapping for the sustainability of regional planning.}},

Abstract = {{Floods seem to be more and more a serious problem in the Czech Republic.
   Geographical occurrence of floods has become less predictable recently,
   since flash floods have the main role at the beginning of flood events.
   Flash flood has a bigger impact to our environment than ordinary floods,
   as municipalities are prepared in most cases for the ordinary ones. Land
   cover type is an important factor due to its influence on the
   precipitation water runoff for a decision what kind of crop is suitable
   for a given region. This choice can substantially affect the future
   impact of floods (e.g. corn is a crop which can negatively influence the
   area during the flash floods). The second problem is an expansion of
   crop to forest areas ( deforestation). This process has also a negative
   impact on influence of upcoming flash flood. The paper deals with
   assessment of land cover type with regard to its possible impacts on
   flash flood impacts when the main danger does not come from the river
   but from hillsides around urban areas and assessment of flood with
   regards to land cover changes. In this paper, the available remote
   sensing data will be analyzed for this task as well as the analysis of
   available technology which can be used in areas where the data from
   remote sensing cannot be used in the required time frame or quality -
   for example which kind of data from field surveying will be needed or if
   there is an opportunity for using UAV. The paper will serve as a basic
   source for future analyses where individual issues will be analyzed. (C)

Abstract = {{A conceptual flash flood early warning system for developing countries
   is described. The system uses rainfall intensity data from terrestrial
   microwave communication links and the geostationary Meteosat Second
   Generation satellite, i.e., two systems that are already in place and
   operational. Flash flood early warnings are based on a combination of
   the Flash Flood Guidance method and a hydrological model. The system
   will be maintained and operated through a public-private partnership,
   which includes a mobile telephone operator, a national meteorological
   service and an emergency relief service. The mobile telephone operator
   acts as both the supplier of raw input data and the disseminator of
   early warnings. The early warning system could significantly reduce the
   number of fatalities due to flash floods, improve the efficiency of
   disaster risk reduction efforts and play an important role in
   strengthening the resilience to climate change of developing countries
   in Africa. This paper describes the system that is currently being
   developed for Kenya.}},

Abstract = {{The East Siang District represents one of the multi-hazard prone
   districts of Arunachal Pradesh, India covering an area of approximately
   4,005 km(2) drained by the mighty transboundary river Siang. It is
   located in the foothills of the Himalaya and shows wide variation in
   lithology and topography. Pasighat census town, established in the year
   1911, is the headquarter of the district which falls in zone III of the
   seismic hazard zonation map of North-Eastern region of India, and can
   experience peak ground acceleration of the order of 200-250 cm/s(2).
   Flash floods, landslide dam outburst floods (LDOFs) are the major
   geohazards in the district that causes heavy destruction of life and
   property. Other geohazards include landslides, hailstorm and forest fire
   spread across the year. The LDOF in Tibet on 11 June 2000 caused death
   of many people living in the downstream areas of the East Siang
   district. It also affected more than 10,000 people, submergence of
   villages and standing crops, and collapse of bridges in Arunachal
   Pradesh and Assam. The occurrences of flash floods have risen in the
   past decade causing partial damage to the township of Pasighat. A large
   numbers of rural link roads, culverts, suspension bridges and wooden
   bridges have been collapsed due to landslides, flash floods and LDOF
   time to time. In view of the fact that, Siang is trans-boundary river,
   temporal coverage in real time and at frequent intervals is ` thus'
   required for continuous monitoring of behavior of the river in relation
   to incessant rains, cloudbursts and on-going neotectonic activity. A
   geoethical approach is needed in establishment of integrated flood
   mitigation strategies by effectively using adequate technologies and
   sharing of scientific knowledge at trans-boundary levels.}},

Abstract = {{In October 2010 a rainstorm hit some municipalities in Liguria (NW
   Italy) resulting in flash floods and debris floods. Rescue operations
   were carried out without situational awareness due to phone and cellular
   line failure and civil protection plan deficiency. Relief operations
   were carried out to recover to previous state with no lesson learned
   analysis nor legislative upgrade. A window of opportunity opened to
   fulfill the disaster management cycle theory. On October/November 2011,
   when a wider event struck both Tuscany and Liguria regions causing 12
   fatalities, the situation was, more or less, the same as the past year:
   the window of opportunity closed without a reduction in risk exposure.
   After this last event Ligurian Region administration started to re-
   evaluate hazard mapping and risk assessment methodologies, since debris
   floods were not considered in official hazard maps and urban planning
   regulations. But a month later, the temporary building restrictions were
   reformed to low strict level. Different to Northwest Italy extensive
   floods of 1994, that led Italy to a new approach to hazard planning and
   risk evaluation, Liguria 2010/2011 events did not to seemingly involve,
   bureaucracy and civil society on the new resilience concept and on the
   use of the emerging technologies and social media.}},

Abstract = {{The role of social resilience and local-based adaptation strategies as
   efficient tools for natural risk reduction has been increasingly
   emphasised over the last decades. Many authors have noted that learning
   from historical disasters is a background process contributing to social
   resilience. In this study, three case studies examining multiple natural
   hazards, catastrophic landslides and flash floods in the study area of
   Northern Czechia are presented. The study of documentary data enabled us
   to reconstruct the social impacts of these hazards and the historical
   responses of communities to these impacts. Our results indicate that
   communities were frequently affected by various natural hazards and
   developed specific mitigation and recovery measures that might inspire
   present-day risk reduction strategies.}},

Title = {{Flood induced vulnerability in strategic plan making process of Riyadh
   city}},
Journal = {{HABITAT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{375-385}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, is undergoing a critical transition
   when the conventionally thought desert climate has been witnessing
   `turning-to-be-regular' flash floods. Since 2009, the city has been
   repeatedly hit by flash floods that has put further adverse consequences
   on the properties and even resulting in death tolls. Such critical
   transition has made the think-tanks seriously re-think about the
   resilient capacity of the existing infrastructure. Although the city has
   been attempted to plan, develop and expand under a number of master
   planning regimes, the `emerging-recurrent' flash flood was not
   critically considered in the plan making process. However, the recent
   MEDSTAR comprehensive strategic development initiative has brought a new
   hope with re-conceptualizing the planning strategies in the plan making
   and revision processes. Thus, this study attempts to evaluate the
   credibility of master plans with an especial focus on MEDSTAR to find
   out the resilience power against flash flood driven adverse
   consequences. The evaluation is carried out with the lens of social and
   physical vulnerabilities of flash floods and associated risks of the
   proposed strategies for growth and land use of Riyadh until 2030. The
   evaluation suggests that many areas of Riyadh city, formally proposed
   with specific land uses, densification and expansion plan, are prone to
   both social and physical vulnerabilities of flood in the scale of `high'
   to `moderate' vulnerability induced risks. With the aid of composite
   flood vulnerability (social and physical) index, therefore, this study
   suggests MEDSTAR comprehensive development strategy to undergo another
   re-evaluation process that perhaps will strongly influence the current
   investment decision on infrastructure to make Riyadh resilient against
   the `emerging-recurrent' flash floods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{During the planning of urban environment, usually economic and social
   parameters are taken into consideration. As a result, urban planning
   areas are susceptible and vulnerable to different types of natural
   disasters, which cause extensive damages to these areas. In the current
   study, for the protection of the urban environment, a unique approach of
   urban planning and sustainable development is proposed. The study area
   is the Wadi Al-Aska basin (East of Jeddah City), Saudi Arabia. Before
   the suitability analysis, urban development in the Jeddah area from 1973
   to 2009 was applied. In the current study, an integrated evaluation of
   the suitable areas for urban development is proposed by using
   geological, geomorphological, and geographical characteristics of the
   study area as well as flash flood hazard factor. The used parameters
   were correlated by using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP)
   method and incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS) in
   order to produce the corresponding suitability maps. The study area is
   classified into five categories including very high, high, moderate,
   low, and very low suitability for urban development. These can be
   attributed mainly to the fact that in the majority of cases, only
   geographical, social, and economical factors were used for urban
   development, whereas in the current study, geomorphological,
   geographical, geological, and natural hazards parameters were quantified
   and taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{The paper examines the flash flood events that occurred over a decade in
   the Attica prefecture, the most urbanized region of Greece, with the aim
   of identifying triggering rainfall thresholds, as well as assessing the
   effect of rainfall upon the magnitude of the induced damages. The
   analysis incorporates rainfall records from a network of 28 surface
   meteorological stations and information on the spatial distribution of
   the flash flood events that is derived from the active database of
   damaging weather events maintained by the atmospheric modelling group of
   the National Observatory of Athens. The main findings concern firstly
   the relation between the flash flood impact, as measured by the fire
   service operations in flooded properties, and precipitation in various
   time intervals. In the period 2005-2014, 48 damaging flash flood events
   occurred in the target area and caused more than 3500 fire service
   operations in flooded properties. Most of the events are associated with
   maximum accumulated rainfall of more than 20mm in 24 h and 3mm in 10
   min. However, the flash flood impact intensity, as measured by the
   number of the fire service operations per event, increases significantly
   above the levels of 60mm in 24 h and 10mm in 10 min. Secondly, graphs of
   rainfall intensity versus duration are developed for 15 sub-areas of

   in the last years in urban areas. The DWA-BWK guideline for practical
   precaution measures demonstrates explains a practical approach how

Abstract = {{River flooding causes significant losses to crops and negatively affects
   local agriculture economies, particularly in rural riverine areas. In
   this work, a techno-economic methodology for the monetary estimation of
   crop losses due to flash flooding is presented. The methodology takes
   into account flood depth and flow velocity, as provided by MIKE FLOOD,
   as well as the season of flood occurrence, and provides monetary
   estimates of crop damage based on synthetic logistic flow velocity-flood
   depth-crop damage surfaces. The development of the flood damage surfaces
   involved a questionnaire survey targeting practicing and research
   agronomists. Subsequently, a weighted Monte Carlo simulation was
   performed in order to enhance the questionnaire-based loss estimate
   information. Finally, synthetic flow velocity-flood depth-crop damage
   surfaces were developed for every crop under study and for every month
   using logistic regression analysis. The damage surfaces are an essential
   component of the developed model which was implemented in Python,
   enabling the GIS visualization of the estimated agricultural damage. The
   aforementioned methodology was applied for estimating the damage caused
   by a flash flood that took place in the Koiliaris River Basin in Crete
   for which no historical data exist. The novelty of the proposed
   methodology is the development of local synthetic flow velocity-flood
   depth-crop damage surfaces. Furthermore, the velocity parameter, which
   is taken into account, makes the methodology suitable for flash flood
   events, where significant discharges and high velocities dominate, or
   for flood event cases which are characterized by high flow velocities.
   The methodology identifies rural areas and agricultural land uses that
   are most prone to flooding and serious crop damages and thus require
   greater attention. Furthermore, the methodology aptitude for developing
   local damage surfaces could be modulated in order to confront different
   flood scenarios on various crops distributions and be used to address
   agricultural planning activities.}},

Abstract = {{A study was undertaken to review international literature pertaining to
   people's behavior in and around floodwater. The review focused on
   people's voluntary entry of floodwater. From the literature, five
   predominant reasons for entering floodwater were identified, including
   undertaking a recreational activity; attempting to reach a destination;
   retrieving property, livestock, or pets; undertaking employment duties;
   and rescuing or assisting with evacuation. Two primary influences on
   entering floodwater were found, namely risk perception (i.e., being
   unaware of or underestimating the risk from flooding) and social
   influences (i.e., being influenced by others). Demographics and
   environmental and temporal factors also played a part in decision-making
   about whether to enter floodwater or not. Emergency managers should take
   account of such factors when devising future public education
   strategies. Further research, including comparisons with current
   theoretical models, could help identify additional influences on
   decision-making for floodwater entry.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the current state and development of a prototype
   web-GIS (Geographic Information System) decision support platform
   intended for application in natural hazards and risk management, mainly
   for floods and landslides. This web platform uses open-source geospatial
   software and technologies, particularly the Boundless (formerly OpenGeo)
   framework and its client side software development kit (SDK). The main
   purpose of the platform is to assist the experts and stakeholders in the
   decision-making process for evaluation and selection of different risk
   management strategies through an interactive participation approach,
   integrating web-GIS interface with decision support tool based on a
   compromise programming approach. The access rights and functionality of
   the platform are varied depending on the roles and responsibilities of
   stakeholders in managing the risk. The application of the prototype
   platform is demonstrated based on an example case study site:
   Malborghetto Valbruna municipality of North-Eastern Italy where flash
   floods and landslides are frequent with major events having occurred in
   2003. The preliminary feedback collected from the stakeholders in the
   region is discussed to understand the perspectives of stakeholders on
   the proposed prototype platform.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood is one of the natural disasters that cause severe damage in
   many parts around the world. The large numbers of villager who reside
   along the stream side suffer by losing their accommodations, properties,
   and life. The reason that made flash flood very dangerous is abruptly
   happening with no proper warning. The flash flood and landslide warning
   system are developed to forecast and warn the citizens who live in the
   risky area. Various criteria are selected under the Meteorology theory.
   This research focuses on measuring the varying of the water level and
   flow rate of the stream. Sets of sensors are going to be installed along
   the stream located from the upper stream to the village area. The
   sensors node has been developed to measure the interesting data. It able
   to work as a standalone self-powered by photovoltaic cell and as a
   remote terminal of sensor network system. Each node consists of local
   controller which is able to process the raw data and the communication
   module which is functioned to send the information to the server. The
   industrial control system SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition) system is selected to work as a central control program of
   the warning system. The HMI (Human Machine Interface) is designed based
   on the contour map of the interest area.
   The developed system has been tested in two phrases the standalone
   sensor node and the network test. The laboratory results show that the
   system able to measure the level precisely and real-time. Each of remote
   terminals can utilize the power generated by photovoltaic cell
   sufficiently. The SCADA system can retrieve the information from each
   sensor nodes correctly.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1481-1497}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Social vulnerability explains the sociological and human-dependent
   circumstances that translate a natural event into a deadly disaster.
   But, what are the space-time characteristics of vulnerability (i.e.,
   dynamic vulnerability) that influence how people are impacted by a
   specific natural hazard? This paper performs a critical analysis of
   previous flood-related human impact and vulnerability studies to better
   understand and summarize the human-related factors that determine the
   impacts from flash flood events. The paper is motivated by the
   hypothesis that the intersection of the spatiotemporal context of the
   hazard with the distribution of people and their characteristics across
   space and time reveals different paths of vulnerability and defines the
   most probable space of an exposed area in terms of deadly impacts. Based
   on this idea, a conceptual model for assessing vulnerability to flash
   flooding is developed and presented herein. The most important advance
   of the current research in comparison with previous efforts in
   vulnerability assessment is the introduction of the concept of the
   spatial and temporal variability of vulnerability. This means that the
   proposed conceptual model does not consider vulnerability as a static
   synopsis that can be described by a single map, but as an ever-evolving
   process derived from the interaction of social and physical dynamics.
   The dynamic perspective of vulnerability is key for the identification
   of pertinent vulnerability variables to be used for flash flood
   vulnerability assessment and dynamic mapping, and prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Flood protection is a society-wide task. The basic rules of prevention
   in flood protection are stipulated by the regulation of a secondary
   right of the European Union-Directive of the European Parliament and
   Council 2007/60/EC on assessment and management of flood risks. The
   paper is focused on preliminary flood risk assessment of flash floods.
   The task was to obtain knowledge on the spatial variability of flood
   risk from flash floods and in doing so supplement a preliminary flood
   risk assessment already conducted in 2011 for the purpose of proposing
   suitable flood mitigation measures for reducing the risk found. Flood
   risk in this study is understood as a combination of flood hazard and
   vulnerability. The main part of the work is devoted to the proposal of a
   methodological approach for preliminary flood risk assessment of flash
   floods. Application of the proposed approach in Bodva river basin,
   southern Slovakia, is described in the results section.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are often responsible for many deaths and involve many
   material damages. Regarding Mediterranean karst aquifers, the complexity
   of connections, between surface and groundwater, as well as weather
   non-stationarity patterns, increase difficulties in understanding the
   basins behaviour and thus warning and protecting people. Furthermore,
   given the recent changes in land use and extreme rainfall events,
   knowledge of the past floods is no longer sufficient to manage flood
   risks. Therefore the worst realistic flood that could occur should be
   considered.
   Physical and processes-based hydrological models are considered among
   the best ways to forecast floods under diverse conditions. However, they
   rarely match with the stakeholders' needs. In fact, the forecasting
   services, the municipalities, and the civil security have difficulties
   in running and interpreting data-consuming models in real-time, above
   all if data are uncertain or non-existent. To face these social and
   technical difficulties and help stakeholders, this study develops two
   operational tools derived from these models. These tools aim at planning
   real-time decisions given little, changing, and uncertain information
   available, which are: (i) a hydrological graphical tool (abacus) to
   estimate flood peak discharge from the karst past state and the
   forecasted but uncertain intense rainfall; (ii) a GIS-based method
   (MARE) to estimate the potential flooded pathways and areas, accounting
   for runoff and karst contributions and considering land use changes.
   Then, outputs of these tools are confronted to past and recent floods
   and municipalities observations, and the impacts of uncertainties and
   changes on planning decisions are discussed. The use of these tools on
   the recent 2014 events demonstrated their reliability and interest for
   stakeholders.
   This study was realized on French Mediterranean basins, in close
   collaboration with the Flood Forecasting Services (SPC Med-Ouest,
   SCHAPI, municipalities).}},

Abstract = {{In Eastern Romania there are conditions for flash floods occurrence like
   the intensity and duration of rainfall, the topography, soil condition,
   coverage of the terrain, especially in small ungauged basins with no
   functional hydrotechnical and land reclamation works. When proposing
   mitigation measures it must be taken into account the unforeseeability
   of the place, local scale of the event, and particularly the violence of
   the phenomenon, as well as the very short response time and the great
   threat to human lives. The costs are a very important and sensitive
   aspect taking into account that the case study covers a poor Romanian
   area. Therefore non-structural measures could be more appropriate and
   feasible than the structural ones. The paper is focused on identifying
   the most easily and efficiently mitigation measures to be implemented
   based on flash flood hydrological modelling for Pojoratan subbasin.}},

   Union in April 2013, which was welcomed by Member States. The role of
   the European Union may be particularly appropriate in the case of

   within the river basin, and when the impacts are different between
   regions. The role of the European Union can be particularly useful for
   strengthening solidarity between Member States and may consist in
   ensuring the fact that disadvantaged regions and regions most affected
   by climate change are able to take the necessary measures to adapt to
   the new situation. Recently, the acute problem of torrential rain is
   very timely also for the Czech Republic. The aim of this paper is the

Abstract = {{Across the Mediterranean region, extreme weather events (EWE), such as
   high-intensity storms causing flooding in small river basins, are one of
   the most common types of hydrometeorological hazards. Flooding has been
   associated with severe effects on road networks and a significant number
   of vehicle-related fatalities, raising concerns regarding the
   performance of transportation infrastructure during EWEs. Given the
   expected increase in frequency of such events within the context of
   climate change, an assessment of its vulnerability is particularly
   crucial. The work presented herein evaluates the performance of
   transportation infrastructure during high-intensity storms. This
   research focuses on small rural catchments, examining the impact of five
   extreme storm events in five rural basins in Greece. Post-flood surveys
   were conducted, to record the impact of inundation on each
   infrastructure element in the five catchments. Overall, findings showed
   that road infrastructure, especially river crossings, performed poorly,
   restricting access to large areas during and after the events, affecting
   the safety of commuters and sustaining extensive damages. On average, it
   was found that 73\% of the river crossings and 11.5\% of the total
   length of the road network were inundated or damaged, while a total of
   12 individuals died during the events. The results revealed that the
   impact of flooding in the transportation infrastructure of small rural
   basins was severe and a threat to human life. The findings of this study
   indicate that authorities should consider taking measures during EWEs,
   re-examine the safety features of the relevant infrastructure and assess
   the risk related to its failure.}},

Abstract = {{The paper explores, from a householder's point of view, the
   effectiveness and need for an improved flood warning system in an inland
   regional city, Toowoomba, which experienced a severe flash flood in
   January 2011. A survey was conducted across 75 households in four
   different areas in Toowoomba. It investigated how many people received a
   warning about the flash flood, how they were warned, and their opinion
   of flood warning systems post-flood. The results show that no flash
   flood warning was issued and the local community was completely
   overwhelmed by the January 2011 flash flood event. Overall awareness of
   the risk of flash floods appeared to be quite high, especially following
   the January 2011 event, and the common opinion was that a flash flood
   warning system in Toowoomba would be extremely useful. However, a level
   of uncertainty exists, particularly with regard to who should be
   responsible for providing flood warning systems. Education and home
   location in the risk areas are identified as important variables
   influencing opinion and awareness of flash flooding. Improved and
   coordinated information together with clear lines of responsibility for
   providing flood information, better lead time, and more reliable flood
   warning will greatly assist in future flood risk mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{The metropolitan area and the city of Genoa has become a national and
   international case study for geohydrological risk, mainly due to the
   frequency of floods. In 2014, there were landslides again, as well as
   flash floods that have particularly caused casualties and economic
   damage. The weather features of the Gulf of Genoa and the
   geomorphological-environmental setting of the Ligurian coastal land are
   the predisposing factors that determine heavy rains and their resulting
   effects on the ground.
   This study analysed the characteristics of the main meteorological
   disasters that have hit Genoa since the start of the 20th century;
   changes in the rainfall regime are evaluated and the main stages of
   urbanization of the area are detailed, with the resulting changes to the
   drainage network, in order to identify the main causes of this high
   geohydrological risk. To this end, scientists have used climate data
   recorded at the station of Genoa University, in operation since 1833,
   and at Ponte Carrega station, located in the middle reach of the Bisagno
   stream, a well-known watercourse because of its frequent floods. Urban
   sprawl was evaluated through a multi-temporal mapping comparison, using
   maps available from the beginning of the 19th century up to the current
   regional technical maps. The average air temperature in Genoa shows a
   statistically significant increase, while the number of rainy days
   displays an equally clear decrease over time. The total annual rain
   value does not seem to indicate rather noticeable changes. The intensity
   of rain in Genoa expressed as rainfall rate, i.e. the ratio of annual
   rainfall and number of rainy days, shows statistically significant
   growth.
   The geohydrological vulnerability in Genoa has increased over time due
   to urban development which has established modifications in land use,
   from agricultural to urban, especially in the valley floor. Waterways
   have been confined and reduced to artificial channels, often covered in
   their final stretch; in some cases they have even been totally removed.
   These actions should be at least partially reversed in order to reduce
   the presently high hydrological risk.}},

Abstract = {{Timely warning communication and decision making are critical for
   reducing harm from flash flooding. To help understand and improve
   extreme weather risk communication and management, this study uses a
   mental models research approach to investigate the flash flood warning
   system and its risk decision context. Data were collected in the
   Boulder, Colorado area from mental models interviews with forecasters,
   public officials, and media broadcasters, who each make important
   interacting decisions in the warning system, and from a group modeling
   session with forecasters. Analysis of the data informed development of a
   decision-focused model of the flash flood warning system that integrates
   the professionals' perspectives. Comparative analysis of individual and
   group data with this model characterizes how these professionals
   conceptualize flash flood risks and associated uncertainty; create and
   disseminate flash flood warning information; and perceive how warning
   information is ( and should be) used in their own and others' decisions.
   The analysis indicates that warning system functioning would benefit
   from professionals developing a clearer, shared understanding of flash
   flood risks and the warning system, across their areas of expertise and
   job roles. Given the challenges in risk communication and decision
   making for complex, rapidly evolving hazards such as flash floods,
   another priority is development of improved warning content to help
   members of the public protect themselves when needed. Also important is
   professional communication with members of the public about allocation
   of responsibilities for managing flash flood risks, as well as improved
   system-wide management of uncertainty in decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The Garhwal Himalaya tragedy of 16-17 June 2013 was perhaps the worst
   disaster of the last century seen in India owing to unprecedented
   rainfall. The extreme rainfall together with bursting of moraine-dammed
   Chorabari Lake caused devastating flooding of the Mandakini River and
   its tributaries in the Garhwal Himalaya. Several downstream settlements
   such as Kedarnath (3546 m a.s.l.), Rambara (2740 m a.s.l.) and Gaurikund
   (1990 m a.s.l.) were damaged due to flash floods. The present study was
   taken up to assess the extent of devastation in the Mandakini Valley
   from Kedarnath to Sonprayag based on ground observations, repeated
   ground photography, discussion with local residents (eye witnesses) and
   analysis of pre-event and post-event high-resolution satellite data.
   Overall 137 `flash flood-induced debris flow' events were mapped in the
   Mandakini Valley between Kedarnath and Sonprayag which led to the
   catastrophe and miseries to the pilgrims. The area of `flash
   flood-induced debris flow' and the main channel of Mandakini River were
   increased by similar to 575 and similar to 406 \%, respectively, during
   the 16-17 June 2013 event. About 50 \% (7 km) of the pedestrian route
   (14 km) between Gaurikund and Kedarnath was completely washed away which
   obstructed the rescue operations to evacuate pilgrims, tourists and
   local people after the 16-17 June 2013 event. The `flash flood-induced
   debris flow' and moraine-dammed lake outburst events together washed
   away similar to 120 and similar to 90 buildings around Kedarnath shrine
   and in Rambara town, respectively, although the main Kedarnath temple
   survived with minor damage. The database of flash flood-induced debris
   flows and flood effected area generated in the present research will
   facilitate to other disciplines (e.g., future settlements planning) for
   long-term reconstruction work in the affected areas of the Mandakini
   Valley.}},

Abstract = {{The dominant paradigm in disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies has been
   seriously contested because of its reliance on interventions based on
   technocratic expertise. In the Mexican context, the influence of
   informal practices such as clientelism and cartelisation of the
   political system produces environmental degradation and vulnerability to
   disasters within the communities in the study site. This paper
   contributes to understanding of failed institutional processes and
   parallel practices that intensify vulnerability to disasters by
   contrasting the discourses of agents within a peri-urban community in
   central Mexico. Employing the Situational Analysis Approach as a
   methodological framework, the study identifies divergent views and
   practices within the community, leading to different responses to
   disasters and to different perceptions regarding institutional
   performance. In addition, it finds that institutional decision-making,
   based only on scientific and technical expertise, has resulted in
   unintended consequences that influence ongoing vulnerability to floods
   in the site under review.}},

Abstract = {{Having access to real-time spatial information is central to the
   functioning of disaster management, and in particular disaster response.
   Existing spatially-enabled solutions for managing urban disasters
   provide limited support for time-sensitivity and urgency underlying
   emergency situations. These approaches mainly suffer from low temporal
   resolution and inability to source a broad range of required disaster
   data, together with insufficient support for automated operations.
   However, disaster management procedures, integrated with in situ
   sensing, promise an extensive range of real-time data and automated
   processes to acquire and manage disaster information. In this research,
   we study the process of integrating multi-agency in situ sensors for
   supporting disaster management. For this purpose, the research was
   adopted in Australia as the case study area in disaster management of a
   flood by emphasizing on the response phase. This paper first identifies
   the issues and existing requirements in the process of multi-agency
   sensor information integration and then proposes a standard-based
   approach to overcoming these integration issues. Afterward, based on the
   presented approach and identified requirements, a GIS-based software
   IDDSS-Sensor is implemented to provide the functions of standard-based
   access, as well as on-the-fly harmonization, integration and usage of
   multi-agency sensor information. We evaluate the applicability of our
   developed approach by applying it to the use case of supporting flash
   flood evacuation response. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Riyadh, the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has experienced
   unusual levels of urbanization in the past few decades, making it one of
   the fastest growing cities in the world. This paper examines flood
   hazards in the rapidly urbanizing catchment of Al-Aysen in Riyadh.
   Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were
   employed to obtain and prepare input data for hydrologic and hydraulic
   models, with the former based on the very popular curve number approach.
   Due to the limited nature of the rainfall data, observations from two
   rain gauges in the vicinity of the catchment were used to estimate
   design storms. The hydrologic model was run in a semi-distributed mode
   by dividing the catchment into many sub-catchments. The impact of
   urbanization on run-off volume and peak discharge resulting from
   different storms was investigated, with various urbanization scenarios
   simulated. Flood hazard zones and affected streets were also identified
   through hydrologic/hydraulic model simulation. The mismatch between
   administrative and catchment boundaries can create problems in flood
   risk management for similar cities since hydrologic processes and flood
   hazards are based on the hydrologic connectivity. Since flooding events
   impact the road network and create driving hazards, governmental
   decision-makers must take the necessary precautions to protect drivers
   in these situations.}},

   vulnerability of two French cities, Besancon and Moissac, which were
   largely impacted by floods in January 1910 and March 1930, respectively.
   Both flood events figure among the most significant events recorded in
   France during the 20th century, in terms of certain parameters such as
   the intensity and severity of the flood and spatial extension of the
   damage. An analysis of historical sources allows the mapping of land use
   and occupation within the areas affected by the two floods, both in past
   and present contexts, providing an insight of the complexity of flood
   risk evolution at a local scale.}},

Abstract = {{Kedarnath was devastated on 16th evening-17th morning (June 2013) due to
   landslides and flash floods that killed more than 5000 people in
   Uttarakhand. What really happened on 16th evening through next 12 h till
   final deluge on 17th morning has been a subject of speculation due to
   lack of sufficient eye witness and monitoring system. Earth observation
   techniques have provided information on precipitation, landslides, snow
   cover and other ancillary data such as digital elevation models at
   varying resolution. Using such spatial information along with limited
   eye witness and media reports, an attempt is made to reconstruct events
   that led to destruction in upper Mandakini valley with prime aim to
   improve response and minimise damage in the event of similar disaster in
   future. The study has revealed that there were two distinct events
   separated by a time gap of 10-12 h: the first event was triggered by
   series of landslides, river blockades, breaching, flooding and river
   bank failures, whereas the second event was mainly associated with
   Chorabari Tal Lake outburst flooding along with associated landslides
   and bank erosion. Comprehensive assessment of landslide hazard requires
   process-based modelling using numerical simulation methods. The present
   study aims to focus on analysis of landslides/debris flow movements and
   simulate landslides that occurred in Kedarnath event leading to
   derivation of important flow parameters to get closer to the root cause
   of the devastation. The unique geomorphological setting, which has
   changed significantly in the recent event, provides valuable inputs for
   critical assessment of damage and remedial measures in future.
   Comparison with Gohna Tal (in Birahi Ganga, a tributary of Alaknanda)
   landslide lake outburst flooding has provided closer insight on the
   event and it revealed how preparedness can reduce the impact of such
   natural disasters.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how people view flash flood risks can help improve risk
   communication, ultimately improving outcomes. This article analyzes data
   from 26 mental models interviews about flash floods with members of the
   public in Boulder, Colorado, to understand their perspectives on flash
   flood risks and mitigation. The analysis includes a comparison between
   public and professional perspectives by referencing a companion mental
   models study of Boulder-area professionals. A mental models approach can
   help to diagnose what people already know about flash flood risks and
   responses, as well as any critical gaps in their knowledge that might be
   addressed through improved risk communication. A few public interviewees
   mentioned most of the key concepts discussed by professionals as
   important for flash flood warning decision making. However, most
   interviewees exhibited some incomplete understandings and misconceptions
   about aspects of flash flood development and exposure, effects, or
   mitigation that may lead to ineffective warning decisions when a flash
   flood threatens. These include important misunderstandings about the
   rapid evolution of flash floods, the speed of water in flash floods, the
   locations and times that pose the greatest flash flood risk in Boulder,
   the value of situational awareness and environmental cues, and the most
   appropriate responses when a flash flood threatens. The findings point
   to recommendations for ways to improve risk communication, over the long
   term and when an event threatens, to help people quickly recognize and
   understand threats, obtain needed information, and make informed
   decisions in complex, rapidly evolving extreme weather events such as
   flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{Dam failure causes catastrophic flooding and immense damage downstream.
   There are many factors that affect the magnitude of such flash floods.
   In this study the influence of reservoir side slopes on dam-break
   hydrographs and water levels was investigated using experimental and
   numerical methods. Ideal trapezoidal reservoirs with different side
   angles varying from 30 degrees to 90 degrees were examined in the
   laboratory, while the reservoir capacity and breach cross section were
   considered to be the same. Due to the experimental limitations for
   measuring the flow parameters at any required points, 3D-numerical
   modeling was used. The results showed that the dam-break flood from the
   reservoir with a 30 degrees side slope has the highest peak-discharge,
   the sharpest rising and recession limbs of the hydrograph, and the
   earliest maximum water level and discharge. Based on the results, in
   view of risk assessment, the reservoirs with lower side slopes are
   expected to have more potential risk for damage in the event of dam
   break.}},

Abstract = {{The flood risk management is based on the application of policies and
   practices in order to identify the vulnerable areas, their analysis and
   evaluation, and establish the necessary measures to reduce risk to
   vulnerable human communities. In this category also fall the human
   settlements located at the contact between the mountain area of the
   Oriental Carpathians (in Romania) and the adjacent areas, which are
   often affected by flash floods. These flash floods typically occur in
   relatively small catchments as that of the Sucevita river with an area
   of 199 km(2). The present study focuses on the analysis of the main
   factors that generate and favour the emergence of flash floods, as well
   as on the efficiency of structural and non-structural measures which
   were taken at the level of the communities located in the floodplain of
   the river. The research is based on the investigation of local
   authorities by means of questionnaires. The data processing was
   performed through qualitative methods and the interpretation through
   statistical methods. The results of the study highlight the need for a
   proper plan regarding the complete planning of the Sucevita catchment
   correlated with an effective evacuation plan for the population.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing and communicating public perception on flood risk became
   essential for assuming effective and efficient management actions and
   policies, especially in areas prone to extreme natural events (e. g.
   floods). The current study explores the community awareness and
   perception on flash floods and their role in fostering social
   resilience, in relation to the mitigation measures carried out by local
   authorities. The study-area is located in the Bend Subcarpathians
   (Romania), a region known for its high seismicity and dynamics of
   hydro-geomorphic processes (e. g. floods/flash floods, landslides). The
   area proved its high exposure to flash floods in small river catchments
   (below 200 km(2)), during some recent major events (e. g. 2005, 2010),
   which impacted significantly the local rural communities, determining
   great losses to their assets, as well as psychological effects. The
   current research relies on a questionnaire-based survey which was
   conducted in the summer of 2014 and addressed to 50 households form
   seven rural settlements, significantly affected by flash floods.
   Therewith, several structured interviews were held with local
   authorities (e. g. local decision-makers, county Civil Protection
   Inspectors). The questionnaire survey provides some valuable insight
   into the local human vulnerability to environmental change and extreme
   hydro-meteorological events, aiming to outline the previous personal
   experience, people's awareness and worrying, as well as the
   post-disaster level of preparedness. The survey underlined some
   discrepancies between people's perception on the local authority's
   reaction during and post-event and the local authorities' perception on
   their response and preparedness measures. Moreover, a high interest of
   local authorities to access scientific data (e. g. flash flood hazard
   and risk maps, climate change projections) in order to support the
   development of adequate mitigation measures, was also noticed. However,
   the lack of financial support is still limiting factor in their
   implementation, as well as the development of long-term strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This ethnographic study reveals how expertise was sought, articulated
   and actuated across online and offline worlds to enable the evacuation
   of 38 horses from an isolated ranch in the mountainous region of
   Northern Colorado following a series of devastating flash floods in
   September 2013. The shared expertise within a loosely connected
   community of practice bridged spatial-temporal limitations and afforded
   opportunities for practical assistance and response, both virtually and
   on the ground. Interaction via social media articulated the parameters
   of the emergent problem to be solved, and ``cast a net{''} to find the
   expertise necessary to address different aspects of the perceived
   problem. Eventually, more than 60 people with equine expertise converged
   onto the ranch, bringing their materials to execute a single-day
   evacuation and relocation of the herd.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme weather events such as floods and droughts can have devastating
   consequences for individual well being and economic development, in
   particular in poor societies with limited availability of coping
   mechanisms. Combining a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of
   the Yemeni economy with a household-level calorie consumption simulation
   model, this paper assesses the economy-wide, agricultural and food
   security effects of the 2008 tropical storm and flash flood that hit the
   Hadramout and Al-Mahrah governorates. The estimation results suggest
   that agricultural value added, farm household incomes and rural food
   security deteriorated long term in the flood-affected areas. Due to
   economic spillover effects, significant income losses and increases in
   food insecurity also occurred in areas that were unaffected by flooding.
   This finding suggests that while most relief efforts are typically
   concentrated in directly affected areas, future efforts should also
   consider surrounding areas and indirectly affected people.}},

Abstract = {{Floods in the southern rim of the Indian Himalayas are a major cause of
   loss of life, property, crops, infrastructure, etc. They have long term
   socio-economic impacts on the habitat living along/across the Himalayas.
   In the recent decade extreme precipitation events have led to numerous
   flash floods in and around the Himalayan region. Sporadic case-based
   studies have tried to explain the mechanisms causing the floods.
   However, in some of the cases, the causative mechanisms have been
   elusive. Various types of flood events have been debated at different
   spatial and temporal scales. The present study provides an overview of
   mechanisms that lead to floods in and around the southern rim of the
   Indian Himalayas. Atmospheric processes, landuse interaction, and
   glacier-related outbreaks are considered in the overview. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Risk assessment and protection of the built infrastructure for flood
   events The increase in number, intensity and damage of extreme natural
   events is a growing threat to public security and for the built
   infrastructure. The following article explains the risk management with
   respect to flood. In the context of national and international research
   projects, the authors develop practical engineering-tools for a fast
   determination of the vulnerability of the built infrastructure, like
   public buildings and transport infrastructures, in order to derive risk
   assessments in disaster events and to provide decision support for
   rescue forces. The engineering-tools include, among other things, a
   decision-support-system with recommendations for strengthening and
   repairing of structures in the case of major flooding. Structures are
   evaluated with rapid analysis, but also with detailed numerical
   calculation. The research projects are interdisciplinary
   joint-research-projects and the authors are working at different aspects
   for the assessment of the built infrastructure. For the effects on built
   infrastructure during flood and for prevention of disaster events, there
   is no standardization at hand. There are just a few guidelines for the
   protection of structures for a flood event. For this reason load models
   for static and dynamic loads during a flood are developed, in order to
   create a basis for the assessment of robustness of structures. The
   determination of the remaining carrying capacity during and after a
   flood event is in the primary focus. This is the basis for the analysis
   of the resilience of the built infrastructure. In this article the
   implementation of the classical action strategy in disaster management
   (pre-, during-, post-incident) in a software-tool is presented and with
   that, innovative methods with geo-information-systems (GIS) and 3D-city-
   and building models (BIM) are shown.}},

Abstract = {{This article outlines the results of a descriptive study that analyses
   loss and damage caused by hydrometeorological disasters in Brazil
   between 2010 and 2014 using the EM DAT (global) and S2iD (national)
   databases. The analysis shows major differences in the total number of
   disaster events included in the databases (EMDAT = 36; S2iD = 4,070) and
   estimated costs of loss and damage (EM-DAT - R\$ 9.2 billion; S2iD - R\$
   331.4 billion). The analysis also shows that the five states most
   affected by these events are Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas
   Gerais, Sao Paulo and Parana in Brazil's South and Southeast regions and
   that these results are consistent with the findings of other studies.
   The costs of disasters were highest for housing, public infrastructure
   works, collectively used public facilities, other public service
   facilities, and state health and education facilities. The costs
   associated with public health facilities were also high. Despite their
   limitations, both databases demonstrated their usefulness for
   determining seasonal and long-term trends and patterns, and risk areas,
   and thus assist decision makers in identifying areas that are most
   affected by and vulnerable to natural disasters.}},

Abstract = {{Urban pluvial flood are attracting growing public concern due to rising
   intense precipitation and increasing consequences. Accurate risk
   assessment is critical to an efficient urban pluvial flood management,
   particularly in transportation sector. This paper describes an
   integrated methodology, which initially makes use of high resolution 2D
   inundation modeling and flood depth-dependent measure to evaluate the
   potential impact and risk of pluvial flash flood on road network in the
   city center of Shanghai, China. Intensity-Duration-Frequency
   relationships of Shanghai rainstorm and Chicago Design Storm are
   combined to generate ensemble rainfall scenarios. A hydrodynamic model
   (FloodMap-HydroInundation2D) is used to simulate overland flow and flood
   inundation for each scenario. Furthermore, road impact and risk
   assessment are respectively conducted by a new proposed algorithm and
   proxy. Results suggest that the flood response is a function of
   spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation and local characteristics
   (i.e. drainage and topography), and pluvial flash flood is found to lead
   to proportionate but nonlinear impact on intra-urban road inundation
   risk. The approach tested here would provide more detailed flood
   information for smart management of urban street network and may be
   applied to other big cities where road flood risk is evolving in the
   context of climate change and urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{European Union directives as well as national legislation are placing
   great emphasis on the inclusion of stakeholder perspectives in the
   governance of risks from natural hazards. This should help decision
   makers formulate better policies. However, to date, there is little
   information on stakeholders' perspectives with respect to landslide risk
   governance. This paper addresses the gap by reporting on research in
   Nocera Inferiore, Italy. The research is based on a documentary
   analysis, 43 semi-structured interviews and a survey submitted to 373
   residents. The political instability, the unfairness of national funding
   allocation across municipalities and the residents' lack of knowledge
   about risk assessment and emergency planning are some of the main
   barriers to effective risk governance. Moreover, there are divergent,
   sometimes even opposite, stakeholders' views on several issues, such as
   the relevance of illegal development in risky areas. The results
   highlight the importance of addressing these divergent views and
   including the plurality of voices as a prerequisite for inclusive risk
   governance. The research provided essential background information for a
   participatory process, which was designed to support decisions on
   landslide risk mitigation measures in Nocera Inferiore (Linnerooth-Bayer
   et al. this issue). The methodology will be of more general interest to
   researchers and policy-makers intent upon including stakeholder
   perspectives in natural risk governance.}},

Abstract = {{Vulnerability assessment implies a quantitative evaluation of the
   individual vulnerability components such as elements at risk, their
   physical exposure and social characteristics. Current approaches in
   vulnerability research are driven by a divide between social scientists
   who tend to view vulnerability as representing a set of socio-economic
   factors, and scientists who view vulnerability in terms of the degree of
   loss to an element at risk. To close this gap, a multi-dimensional
   vulnerability analysis has been undertaken focusing on flash flood
   hazards in Greece. To represent physical vulnerability, an empirical
   relation between the process intensity and the degree of loss was
   established. With respect to social vulnerability, an assessment was
   undertaken by means of empirical data collection based on a door-to-door
   survey. In general, both physical and social vulnerability was
   comparable low, which is interpreted as a result from (a) specific
   building regulations in Greece as well as general design principles
   leading to less structural susceptibility of elements at risk exposed,
   and (b) a relatively low economic loss leading to less social
   vulnerability of citizens exposed. It is shown that a combination of
   different perspectives of vulnerability will lead to a better
   understanding of perceptions of actors regarding their vulnerabilities
   and capacities.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are among the significant natural hazards in Algeria. They cause
   severe casualties, damage to building and destruction of roads, public
   works, and infrastructures. Northwestern Algeria has experienced
   devastating floods in the past that caused considerable damage, e. g.,
   Mohammadia 1881, Mostaganem 1927, and El Asnam 1966. Analysis of
   historical floods is one of the major tools in flood hazard assessment
   that enables predicting future flood events. One of the objectives of
   this work is to address the gap of available information regarding the
   floods that happened in Algeria, particularly during historical times.
   The first historical data analysis that we performed on the basis of an
   intensive survey shows that the study area is subject to flooding. This
   inventory is the first step towards flood zonation and construction of
   an atlas of extreme floods in northwestern Algeria. The catalog of
   historical floods contains more than 127 documented events. As results,
   this paper presents a method of compiling historical flooding data and
   the analysis of the obtained database which represents a major
   contribution to flood risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{With its exceptionally steep topography, wet climate, and active
   faulting, landslides can be expected to occur in the Rwenzori Mountains.
   Whether or not this region is prone to landsliding and more generally
   whether global landslide inventories and hazard assessments are accurate
   in data-poor regions such as the East African highlands are thus far
   unclear. In order to address these questions, a first landslide
   inventory based on archive information is built for the Rwenzori
   Mountains. In total, 48 landslide and flash flood events, or
   combinations of these, are found. They caused 56 fatalities and
   considerable damage to road infrastructure, buildings, and cropland, and
   rendered over 14,000 persons homeless. These numbers indicate that the
   Rwenzori Mountains are landslide-prone and that the impact of these
   events is significant. Although not based on field investigations but on
   archive data from media reports and laymen accounts, our approach
   provides a useful complement to global inventories overlooking this
   region and increases our understanding of the phenomenon in the Rwenzori
   Mountains. Considering the severe impacts of landslides, the population
   growth and related anthropogenic interventions, and the likelihood of
   more intense rainfall conditions, there is an urgent need to invest in
   research on disaster risk reduction strategies in this region and other
   similar highland areas of Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Risk management policies promote prevention and call for risk culture
   programmes in hazardous areas in order to fight against the phenomenon
   of risk oblivion that one can notice after a disaster. My university
   thesis summarized in this article - questioned this possibility by
   investigating how we live, in everyday life, in flood-prone areas.
   Through an ethnographic piece of work, in particular a ``discreet
   resident observation{''}, the thesis seeks to identify what the
   inhabitants exchange about floods and how they organize their practices
   in relation to the risk. The field study, Lattes, is an upper
   middle-class suburban neighborhood located in the South East of France
   (Mediterranean coast). This city was built on wetlands and remains
   vulnerable to flash floods. This case study allows us to grasp the
   collective mechanisms at stake in the construction of the invisibility
   of a danger. The high visibility of the protection made by local
   policies and the comforting effect of normative sharing provided a
   normalization of people's trust in the protection. Through interactions,
   statements are built to be acceptable. It is more comfortable to
   ``de-dramatize{''} than to dramatize: statements of relativism circulate
   more than the ones that open on the horizon of danger. Moreover, the
   current development of a ``logic of safety{''} for urban risks reduction
   contradicts the prevention of flooding. Above all, neither the links
   between inhabitants nor the links with their living environment provide
   a sufficient collective base for the deployment of a risk culture.}},

Title = {{A Multimethod Approach towards Assessing Urban Flood Patterns and Its
   Associated Vulnerabilities in Singapore}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{We investigated flooding patterns in the urbanised city-state of
   Singapore through a multimethod approach combining station precipitation
   data with archival newspaper and governmental records; changes in flash
   floods frequencies or reported impacts of floods towards Singapore
   society were documented. We subsequently discussed potential flooding
   impacts in the context of urban vulnerability, based on future
   urbanisation and forecasted precipitation projections for Singapore. We
   find that, despite effective flood management, (i) significant increases
   in reported flash flood frequency occurred in contemporary (post-2000)
   relative to preceding (1984-1999) periods, (ii) these flash floods
   coincide with more localised, ``patchy{''} storm events, (iii) storms in
   recent years are also more intense and frequent, and (iv) floods result
   in low human casualties but have high economic costs via insurance
   damage claims. We assess that Singapore presently has low vulnerability
   to floods vis-a-vis other regional cities largely due to holistic flood
   management via consistent and successful infrastructural development,
   widespread flood monitoring, and effective advisory platforms. We
   conclude, however, that future vulnerabilities may increase from
   stresses arising from physical exposure to climate change and from
   demographic sensitivity via rapid population growth. Anticipating these
   changes is potentially useful in maintaining the high resilience of
   Singapore towards this hydrometeorological hazard.}},

Abstract = {{Climate, weather and water hazards do not recognize national boundaries.
   Transboundary/regional programs and cooperation are essential to reduce
   the loss of lives and damage to livelihoods when facing these hazards.
   The development and implementation of systems to provide early warnings
   for severe weather events such as cyclones and flash floods requires
   data and information sharing in real time, and coordination among the
   government agencies at all levels. Within a country, this includes
   local, municipal, provincial-to-national levels as well as regional and
   international entities involved in hydrometeorological services and
   Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). Of key importance are the National
   Meteorological and Hydrologic Services (NMHSs). The NMHS is generally
   the authority solely responsible for issuing warnings for these hazards.
   However, in many regions of the world, the linkages and interfaces
   between the NMHS and other agencies are weak or non-existent. Therefore,
   there is a critical need to assess, strengthen, and formalize
   collaborations when addressing the concept of reducing risk and impacts
   from severe weather and floods. The U.S. Agency for International
   Development/Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance; the United
   Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO); the WMO Southern Africa
   Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, hosted by the South African
   Weather Service; the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration/National Weather Service and the Hydrologic Research
   Center (a non-profit corporation) are currently implementing a project
   working with Southern Africa NMHSs on addressing this gap. The project
   aims to strengthen coordination and collaboration mechanisms from
   national to local levels. The project partners are working with the
   NMHSs to apply and implement appropriate tools and infrastructure to
   enhance currently operational severe weather and flash flood early
   warning systems in each country in support of delivery and communication
   of warnings for the DRR entities at the regional, national and local
   levels in order to reduce the loss of life and property.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Analysis of ensemble forecasting strategies, which can provide a
   tangible backing for flood early warning procedures and mitigation
   measures over the Mediterranean region, is one of the fundamental
   motivations of the international HyMeX programme. Here, we examine two
   severe hydrometeorological episodes that affected the Milano urban area
   and for which the complex flood protection system of the city did not
   completely succeed. Indeed, flood damage have exponentially increased
   during the last 60 years, due to industrial and urban developments.
   Thus, the improvement of the Milano flood control system needs a
   synergism between structural and non-structural approaches. First, we
   examine how land-use changes due to urban development have altered the
   hydrological response to intense rainfalls. Second, we test a flood
   forecasting system which comprises the Flash-flood Event-based Spatially
   distributed rainfall-runoff Transformation, including Water Balance
   (FEST-WB) and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models.
   Accurate forecasts of deep moist convection and extreme precipitation
   are difficult to be predicted due to uncertainties arising from the
   numeric weather prediction (NWP) physical parameterizations and high
   sensitivity to misrepresentation of the atmospheric state; however, two
   hydrological ensemble prediction systems (HEPS) have been designed to
   explicitly cope with uncertainties in the initial and lateral boundary
   conditions (IC/LBCs) and physical parameterizations of the NWP model. No
   substantial differences in skill have been found between both ensemble
   strategies when considering an enhanced diversity of IC/LBCs for the
   perturbed initial conditions ensemble. Furthermore, no additional
   benefits have been found by considering more frequent LBCs in a mixed
   physics ensemble, as ensemble spread seems to be reduced. These findings
   could help to design the most appropriate ensemble strategies before
   these hydrometeorological extremes, given the computational cost of
   running such advanced HEPSs for operational purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, a genetic programming (GP) algorithm is introduced to
   solve the symbolic regression problem for flash flood risk zoning in
   Beijing. GP operates in simulation of biological revolution and can
   avoid arbitrariness in risk estimates. Herein, this revolutionary
   computing searched for an appropriate model to best fit the training
   samples which comprise the data fields of the predictand of Ripley's
   K-values to be the posterior risk, and the predictors of the rainstorm
   hazard index value (RHIV), physical vulnerability, terrain factor,
   impervious surface area, and population density. After generations of
   revolution, the optimal fit regressions for estimating the risk value
   were determined in the form of function (parse) trees. Also, the grid
   risk values were calculated using the deduced regression. The risk
   zoning map indicates that the risk values are higher in urban areas,
   which is reasonable in comparison with the distribution of historical
   flash flood events. With an explicit model structure, this symbolic
   regression manifests that the risk value is mainly determined by the
   RHIV and impervious land surface and is weakly correlated with the other
   risk factors, e.g., the physical vulnerability, the terrain factor, and
   population density. Our research demonstrates that GP in an artificial
   intelligence manner meets the needs of risk assessment in determining
   the optimal fit regressions and is a promising technique for future
   applications. Meanwhile, approaches are still available for improving
   the GP application in the risk assessment, e.g., considering the
   historical losses in posterior risk estimations and improvement in the
   sampling training data.}},

Abstract = {{Social impacts caused by floods and landslides in Portugal in the period
   of 1865-2010 are gathered in the DISASTER database. This database
   contains 1,902 hydro-geomorphologic cases that caused 1,248 fatalities
   (81\% and 19\% associated with floods and landslides, respectively). The
   use of the DISASTER database allowed for: (i) the analysis of the
   frequency and the temporal evolution of fatal floods and landslides;
   (ii) the analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of fatalities;
   (iii) the identification of the most deadly flood and landside types;
   (iv) the verification of gender tendencies in mortalities; and (v) the
   evaluation of individual and societal risk. The highest number of flood
   and landslide cases and related mortalities occurred in the period of
   1935-1969. After this period, the number of flood and landslide
   mortalities decreased, although landslide fatalities remained higher
   than those registered in the period of 1865-1934. The occurrence of
   flood fatalities was widespread in the country, with an important
   cluster in the Lisbon region and in the Tagus valley, while fatalities
   caused by landslides mainly occurred in the north of the Tagus valley.
   Flash floods caused the majority of fatalities associated with floods,
   while falls and flows were responsible for the highest number of
   fatalities associated with landslides. Males were found to have the
   highest frequency of fatalities. In the case of floods, the majority of
   fatalities were found both outdoors and inside of buildings in rural
   areas while fatalities inside buildings were dominant in landslide
   cases, mostly in rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{In April 2013, a 7.0 Mw earthquake struck in Lushan County, Sichuan
   Province, China, causing serious housing damage. Housing reconstruction
   is a crucial part of disaster recovery, and resident participation has
   been recognized as a key part of reconstruction success. This paper
   examined housing reconstruction resident participation in the
   post-Lushan earthquake period as a multi-stage problem based on
   multi-stakeholder collaborative perspectives, which covered emergency
   shelter, temporary housing and permanent housing stages. Multi-stage
   field research was conducted in the affected areas, and the residents
   were found to be fully involved in the reconstruction with a high medium
   high' distribution across the three stages. Resident participation
   experiences were summarized in terms of previous earthquake education,
   NGO participation and community-based organization functions, and the
   reasons discussed, such as civic awareness and civic rights. Problems
   regarding improper reconstruction and cultural conflicts were also
   examined and valuable suggestions given.}},

Abstract = {{Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) was introduced in the Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) to account for stress
   symptoms appearing within the first month after a trauma exposure.
   However, there is scant literature assessing the validity of models
   pertaining to ASD, particularly among Asian adolescent samples. This
   study aims to address this gap by examining the latent structure of five
   proposed models of ASD among adolescent survivors of a deadly flash
   flood. Two hundred twenty-five (225) respondents were assessed using the
   Acute Stress Disorder Interview within a month after a flash flood
   disaster. Series of confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a
   five-factor inter-correlated model (dissociation, intrusion, avoidance,
   dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal) yielded a more nuanced structure
   that portrays the subtleties in the data that are glossed over and
   missed by one-factor DSM-5 and even other multifactor models.}},

Abstract = {{In France, government and specific services (SCHAPI) survey overflow
   stream floods (100.000km(2)) but flash floods characterized by fast,
   quick and dangerous responses (other 100.000km(2)) remain delicate to
   predict and difficult to monitor. It's about to explore the conditions
   of establishment of a proactive and innovative alert system via
   smartphones, to cope the risks associated with flash floods. The
   solution must be thought in way to achieve a major challenge: reducing
   the gap between a state approach (TOP-DOWN), which positions and imposed
   the state as the main official alert source, and the citizen action
   (Bottum-UP) which establishes the individual as ``Citizen sensor{''}
   (both in go up or disseminate information) through the use of its
   smartphone. Addressing this challenge is indispensable if we hope
   effectively minimize material and human damages especially when high
   temporal acuity phenomena such as flash floods happen.
   Consequently, we propose to use Smartphone technologies: to reduce the
   time required to alert and to protect population; to enhance information
   observed by any people at local scales; to built automatic vigilance
   based on these ``citizens-sensors{''}; to use field experiment to
   improve knowledge on flash floods actually available after damaged
   events; to use geo-location of transmitter sources to alert people
   located at 5 km around.}},

Abstract = {{Nuweiba sits on a flood plain between the Sinai Mountain and the Gulf of
   Aqaba. Flash floods pose significant threats to socio-economic
   development in the region. This study assessed flash floods risk in the
   greater Nuweiba area in support of mitigation planning. Our approach
   evaluated topographic, hydrological, and geological factors holistically
   to rank areas of high, median, and low flash floods risk along the Wadi
   Watir. Data from field surveys, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery,
   and Shuttle Radar Terrain Model (SRTM) were analyzed through digital
   image processing and spatial analysis to characterize lithology, soil
   types, land cover, and hydrological morphometrics. The morphometric
   parameters were used to evaluate the most sensitive sub-basins for
   flooding and create the flash flood susceptibility map. Soil
   Conservation Service (SCS) Rainfall-Runoff model was used to estimate
   hydrological responses at ungauged catchments, including runoff depth,
   lag time, and peak discharge. We spatially integrated all the risk
   factors and created a flash floods risk map as the practical geospatial
   assessment of flash flood risk in the greater Nuweiba area. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The paper assesses the damage caused by 2010 flash flood and its
   underlying causes in the upper zone of Panjkora River within district
   Dir Upper, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province in Pakistan. Floods in
   general and flash floods in particular are very common in the area, and
   the phenomenon has intensified in the wake of observed climatic changes
   in the region. Anticipating an increase in the multiplicity of causes
   and a rise in the human, livelihood, and property losses attributed to
   flash floods calls for a detailed study of affected communities in the
   region. Within the study area of District Dir Upper-within the band of
   200 m on both sides of Panjkora River, three most affected communities,
   namely Barikot, Kalkot, and Sharingal, were picked on random basis to
   have detailed analysis of underlying causes and the quantification of
   damage assessment in the area. Questionnaire-based household survey and
   structured interviews were conducted to investigate physical and
   economic damages in the sample sites. Global positioning system (GPS)
   survey is also conducted to acquire absolute location of damages, and
   geographic information system is used to visualize land use, land cover,
   physical features, and GPS data. Monsoon winds interacted with the
   westerlies abnormally caused unprecedented high intensity rainfall in
   the valley. The steep topography of the area caused rainwater to
   accumulate rapidly in the Panjkora River channel, overpowering the
   withholding capacity of the river. The flash flood inflected heavy
   losses to life and properties of the local population. The
   infrastructure such as houses, roads, retaining walls, bridges, water
   supply schemes, and irrigation channels were destroyed severely in the
   whole area particularly in Kalkot. Three explored underlying causes of
   flash floods and the degree of damage due to 2010 flash floods in the
   region call for an enhanced realization for climatic change
   adaptability, flood risk management, and mitigation measures, better
   flood response through early warning systems, and improved
   rehabilitation and recovery efforts within flood prone areas such as
   district Dir Upper, KP, Pakistan.}},

Abstract = {{People entering floodwaters by vehicle constitutes a major cause of
   flood fatalities in Australia and globally. Over the 20 years to 2014,
   81 people have died attempting to drive through floodwaters. These
   comprise 43 per cent of all flood fatalities for this period. Despite
   Australian emergency services agencies mounting behavioural change
   campaigns and urging people not to enter floodwater, the behaviour
   persists. This paper draws on fieldwork carried out during flooding in
   the Shoalhaven region of NSW, Australia, in August 2015 to examine the
   effectiveness of the current combination of warnings, education and road
   signage to stop motorists entering floodwater. The fieldwork identified
   that 84 per cent of drivers at a monitored site, notably males and
   four-wheel-drive (4WD) vehicles, dismissed road closure signs and drove
   into floodwater. It is plain that further work is needed to reduce the
   frequency of motorists entering floodwater. This requires the
   development of a holistic approach including education, regulation and
   engineering measures.}},

   Implications for hazard assessment}},

Abstract = {{Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and related debris flows are among
   the most significant natural threats in the Tien Shan Mountains of
   Kyrgyzstan and have even caused the loss of life and damage to
   infrastructure in its capital Bishkek. An improved understanding of the
   occurrence of this process is essential so as to be able to design
   reliable disaster risk reduction strategies, even more so in view of
   ongoing climate change and scenarios of future evolutions. Here, we
   apply a dendrogeomorphic approach to reconstruct past debris-flow
   activity on the Aksay cone (Ala-Archa valley, Kyrgyz range), where
   outbursting glacier lakes and intense rainfalls have triggered huge
   debris flows over the past decades.
   A total of 96 Picea abies (L.) Karst. trees growing on the cone and
   along the main channel have been selected based on the evidence of past
   debris-flow damage in their trunks; these trees were then sampled using
   increment borers. The dating of past events was based on the assessment
   of growth disturbances (GD) in the tree-ring records and included the
   detection of injuries, tangential rows of traumatic resin ducts,
   reaction wood, and abrupt growth changes. In total, 320 GD were
   identified in the tree-ring samples. In combination with aerial imagery
   and geomorphic recognition in the field, reactions in trees and their
   position on the cone have allowed reconstruction of the main spatial
   patterns of past events on the Aksay cone.
   Our findings suggest that at least 27 debris flows have occurred on the
   site between 1877 and 2015 and point to the occurrence of at least 17
   events that were not documented prior to this study. We also observe
   high process activity during the 1950s and 1960s, with major events on
   the cone in 1950, 1966, and 1968, coinciding with phases of slight
   glacier advance. The spatial analyses of events also point to two
   different spatial patterns, suggesting that quite dissimilar magnitudes
   probably occurred during glacier lake outburst floods and rainfall
   induced debris-flow events. The results presented here represent the
   longest, annually resolved GLOF series in the region, which in turn has
   key implications on risk assessment, not just in the Ala-Archa valley,
   but also in the entire Kyrgyz range (northern Tien Shan). (C) 2016

Abstract = {{During the autumn of 2011 two catastrophic, very intense rainfall events
   affected two different parts of the Liguria Region of Italy causing
   various flash floods. The first occurred in October and the second at
   the beginning of November. Both the events were characterized by very
   high rainfall intensities (> 100 mm h(-1)) that persisted on a small
   portion of territory causing local huge rainfall accumulations (> 400 mm
   6 h(-1)).
   Two main considerations were made in order to set up this work. The
   first consideration is that various studies demonstrated that the two
   events had a similar genesis and similar triggering elements. The second
   very evident and coarse concern is that two main elements are needed to
   have a flash flood: a very intense and localized rainfall event and a
   catchment (or a group of catchments) to be affected. Starting from these
   assumptions we did the exercise of mixing the two flash flood
   ingredients by putting the rainfall field of the first event on the main
   catchment struck by the second event, which has its mouth in the biggest
   city of the Liguria Region: Genoa.
   A complete framework was set up to quantitatively carry out a ``what
   if{''} experiment with the aim of evaluating the possible damages
   associated with this event. A probabilistic rainfall downscaling model
   was used to generate possible rainfall scenarios maintaining the main
   characteristics of the observed rainfall fields while a hydrological
   model transformed these rainfall scenarios in streamflow scenarios. A
   subset of streamflow scenarios is then used as input to a 2-D hydraulic
   model to estimate the hazard maps, and finally a proper methodology is
   applied for damage estimation. This leads to the estimation of the
   potential economic losses and of the risk level for the people that stay
   in the affected area.
   The results are interesting, surprising and in a way worrying: a rare
   but not impossible event (it occurred about 50 km away from Genoa) would
   have caused huge damages estimated between 120 and EUR 230 million for
   the affected part of the city of Genoa, Italy, and more than 17 000
   potentially affected people.}},

Abstract = {{Problem: The close quartering and exposed living conditions in
   evacuation centres and the potential increase in vector density after
   flooding in Solomon Islands resulted in an increased risk of exposure
   for the occupants to vectorborne diseases.
   Context: In April 2014, Solomon Islands experienced a flash flooding
   event that affected many areas and displaced a large number of people.
   In the capital, Honiara, nearly 10 000 people were housed in emergency
   evacuation centres at the peak of the post-flood emergency. At the time
   of the floods, the number of dengue cases was increasing, following a
   record outbreak in 2013.
   Action: The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme with the
   assistance of the World Health Organization implemented an emergency
   vector-control response plan to provide protection to the at-risk
   populations in the evacuation centres. The National Surveillance Unit
   also activated an early warning disease surveillance system to monitor
   communicable diseases, including dengue and malaria.
   Outcome: Timely and strategic application of the emergency interventions
   probably prevented an increase in dengue and malaria cases in the
   affected areas.
   Discussion: Rapid and appropriate precautionary vector-control measures
   applied in a post-natural disaster setting can prevent and mitigate
   vectorborne disease incidences. Collecting vector surveillance data
   allows better analysis of vector-control operations' effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods cause more fatalities than any other weather-related
   natural hazard and cause significant damage to property and
   infrastructure. It is important to understand the underlying processes
   that lead to these infrequent but high-consequence events. Accurately
   determining the locations of flash flood events can be difficult, which
   impedes comprehensive research of the phenomena. While some flash floods
   can be detected by automated means (e.g., streamflow gauges), flash
   floods (and other severe weather events) are generally based on human
   observations and may not reflect the actual distribution of event
   locations. The Storm Data-Storm Events Database, which is produced from
   National Weather Service reports, was used to locate reported flash
   floods within the forecast area of the Binghamton, New York, Weather
   Forecast Office between 2007 and 2013. The distribution of those reports
   was analyzed as a function of environmental variables associated with
   flood generation including slope, impervious area, soil saturated
   hydraulic conductivity k(sat), representative rainfall intensity, and
   representative rainfall depth, as well as human population. A spatial
   conditional autoregressive model was used to test the hypothesis that
   flash flood reports are made more frequently in areas with higher
   populations, even when other flood-generating processes are considered.
   Slope, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, and impervious area are
   significant predictors of flash flood reports. When population is added
   as a predictor, the model is similarly robust, but impervious area and
   k(sat) are no longer significant predictors. These results may challenge
   the assumption that flash flood reports are strongly biased by
   population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper identifies the underlying causes and damages caused by 2010
   flash flood, which is considered one of the worst hydrological disasters
   in the country (Pakistan). Questionnaire based survey and structured
   interviews were conducted to investigate physical and economic damages
   in the selected case study Dir Valley. Global Positioning System (GPS)
   survey was also conducted to acquire location of damages and
   Geographical Information System (GIS) is used to visualize land use,
   land cover and damage data. Buffer analysis is used to delineate the
   effected strata on both sides of Panjkora River to assess the flood
   damages. Climate change phenomenon along with peculiar topography of the
   region are considered as the underlying causes as monsoon winds
   interacted with the jet stream abnormally causing unprecedented high
   intensity rainfall in the valley. The steep topography of the area
   caused rain water to accumulate rapidly in the Panjkora River,
   overpowering the withholding capacity of the river. The phenomenon
   resulted in severe flash flood which annihilated whatever came in its
   way. Upper zone in the target area is badly affected by flood with
   maximum damaged houses and human causalities followed by lower zone with
   high number of damaged bridges. This study will bring the attention of
   disaster management and other relevant authorities to focus on flood
   risk reduction by enhancing the retention capability of watershed in
   upstream areas that will reduce the risk in low lying areas. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Hydrological assessment is critical to the successful implementation of
   adaption measures. In this study, projections of seven global
   circulation models (GCMs) associated with high and medium-low
   Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5) for the
   period 2021-2040 and 2081-2100 were adopted to assess changes on runoffs
   in the Gilgel Abbay watershed, the upper Blue Nile basin. A weather
   generator was employed to generate daily temperature and precipitation
   to drive a hydrological model for impact assessment. Despite the
   projected magnitude of changes varied among different GCMs and RCPs,
   increasing runoffs in wet-season and decreasing in dry-season are
   observed in both periods, mainly attributed to the change in projected
   precipitation. Such changes are profound in cases of RCP 8.5 with
   respect to those of RCP 4.5 and in cases of 2081-2100 with respect to
   those of 2021-2040. Although the increasing runoffs would provide
   greater inflow to Lake Tana, the increase of precipitation in wet-season
   would imply a higher possibility of flash floods. On the other hand,
   decrease runoffs in dry-season further intensify existing shortage of
   irrigation water demand. These changes will have deleterious
   consequences on the economic wellbeing of the country and require
   successful implementation of adaption measures to reduce vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{Disasters caused by flash floods with casualties have occurred
   frequently in China in recent years. In order to effectively prevent and
   control them, the government initiated the project of building up a
   comprehensive nonstructural measure system in 103 pilot counties from
   2009. Based on the pilot experience, this project involved 2058 counties
   of 29 provinces and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corp from 2013.
   Analysis and evaluation of flash flood disaster is an important element
   task of this project. According to analyze the characteristics of
   rainstorm, basic parameters of the small watershed, social economy, the
   historical flood, etc. in the mountain areas possibly occur flash flood,
   this task aims to assess the flood control capacity of villages, towns
   and cities along the mountain rivers, declare the distribution of
   population and housings in the areas with different hazard grades,
   estimate the early-warning indexes such as rainfall and water level and
   their threshold values. The results can support and guide the warning
   system, forecasting, regional planning, land use and emergency response,
   and so on for flash flood disaster prevention. This paper will use a
   case of two small watersheds in Lingbao County of Henan Province to
   introduce the conceptual framework, methodology, process, key
   technology, rationality analysis and results of analysis and evaluation
   on flash flood disaster. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Journal = {{BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{415-427}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The rapid and ongoing expansion of urbanised impervious areas
   could lead to more frequent flood inundation in urban flood-prone
   regions. Nowadays, urban flood inundation induced by rainstorm is an
   expensive natural disaster in many countries. In order to reduce the
   flooding risk, eco-roof systems (or green roof systems) could be
   considered as an effective mechanism of mitigating flooding disasters
   through their rainwater retention capability. However, there is still a
   lack of examining the stormwater management tool. The purpose of this
   paper is to evaluate the effects on flooding disaster from extensive
   green roofs.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on geographical information system
   (GIS) simulation, this research presents a frame of assessing eco-roof
   impacts on urban flash floods. The approach addresses both urban
   rainfall-runoff and underground hydrologic models for traditional
   impervious and green roofs. Deakin University's Geelong Waurn Ponds
   campus is chosen as a study case. GIS technologies are then utilised to
   visualise and analyse the effects on flood inundation from surface
   properties of building roofs.
   Findings - The results reveal that the eco-roof systems generate varying
   degrees of mitigation of urban flood inundation with different return
   period storms.
   Originality/value - Although the eco-roof technology is considered as an
   effective stormwater management tool, it is not commonly adopted and
   examined in urban floods. This study will bring benefits to urban
   planners for raising awareness of hazard impacts and to construction
   technicians for considering disaster mitigation via roof technologies.
   The approach proposed here could be used for the disaster mitigation in
   future urban planning.}},

Abstract = {{The increased use of complex and holistic modelling for multi-hazard
   analysis is in sharp contrast with a lacuna in hazard analysis in
   equatorial Africa. This study aims to increase understanding of
   multi-hazard events in poorly documented regions with low accessibility.
   We focus on the Nyamwamba catchment (107 km(2)) located in the Rwenzori
   Mountains (Uganda) where on May 1, 2013, a severe flash flood occurred.
   In this region, wildfires, earthquakes and landslides occur as well.
   Here we reconstruct the circumstances under which this flash flood event
   was triggered, characterize the different processes acting upon the
   catchment dynamics and estimate the damaging effects of the flash flood
   within the catchment. The combined occurrence of intense rainfall, a
   forest fire having burned 18 \% of the catchment area and the occurrence
   of 29 landslides providing debris to the river system, induced a
   debris-rich and very destructive flash flood which caused several
   fatalities, the destruction of 70 buildings, several bridges, a
   hospital, a school, a tarmac road and several lifelines. Although the
   methodologies applied to estimate peak discharge, detect landslides and
   delineate wildfires are well established in their disciplines and
   sometimes limited in their precision, their combination is required to
   demonstrate the importance of the wildfire and landslides for the
   magnitude of this flood, unprecedented in decades but characterized by a
   low return period of the triggering rainfall event. This indicates that
   flash floods should not be considered as self-determined phenomena but
   as a result of several cascading and interacting hazard processes.}},

Abstract = {{In the framework of risk assessment for flash floods, vulnerability is a
   key concept to assess the susceptibility of elements at risk.
   Vulnerability is defined as expected degree of loss for an element at
   risk due to a hazard impact of a defined magnitude and frequency.
   Besides the increasing number of studies on flash floods available,
   in-depth information on vulnerability was missing so far. In order to
   close this gap, a vulnerability model was created for micro-sized
   enterprises exposed to flash floods in Greece. This model was based on a
   nonlinear regression approach using data from four different events. By
   means of bootstrapping, different functions were fitted to the data, and
   a modified Weibull distribution was found to represent the relationship
   between process magnitude and degree of loss best. Moreover, there is no
   need to distinguish between different business sectors when computing
   vulnerability for buildings exposed. The model can be applied on a local
   scale and may serve as a basis for flash flood risk management.}},

Abstract = {{East Coast Lows (ECLs) are intense low pressure systems that form
   several times a year off the east coast of Australia. When these systems
   occur close to land they can cause major damage to infrastructure and
   communities due to gale force winds, intense rainfall, storm surge and
   coastal erosion. In June 2007, Newcastle and Central Coast regions of
   New South Wales (NSW) experienced severe weather and subsequent flash
   flooding. The `Pasha Bulker' storm, as it has become known, was one of
   the most significant meteorological events in Australia's history, with
   large economic losses and social disruption due to the loss of critical
   infrastructure. This paper provides background information on the
   meteorology of the event, the impact of the Pasha Bulker storm and a
   discussion of the lessons learned from the event and subsequent
   adaptation strategies employed. The paper also provides important
   reflections, at both regional and national level, on the Pasha Bulker
   storm and other similar storm events. Lessons for all levels of
   government and community groups are discussed, including preparedness
   before the event, actions during the event, and recovery processes
   post-event. From this, recommendations and conclusions are made on
   actions and strategies to increase adaptive capacity and resilience to
   extreme weather events like ECLs.}},

Title = {{Distributed Stormwater Controls for Flood Mitigation within Urbanized
   Watersheds: Case Study of Rocky Branch Watershed in Columbia, South
   Carolina}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{For highly urbanized watersheds where space is limited, distributed low
   impact development (LID) stormwater controls could offer an effective
   retrofit to address flooding problems. The goal of this study is to
   determine the feasibility of using distributed LID controls within an
   urbanized watershed for flood mitigation. The Rocky Branch Watershed in
   Columbia, South Carolina, is an excellent case study because it
   experiences flash floods almost annually and has limited space for
   traditional, centralized stormwater controls to mitigate these floods.
   The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to model flooding with
   rain gardens as the LID approach for flood mitigation owing to their
   storage potential. The results of the study suggest that rain gardens
   with 30-cm berm heights and a total area equal to 20\% of the impervious
   surfaces within the watershed should provide sufficient storage to
   mitigate flooding for rain events up to and including a 10-year storm
   event. Once sufficient storage is available, the challenge is diverting
   runoff generated from impervious surfaces into rain gardens. The results
   of this study suggest approximately 15, 27, and 38\% of the runoff
   generated from impervious surfaces should be diverted to rain gardens to
   mitigate flooding from 2-, 5-, and 10-year storm events, respectively.
   Given prior work on the adoption of LID approaches for other watersheds,
   rain gardens could be effective at mitigating up to a 5-year storm event
   within the watershed, although further research on possible adoption
   rates in the study watershed is needed to more fully support this
   conclusion.}},

Title = {{Trends in flash flood events versus convective precipitation in the
   Mediterranean region: The case of Catalonia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{541}},
Number = {{A, SI}},
Pages = {{24-37}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential relationship between
   flash flood events and convective precipitation in Catalonia, as well as
   any related trends. The paper starts with an overview of flash floods
   and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their
   associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of,
   and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the
   paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is
   a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation
   from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996-2011) but more
   extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation.
   Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective
   contribution to rainfall, introducing the beta parameter as the ratio
   between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any
   period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA
   database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of
   finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood
   data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as
   a Multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been
   caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or
   exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events.
   The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values, of
   precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert
   Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point
   to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in
   land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was
   concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain
   this positive trend in flash flood events. The beta parameter has been
   also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the
   features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short
   and local events, usually with daily beta values above 0.5, while the
   minimum threshold of daily beta for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.

Abstract = {{Flash-floods are among the most devastating hazards in the
   Mediterranean. A major subset of damage and casualties caused by
   flooding is related to road submersion. Distributed hydrological
   nowcasting can be used for road flooding monitoring. This requires
   rainfall-runoff simulations at a high space and time resolution.
   Distributed hydrological models, such as the ISBA-TOP coupled system
   used in this study, are designed to simulate discharges for any
   cross-section of a river but they are generally calibrated for certain
   outlets and give deteriorated results for the sub-catchment outlets. The
   paper first analyses ISBA-TOP discharge simulations in the French
   Mediterranean region for target points different from the outlets used
   for calibration. The sensitivity of the model to its governing factors
   is examined to highlight the validity of results obtained for ungauged
   river sections compared with those obtained for the main gauged outlets.
   The use of improved model inputs is found beneficial for sub-catchments
   simulation. The calibration procedure however provides the parameters'
   values for the main outlets only and these choices influence the
   simulations for ungauged catchments or sub-catchments. As a result, a
   new version of ISBA-TOP system without any parameter to calibrate is
   used to produce diagnostics relevant for quantifying the risk of road
   submersion. A first diagnostic is the simulated runoff spatial
   distribution, it provides a useful information about areas with a high
   risk of submersion. Then an indicator of the flood severity is given by
   simulated discharges presented with respect to return periods. The
   latter has to be used together with information about the vulnerability
   of road-river cross-sections. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Damaging Hydrogeological Events (DHEs) are periods of severe weather
   conditions affecting wide areas for several days, and causing mainly
   damaging landslides and floods. In order to characterise the DHEs, we
   analysed the historical series of the events that affected a
   Mediterranean region (Calabria, southern Italy) throughout 92 years of
   observation. Depending on their magnitude, we classified the events as:
   major catastrophic, catastrophic, extraordinary and ordinary. In winter
   events, damaged areas and damage were greater than those resulting from
   the other seasons. Nevertheless, the majority of the events took place
   in autumn, when, in addition to landslides, a relevant percentage of
   flash floods and floods also occurred. Results also show that the
   frequency of major catastrophic and catastrophic events has decreased
   since 1971, and that, in recent decades, Calabria has suffered from
   damaging effects even though rain did not reached extreme
   characteristics. In fact, the duration of triggering rain, the maximum
   daily rain of the events and the out coming frequency of the high return
   period of rain show a decreasing pattern throughout the study period. As
   to what concerns the damaging phenomena, landslides were identified as
   the most frequent in every season and in every type of events, the
   eastern side of the region was the most frequently and heavily damaged.
   According to literature, the trend of number of victims per event is
   also decreasing.
   The proposed analysis can be applied to different study areas in order
   to assess the relative magnitude of DHEs and their evolution throughout
   the years. The classification criterion can be useful to compare
   different events for either scientific or insurance purposes, and to
   identify the typical rainfall-damage scenario of a study area. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is an analysis of building vulnerability through
   investigating impacts from the 8 February 2013 flash flood event along
   the Avenida Venezuela channel in the city of Arequipa, Peru. On this
   day, 124.5 mm of rain fell within 3 h (monthly mean: 29.3 mm) triggering
   a flash flood that inundated at least 0.4 km(2) of urban settlements
   along the channel, affecting more than 280 buildings, 23 of a total of
   53 bridges (pedestrian, vehicle and railway), and leading to the partial
   collapse of sections of the main road, paralyzing central parts of the
   city for more than one week.
   This study assesses the aspects of building design and site specific
   environmental characteristics that render a building vulnerable by
   considering the example of a flash flood event in February 2013. A
   statistical methodology is developed that enables estimation of damage
   probability for buildings. The applied method uses observed inundation
   height as a hazard proxy in areas where more detailed hydrodynamic
   modeling data is not available. Building design and site-specific
   environmental conditions determine the physical vulnerability. The
   mathematical approach considers both physical vulnerability and hazard
   related parameters and helps to reduce uncertainty in the determination
   of descriptive parameters, parameter interdependency and respective
   contributions to damage. This study aims to (1) enable the estimation of
   damage probability for a certain hazard intensity, and (2) obtain data
   to visualize variations in damage susceptibility for buildings in flood
   prone areas. Data collection is based on a post-flood event field survey
   and the analysis of high (sub-metric) spatial resolution images
   (Pleiades 2012, 2013). An inventory of 30 city blocks was collated in a
   GIS database in order to estimate the physical vulnerability of
   buildings. As many as 1103 buildings were surveyed along the affected
   drainage and 898 buildings were included in the statistical analysis.
   Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied to better characterize
   each vulnerability parameter. Multiple corresponding analyses revealed
   strong relationships between the ``Distance to channel or bridges{''},
   ``Structural building type{''}, ``Building footprint{''} and the
   observed damage. Logistic regression enabled quantification of the
   contribution of each explanatory parameter to potential damage, and
   determination of the significant parameters that express the damage
   susceptibility of a building. The model was applied 200 times on
   different calibration and validation data sets in order to examine
   performance. Results show that 90\% of these tests have a success rate
   of more than 67\%. Probabilities (at building scale) of experiencing
   different damage levels during a future event similar to the 8 February
   2013 flash flood are the major outcomes of this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The deadliest storm affecting Portugal since, at least, the early 19th
   century, took place on the 25 and 26 November 1967 causing more than 500
   fatalities. This work aims to assess the most relevant aspects of this
   episode. This includes describing the associated meteorological
   conditions and key hydrological characterisation such as the level of
   exceptionality of the observed precipitation at different temporal
   scales, or the estimation of peak discharge values in 20 small river
   catchments affected. Additionally, from a human impact perspective we
   provide a full account of all the main socio-economic impacts,
   particularly the numbers and location of victims (dead, injured,
   homeless and evacuated).
   Based on the sub-daily time series of a representative station, and its
   Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves, we have found that the
   exceptionality of this rainfall event is particularly linked to rainfall
   intensities ranging in duration from 4 to 9 h compatible with return
   periods of 100-years or more. This range of time scale which are similar
   to the estimated concentration time values of the hydrographic basins
   affected by the flash flood event. From a meteorological perspective,
   this episode was characterised by strong convection at the regional
   scale, fuelled by high availability of moisture over the Lisbon region
   associated with a low pressure system centered near Lisbon that favoured
   the convective instability.
   Most victims were sleeping or were caught by surprise at home in the
   small river catchments around the main Lisbon metropolitan area. The
   majority of people who died or who were severely affected by the flood
   lived in degraded housing conditions often raised in a clandestine way,
   occupying flood plains near the stream beds. This level of destruction
   observed at the time is in stark contrast to what was observed in
   subsequent episodes of similar amplitude. In particular, since 1967 the
   Lisbon area, was struck by two comparable intense precipitation events
   in 1983 and 2008 but generating considerably fewer deaths and evacuated
   people. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the
   floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River.
   Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its
   upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable
   lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River
   overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to
   homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013
   and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify
   the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas.
   Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood
   frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and
   characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling
   (Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering
   three different scenarios associated with the initial construction
   (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure
   (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population.
   Specific stage-damage functions were expressly developed using in situ
   data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on
   urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit
   value were established. The relationship between water depth and the
   height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were
   located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function.
   Other nonspecific magnitude-damage functions were used in order to
   compare both economic estimates.
   The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude-damage
   functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses,
   partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a
   detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is
   the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial
   losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the
   socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well
   as the types of flood that affect it. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper aims at exploring the anticipation phase before a flash
   flood, corresponding to the time between the first climatic signs and
   the peak-flow. We focus the analysis on people's behaviors observing how
   they use this period to organize themselves for facing the event. The
   analysis is made through the definition of three specific scales: the
   timeliness scale, an analytical scale of anticipatory actions and the
   scale of human response network. Using a cross-scale and cross level
   analysis enables to define different phases in the anticipation period
   where different kind of environmental precursors are mobilized by the
   actors in order to make sense of the situation and adapt. Three main
   points deserve attention at the end: firstly, the concepts of
   timeliness, anticipatory actions and crisis network scales enable to
   understand differently what happens both physically and socially during
   an extreme event; secondly, analyzing the precursors shows that each
   level of crisis network uses different kinds of signs for estimating the
   situation, organizing and reacting; thirdly, there is a potential for
   improvement in observation on both social and physical processes at
   different scales, for verifying the theory of the anticipatory phases.

Title = {{Assessment of commuters' daily exposure to flash flooding over the roads
   of the Gard region, France}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{541}},
Number = {{A, SI}},
Pages = {{636-648}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods are responsible for a majority of natural disaster
   fatalities in the USA and Europe and most of them are vehicle-related.
   If human exposure to flood is generally assessed through the number of
   inhabitants per buildings located in flood prone zone, it is clear that
   this number varies dramatically throughout the day as people move from
   place to place to follow their daily program of activities. Knowing the
   number of motorists exposed on flood prone road sections or the factors
   determining their exposure would allow providing a more realistic
   evaluation of the degree of exposure. In order to bridge this gap and
   provide emergency managers with methods to assess the risk level for
   motorists, this paper describes two methods, a simple rough-and-ready
   estimate and a traffic attribution method, and applies both of them on
   datasets of the Gard departement, an administrative region of Southern
   France with about 700000 inhabitants over 5875 km(2). The first method
   to obtain an overall estimation of motorists flood exposure is to
   combine (i) the regional density of roads and rivers to derive a count
   of potential road cuts and (ii) the average daily kilometers driven by
   commuters of the study area to derive the number of people passing these
   potential cuts. If useful as a first approximation, this method fails to
   capture the spatial heterogeneities introduced by the geometry of river
   and road networks and the distribution of commuters' itineraries. To
   address this point, this paper (i) uses a pre-established detailed
   identification of road cuts (Naulin et al., 2013) and (ii) applies a
   well-known traffic attribution method to existing and freely available
   census datasets.
   Both methods indicate that commuters' exposure is much larger than the
   number of commuters itself, illustrating the risk amplification effect
   of mobility. Comparing the results from both methods shows that (i) the
   road network geometry plays a significant role in reducing the risk of
   river-road dangerous intersections and (ii) not all commuters are
   equally exposed. Evidently commuters who have longer routes are more
   exposed, but residents of rural municipalities as well as professionals
   with highly qualified jobs are also more exposed. Finally, these
   exposure assessment methods applied to the Gard area allows locating
   road sections where commuters' exposure to flood is high. It also sets
   the first step toward the implementation of a modeling platform able to
   combine the estimation of daily travel patterns exposure and behavioral
   response of motorists to road flooding, a critical input for emergency
   services and services in charge of the management of road networks in
   flash flood prone areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates flash flood forecast and warning communication,
   interpretation, and decision making, using data from a survey of 418
   members of the public in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Respondents to the
   public survey varied in their perceptions and understandings of flash
   flood risks in Boulder, and some had misconceptions about flash flood
   risks, such as the safety of crossing fast-flowing water. About 6\% of
   respondents indicated consistent reversals of US watch-warning alert
   terminology. However, more in-depth analysis illustrates the
   multi-dimensional, situationally dependent meanings of flash flood
   alerts, as well as the importance of evaluating interpretation and use
   of warning information along with alert terminology. Some public
   respondents estimated low likelihoods of flash flooding given a flash
   flood warning; these were associated with lower anticipated likelihood
   of taking protective action given a warning. Protective action
   intentions were also lower among respondents who had less trust in flash
   flood warnings, those who had not made prior preparations for flash
   flooding, and those who believed themselves to be safer from flash
   flooding. Additional analysis, using open-ended survey questions about
   responses to warnings, elucidates the complex, contextual nature of
   protective decision making during flash flood threats. These findings
   suggest that warnings can play an important role not only by notifying
   people that there is a threat and helping motivate people to take
   protective action, but also by helping people evaluate what actions to
   take given their situation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In urban areas prone to flash floods, characterization of social
   resilience is critical to guarantee the success of emergency management
   plans. In this study, we present the methodological approach that led to
   the submission and subsequent approval of the Civil Protection Plan of
   Navaluenga (Central Spain), in which the first phase was to analyse
   flood hazard by combining the Hydrological Modelling System (HEC-HMS)
   and the Iber 2D hydrodynamic model. We then analysed social
   vulnerability and designed measures to put into practice within the
   framework of the Civil Protection Plan. At a later phase, we assessed
   citizens' flash-flood risk perception and level of awareness regarding
   some key variables of the Civil Protection Plan. To this end, 254 adults
   representing roughly 12\% of the population census were interviewed.
   Responses were analysed descriptively, comparing awareness regarding
   preparedness and response actions with the corresponding information and
   behaviours previously defined in the Civil Protection Plan. In addition,
   we carried out a latent class cluster analysis aimed at identifying the
   different groups present among the interviewees. Our results showed that
   risk perception is low. Specifically, 60.8\% of the interviewees showed
   low risk perception and low awareness (cluster 1); 24.4\% had high risk
   perception and low awareness (cluster 2), while the remaining 14.8\%
   presented high long-term risk perception and high awareness (cluster 3).
   These findings suggest the need for integrating these key variables of
   social risk perception and local tailored information in emergency
   management plans, especially in urban areas prone to flash-floods where
   response times are limited. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Tropical Storm Washi (locally known as Sendong) hit the major cities
   in the region of Northern Mindanao in Southern Philippines between
   December 16th and 17th, 2011. The flash floods brought by Washi resulted
   in a massive and unprecedented destruction of urban areas, causing, only
   in Cagayan de Oro, the displacement of 228,576 persons that represents
   almost 40\% of the total city population, 5,801 houses were totally
   destroyed and 12,635 were partially damaged. Approximately 85\% of the
   affected households were informal settlers of highly vulnerable and
   marginal areas located near the river banks. As a result, the
   post-disaster housing recovery projects focused on the resettlement of
   these communities as a priority for permanent housing.
   In the following month of the disaster, the government announced an
   ambitious resettlement project to build more than 8,500 houses in safer
   locations. The project implies a complex process in which each
   stakeholder has specific roles, responsibilities, and approaches.
   Therefore, the success of the project depends on a large extent of the
   relationships among stakeholders, leadership and the decisions taken
   independently by each stakeholder who in turn is affected by other
   stakeholders' decisions. This research examines the coordination
   mechanisms, criteria for decision making and the complex interactions
   among the different stakeholders involved in the housing reconstruction
   in Cagayan de Oro in the aftermath of Washi for a better understanding
   of the process which is needed for an effective management of the
   resettlement projects. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme hydrometeorological events such as flash floods have caused
   considerable loss of life and damage to infrastructure over recent
   years. Flood events in the Mediterranean region between 1990 and 2006
   caused over 4,500 fatalities and cost over (sic)29 billion in damage,
   with Italy one of the worst affected countries. The Distributed
   Computing Infrastructure for Hydro-Meteorology (DRIHM) project is a
   European initiative aiming at providing an open, fully integrated
   eScience environment for predicting, managing, and mitigating the risks
   related to such extreme weather phenomena. Incorporating both modeled
   and observational data sources, it enables seamless access to a set of
   computing resources with the objective of providing a collection of
   services for performing experiments with numerical models in
   meteorology, hydrology, and hydraulics. The purpose of this article is
   to demonstrate how this flexible modeling architecture has been
   constructed using a set of standards including the NetCDF and WaterML2
   file formats, in-memory coupling with OpenMI, controlled vocabularies
   such as CF Standard Names, ISO19139 metadata, and a Model MAP (Metadata,
   Adaptors, Portability) gateway concept for preparing numerical models
   for standardized use. Hydraulic results, including the impact to
   buildings and hazards to people, are given for the use cases of the
   severe and fatal flash floods, which occurred in Genoa, Italy in
   November 2011 and October 2014.}},

Abstract = {{Many floodplains are excluded from urban development because the floods
   cause considerable damage to people's lives and properties. This
   requires the development of new approaches to flood management and
   mitigation for support sustainable urban development. In present study
   as the measures for mitigation of flash floods, the regulation of river
   flow by the system of detention reservoirs for flood diversion with
   dams, which do not need any operation management, are analyzed
   concerning of Far East region of Russia. The main objective of this
   paper is to develop a method for analysis how the dam site selection
   meets the environmental criterion. The method to justify a selection of
   self-regulated flood dam parameters, primarily a height of a dam and its
   location on a water stream, providing minimization of impact on the
   environment have been developed. The result for Selemdzha river basin in
   Far East monsoon region of Russian Federation is analyzed. The result
   shows the robustness of the method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper had a primary task, namely ``Proposal of a methodology for
   the process of preliminary assessment of flood risk a methodological
   procedure for preliminary flood risk assessment from flash floods with
   respect to the need for its updating following from directive 2007/60/EC
   and its application in the conditions of a modelled territory{''}. The
   methods which are used in the contribution emerge from practical
   experience as well as from knowledge obtained from the available
   literature and consultations with experts dealing with the given problem
   in practice. The foundations of flood risk assessment are hypotheses on
   the impact of physiogcographical attributes of basins on the origin of
   floods. The conceptual framework for flood risk assessment of flash
   floods comes from the definition of a multidimensional conception of
   flood risk. The proposed methodology consists in the identification of
   critical points and contributing surfaces from the viewpoint of creation
   of a concentrated surface flow from flash floods and their adverse
   impacts on the built-up areas of a municipality. The primary goal of the
   assessment of risk of contributing surfaces was determining the
   riskiness of the locality with an ordinal degree (i.e., low, moderate,
   and high) and providing a foundation for a second stage, called
   controlling risk. The resulting risk of contributing surfaces is
   determined as a combination of danger and vulnerability according to a
   set matrix. Processing and analysis of the input data as well as
   visualization of the achieved results is carried out in the GIS
   environment (ArcGIS 9.3, 10) in integration with a spreadsheet of
   Microsoft Excel. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, hazardous flash flooding has caused human deaths and
   damages to urban infrastructures in Saudi Arabian cities. This study has
   computed, mapped, and analyzed the physical vulnerability, social
   vulnerability, and overall composite flash flood vulnerability (CFVI)
   indices using a simulated flood and 2006 census data on seven social
   variables for 153 neighborhoods of the City of Riyadh, the capital of
   the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The physical vulnerability index was
   computed by ranking a potential flood depth map created by simulating a
   6 h of high-intense rainfall in the city. The social vulnerability index
   was constructed by standardizing the social data variables. Finally, the
   two indices were multiplied to create the CFVI. The CFVI map revealed
   that the low-lying central and southern half of the city is highly
   vulnerable; northern and northeastern peripheral neighborhoods are
   moderately to highly vulnerable; and the mountainous western
   neighborhoods are the least vulnerable to flash flooding. Low-income and
   unemployed expatriate families living in densely populated central,
   south, and southeastern neighborhoods are more vulnerable to flooding
   than rich Saudi families living in the sparsely populated northern half
   of the central city, western, northwestern, and southwestern
   neighborhoods. The CFVI map will help city planners to formulate
   effective flood control measures to protect the city residents and urban
   infrastructures from future flood damage. This flood vulnerability
   research can be expanded to other Saudi cities by incorporating more
   physical and social variables.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents the results of analyzing the use of dispersed
   storage tanks as a low impact development (LID) alternative to mitigate
   the flash flood risk in consolidated urban watersheds in Barranquilla,
   Colombia. Fieldwork, rainfall and flow rate monitoring, and numerical
   modeling were conducted to evaluate different scenarios combining
   storage tank capacity, two types of storage operations, and different
   locations by land use and watershed sectoring. These results showed that
   it is possible to reduce significantly the peak flow with small-capacity
   tanks distributed in the urban watershed with hydraulic structures that
   divide the discharge during the peak-flow time interval. By storing
   3-17\% of the runoff volume, equivalent to a dispersed storage capacity
   from 4 to 19 mm rainfall, it is possible to reduce the peak flow from 25
   to 75\%. These results demonstrate the advantages of using low impact
   development for stormwater management in consolidated cities with
   limited space, if regulatory policies encourage the massive use of LID
   in existing buildings. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes
   affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have
   consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the
   type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability
   conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of
   landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and
   landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal
   scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on
   landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and
   find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the
   world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in
   Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the
   approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on
   landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods
   that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in
   temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct
   and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a
   probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide
   changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of
   landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the
   Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate
   variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope
   processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based
   on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from
   worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and
   risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide
   projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and
   the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future
   landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of
   climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming
   is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall
   events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many
   landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people
   exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for
   landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a
   warming climate. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the description of the flooding event occurred in
   the surroundings of Benevento (Campania) between 14th and 15th October
   2015. Several agricultural and industrial activities were strongly
   affected by the flooding of the Calore River and by the reactivation of
   some alluvial fans in the northern piedmont of Mt. Camposauro. The
   geological and geomorphological survey carried out in the post-event,
   supported by satellite images allowed for assessing the width, the
   magnitude and the damages occurred. The analysis of the rain data
   displayed very high values of maximum sub-hourly intensity, mainly
   concentrated on some sectors of Taburno-Camposauro Mts. The event
   resulted in no casualties, but it heavily affected the local economy,
   mainly based on the agriculture and the wine production.}},

Abstract = {{The study examined and compared the latent structure of posttraumatic
   growth (PTG) based on three proposed models: 1-factor, 3-factor and
   5-factor models in order to (1) find out the factor structure that has
   the best fit for the Filipino sample; (2) find out the factor structure
   that best represents PTG in the immediate aftermath of a flash flood
   disaster; and (3) examine the generalizability of the best-fitted model
   across gender. A sample of 895 survivor-respondents answered the
   Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) within a month after a deadly
   flash flood. Based on the best-fitted model, a multi-group comparison
   between male and female was conducted to determine gender
   generalizability. Results showed that the 3-factor model comprising of
   Changes in Self/Positive Life Attitudes, Philosophy of Life, and
   Relating to Others fitted best in contrast to the other two models. The
   data also demonstrated the generalizability of the 3-factor model across
   gender, with invariance in factor loadings, item intercepts, factor
   variance and covariance, and factor means.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of flood management as well as the entire management
   cycle is regulated by Directive of the European Parliament and of the
   Council 2007/60/EC on the assessment and management of flood risks. The
   paper deals with an application of preliminary flood risk assessment,
   particularly flood risk assessment from flash floods in the Bodva river
   basin, which is situated in the south of the Slovak Republic. The aim of
   the preliminary assessment of flood risk from flash floods is
   determining the hazard and the vulnerability of assessed area. The
   result of identification of a hazard is the determination of critical
   points in the basin and their contributing surfaces on the basis of the
   geometric and physiogeographic characteristics of the contributing
   surfaces. Vulnerability in the study area is determined on the basis of
   the type and density of the built-up area. The resulting flood risk is
   stated as a moderate risk. The scope and extremity of flood episodes
   point to the need to build a comprehensive system of flood protection
   measures in potential flood areas.}},

Abstract = {{A moderate rainfall event can lead to harsh flash floods in most of the
   compact cities. Present urbanization happening in these cities creates
   an imbalance between generated urban runoff volume and effective
   drainage capacity. For the survival of these, it is vital in enhancing
   the efficiency of an urban drainage system. However, it is a complicated
   task due to the accumulation of solid waste in drainage channels. These
   drainage systems are super sensitive to some external factors caused by
   their immediate surroundings. This study found out the impact of the
   urban form, population agglomeration, floating population, imminent
   prone areas of urban sprawl and waste disposing patterns of settlers can
   be highly influenced to the efficiency of a storm drainage system.
   Hence, Geographical Information System based computational techniques
   and weighted fussy sets are being used to track the attention need areas
   of the system. These particular zones to be treated through the design
   of ``Smart Storm Drainage Unit{''}. By this, it is expected to maintain
   a clear drainage channel for transportation of surface runoff all the
   time. Thus, by Smart Storm Drainage will be fixed into the breakdown
   areas or highly sensitive areas of a drainage system. This paper
   discusses the impact of surrounding urban area to the breakdown of
   drainage system and fixates the problem by bypassing ``Smart Storm
   Drainage Unit{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on disaster risk reduction primarily centers on the research
   streams of vulnerability and resilience. The concept of adaptive
   capacity is central to both streams of study and has profound
   implications for disaster risk reduction. Drawing insights from both
   streams, we examined the adaptive capacity of wetland communities with
   regards to flash flood disasters. Focusing on societal dimensions, we
   investigated how the interplay of institutions, community power
   structures, and human agency shape adaptive capacity of wetland
   communities. We employed the ``dominant-less dominant{''} research
   methodological framework, and followed a 4-tier study design: i) a
   household survey, ii) a semi-structured questionnaire survey, iii) oral
   history interviews, and iv) key informant interviews. Our findings
   revealed that wetland communities in the region are highly vulnerable to
   flash flood hazards. Local community members were conditioned, chiefly
   by the asymmetrical social power structure, to feel helpless in the face
   of natural disasters. Their reactive recovery measures have resulted in
   maladaptation and in their becoming passive towards risk mitigation for
   future floods. However, transformative patterns were also observed in a
   large proportion of the population, wherein community members modified
   or changed their behavior to achieve longer-term sustainability and risk
   mitigation. We concluded that in designing development interventions to
   enhance adaptive capacity, consideration must be given to the diverse
   range of skills and educational development among the local population.

Abstract = {{Whilst policy makers have tended to adopt an Information-deficit model'
   to bolster levels of flood-risk preparedness primarily though
   communication strategies promoting awareness, the assumed causal
   relation between awareness and preparedness is empirically weak. As
   such, there is a growing interest amongst scholars and policy makers
   alike to better understand why at-risk individuals are underprepared. In
   this vein, empirical studies, typically employing quantitative methods,
   have tended to focus on exploring the extent to which flood-risk
   preparedness levels vary depending not only on sociodemographic
   variables, but also (and increasingly so) the perceptual factors that
   influence flood risk preparedness. This study builds upon and extends
   this body of research by offering a more solution-focused approach that
   seeks to identify how pathways to flood-risk preparedness can be opened
   up. Specifically, through application of a qualitative methodology, we
   seek to explore how the factors that negatively influence flood-risk
   preparedness can be addressed to foster a shift towards greater levels
   of mitigation behaviour. In doing so, we focus our analysis on an urban
   community in Ireland that is identified as `at risk' of flash flooding
   and is currently undergoing significant flood relief works. In this
   regard, the case study offers an interesting laboratory to explore how
   attitudes towards flood-risk preparedness at the individual level are
   being influenced within the context of a flood relief scheme that is
   only partially constructed. In order to redress the dearth of
   theoretically informed qualitative studies in this field, we draw on
   Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to help guide our analysis and make
   sense of our results. Our findings demonstrate that flood-risk
   preparedness can be undermined by low levels of efficacy amongst
   individuals in terms of the preparedness measures available to them and
   their own personal capacity to implement them. We also elucidate that
   the `levee effect' can occur before engineered flood defences are fully
   constructed as the flood relief works within our case study are
   beginning to affect people's perception of flood risk in the case study
   area. We conclude by arguing that (1) individuals' coping appraisals
   need to be enhanced through communication strategies and other
   interventions which highlight that future floods may not replicate past
   events; and (2) the concept of residual risk needs to be communicated at
   all stages of a flood relief scheme, not just upon completion. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In this paper, a 1: 5000 map of the geomorphic consequences of the
   14th-15th October 2015 flash flood is presented. The most severely
   affected area (about 13 km(2)) was located at the footslope of Mt.
   Camposauro (Southern Italy), between the municipalities of Solopaca and
   Paupisi. In this area high-intensity and very localized cloudbursts of
   short duration induced hillslope erosion and sediment delivery from the
   slopes to the Calore River, activating several alluvial fans. The
   rainstorm lasted 7 h with a maximum recorded rainfall peak of nearly 140
   mm in 2 h. The event map resulting from a geological and
   geomorphological post-event field survey was supported by satellite
   images and unmanned aerial vehicle image interpretations, respectively
   taken one day and one week after the event. The flash flood resulted in
   no casualties but severely affected the local economy, mainly based on
   agriculture and wine production.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the Free State of Saxony (Eastern Germany) was
   repeatedly hit by both extensive riverine flooding, as well as flash
   flood events, emerging foremost from convective heavy rainfall.
   Especially after a couple of small-scale, yet disastrous events in 2010,
   preconditions, drivers, and methods for deriving flash flood related
   early warning products are investigated. This is to clarify the
   feasibility and the limits of envisaged early warning procedures for
   small catchments, hit by flashy heavy rain events. Early warning about
   potentially flash flood prone situations (i.e., with a suitable lead
   time with regard to required reaction-time needs of the stakeholders
   involved in flood risk management) needs to take into account not only
   hydrological, but also meteorological, as well as communication issues.
   Therefore, we propose a threefold methodology to identify potential
   benefits and limitations in a real-world warning/reaction context.
   First, the user demands (with respect to desired/required warning
   products, preparation times, etc.) are investigated. Second, focusing on
   small catchments of some hundred square kilometers, two quantitative
   precipitation forecasts are verified. Third, considering the user needs,
   as well as the input parameter uncertainty (i.e., foremost emerging from
   an uncertain QPF), a feasible, yet robust hydrological modeling approach
   is proposed on the basis of pilot studies, employing deterministic,
   data-driven, and simple scoring methods.}},

Abstract = {{Unexpected flash flooding is one of the periodic hydrological problems
   affecting the city of Tabuk in Saudi Arabia. The region has high
   potential for floods as it suffers high rainfall intensity in a short
   time and also has high urbanization rates and topographic complexity.
   Constructing flood prevention dams is one option to solve this problem.
   A cost-effective design requires a detailed feasibility study and
   analysis for the selection of suitable sites. The aim of this study was
   to develop a method for selecting a suitable site for flood protection
   dams in the Abu Saba'a district, the most affected part of the city of
   Tabuk during the flash flood in January 2013. Spatial analysis was
   applied using Landsat Thematic Mapper images and Shuttle Radar
   Topography Mission digital elevation model to select a site in the Abu
   Saba'a area. A simple model using ArcGIS was built including all
   suggested parameters. The results showed the best site for a dam was 2
   km distance backfrom the area, where all parameter values matched. The
   results showed that the dynamic properties of land cover can affect site
   selection. It is therefore suggested that more field and hydrological
   data should be gathered for greater accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{In an attempt to do a back analysis of the damages caused to a
   nineteenth century masonry structure due to the October 2009 flash
   flood/debris flow event in Scaletta Zanclea, the flood discharge
   hydrograph is reconstructed in the ungauged conditions. The hydrograph
   for the solid discharge is then estimated by scaling up the liquid
   volume to the estimated debris volume. The debris flow diffusion is
   simulated by solving the differential equations for a single-phase 2D
   flow employing triangular mesh elements, taking into account also the
   channelling of the flow through the buildings. The damage to the
   building is modelled, based on the maximum hydraulic actions caused by
   the debris flow, using 2D finite shell elements to model the building,
   boundary conditions provided by the openings, floor slab, orthogonal
   wall panels, and the foundation. The reconstruction of the event and the
   damages to the case-study building confirms the location of the damages
   induced by the event.}},

Abstract = {{The dreadful floods of 1999, 2002 and 2003 in South of France have
   alerted public opinion on the need for a more efficient and a further
   generalized national flood-forecasting system. This is why in 2003
   Irstea and Meteo-France have implemented a new warning method for flash
   floods, including on small watersheds, using radar rainfall data in
   real-time: the AIGA method. This modelling method currently provides
   real-time information on the magnitude of floods, but doesn't take into
   account the elements at risk surrounding the river streams. Its benefit
   for crisis management is therefore limited as it doesn't give
   information on the actual flood risk. To improve the relevance of the
   AIGA method, this paper shows the benefits of the combination of
   hydrological warnings with an exposure index, to be able to assess the
   risk of flood-related damage in real time. To complete this aim, this
   work presents an innovative and easily reproducible method to evaluate
   exposure to floods over large areas with simple land-use data. For
   validation purpose, a damage database has been implemented to test the
   relevance of both AIGA warnings and exposure levels. A case study on the
   floods of the 3rd October 2015 is presented to test the effectiveness of
   the combination of hazard and exposure to assess the risk of
   flood-related damage. This combination seems to give an accurate
   overview of the streams at risk, where the most important amount of
   damage has been observed after the flood.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 25 years, flash floods in the South of France have killed
   almost 250 people. The protection of prone populations is a priority for
   the French government. It is also a goal of the 2007 European flood
   directive. However, no accurate database exists gathering the fatalities
   due to floods in France. Fatalities are supposed to be rare and
   hazardous, mainly due to individual behaviour. A Ph. D. work has
   initiated the building of a database gathering a detailed analysis of
   the circumstances of death and the profiles of the deceased (age,
   gender...). The study area covers the French Mediterranean departments
   prone to flash floods over the period 1988-2015. This presentation
   details the main features of the sample, 244 fatalities collected
   through newspapers completed with field surveys near police services and
   municipalities. The sample is broken down between huge events that
   account for two thirds of the fatalities and ``small{''} events (34 \%
   of the fatalities). Deaths at home account for 35 \% of the total number
   of fatalities, mainly during huge events. 30 \% of fatalities are
   related to vehicles. The last part of the work explains the relations
   between fatalities and prevention and how better knowledge of
   flood-related deaths can help to improve flood prevention. The given
   example shows the relationship between flood forecasting and fatalities.
   Half of the deaths took place in a small watershed (< 150 km(2)). It
   emphasizes the need for the dissemination of a complementary system of
   flash flood forecast based on forecasted rainfall depth and adapted to
   small watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{In France, flooding is the leading cause of mortality due to natural
   disasters and cause very significant economic damage. The question of
   risk forgetting has been identified as one of the key issues to reduce
   these negative consequences of flooding. There is need to study this
   oversight of risk on a long term basis, long after the event takes place
   and when routines are re-established. This is the challenge faced by the
   ethnographic dissertation summarized in this article: understanding the
   mechanisms of risk forgetting by investigating how the issue of flooding
   occurs in everyday life. The dissertation questions what circulates
   about flooding between inhabitants and how they organize their practices
   in relation to the risk. The field of study is a french suburban city
   which was built on wetlands and remains vulnerable to flash floods. This
   case study provides insight into the collective mechanisms from
   invisible danger implementation. The increased visibility of the
   protection made by local policies and the comforting effect of normative
   sharing provided a normalization of the trust in the protection. Through
   the interactions, statements are continually developed in the interests
   of their acceptability: statements of relativism circulate more than the
   ones that open on the horizon of danger. Moreover, the current
   development of a logic of safety for social risks reduction contradicts
   the prevention of flooding. Above all, neither the links between
   inhabitants nor the links with their living environment provide a
   sufficient collective development base for a risk culture deployment.}},

Abstract = {{The new policy of flood risk management is to give more attention to
   non-structural measures, allowing people to ``live with floods{''}
   rather than ``fight floods{''}. To protect existing buildings there are
   two main mitigation strategies: dry proofing and wet proofing. One
   measure of dry proofing is the shielding, consisting in the use of flood
   barriers, which can be installed at the entrance of the buildings or at
   a certain distance from them (including the placing along the banks or
   crossing a street). These flood protection structures are easier and
   faster to install rather than sandbags. This paper shows the results
   applied to a case study in the city of Barcellona, Sicily, Italy that is
   crossed by a river and suffered a severe inundation in November 2011. To
   study the effectiveness of using these flood barriers, a 2D hydrodynamic
   model has been used: the barriers has been placed along a road to
   inhibit the flow from flooding the protected area. While in North Europe
   these types of barriers are commonly used, because those areas are
   typically interested in clear water floods, in Italy flash floods and
   mud-debris-flows are more frequent and limit their use. The purpose of
   this work is to verify if these types of barriers are effective when
   placed along Mediterranean river courses and, especially, to be sure
   about their stability while subjected to the hydrodynamic effects of
   these kind of events. To gain this aim, the computed stresses from the
   modelling have been compared with the stability values of the barriers
   provided by the producers, evaluating barriers' stability against
   overturning and sliding. Simulations show how the flood barriers can
   mitigate the hydraulic risk, being able to withstand the hydrodynamic
   pressures and managing to divert the flow of water, thus avoiding that
   the flood water hits very exposed areas.}},

Abstract = {{Occurring at small temporal and spatial scales, flash floods (FF) can
   cause severe economic damages and human losses. To better anticipate
   such events and mitigate their impacts, the French Ministry in charge of
   Ecology has decided to set up a national FF warning system over the
   French territory. This automated system will be run by the SCHAPI, the
   French national service in charge of flood forecasting, providing
   warnings for fast-responding ungauged catchments (area ranging from
   similar to 10 to similar to 1000 km(2)). It will therefore be
   complementary to the SCHAPI's national ``vigilance{''} system which
   concerns only gauged catchments. The FF warning system to be implemented
   in 2017 will be based on a discharge-threshold flood warning method
   called AIGA (Javelle et al. 2014). This method has been experimented in
   real time in the south of France in the RHYTMME project
   (http://rhytmme.irstea.fr). It consists in comparing discharges
   generated by a simple conceptual hourly hydrologic model run at a
   1-km(2) resolution to reference flood quantiles of different (e.g., 2-,
   10- and 50-year) return periods. Therefore the system characterizes in
   real time the severity of ongoing events by the range of the return
   period estimated by AIGA at any point along the river network. The
   hydrologic model ingests operational rainfall radar-gauge products from
   Meteo-France and takes into account the baseflow and the initial soil
   humidity conditions to better estimate the basin response to rainfall
   inputs. To meet the requirements of the future FF warning system, the
   AIGA method has been extended to the whole French territory (except
   Corsica and overseas French territories). The calibration,
   regionalization and validation procedures of the hydrologic model were
   carried out using data for similar to 700 hydrometric stations from the
   2002-2015 period. Performance of the warning system was evaluated with
   various contingency criteria (e.g., probability of detection and success
   rate). Furthermore, specific flood events were analysed in more details,
   by comparing warnings issued for exceeding different critical flood
   quantiles and their associated timing with field observations. The
   performance results show that the proposed FF warning system is useful,
   especially for ungauged sites. The analysis also points out the need to
   account for the uncertainties in the precipitation inputs and the
   hydrological modelling, as well as include precipitation forecasts to
   improve the effective warning lead time.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods monitoring systems developed up to now generally enable a
   real-time assessment of the potential flash-floods magnitudes based on
   highly distributed hydrological models and weather radar records. The
   approach presented here aims to go one step ahead by offering a direct
   assessment of the potential impacts of flash floods on inhabited areas.
   This approach is based on an a priori analysis of the considered area in
   order (1) to evaluate based on a semi-automatic hydraulic approach
   (Cartino method) the potentially flooded areas for different discharge
   levels, and (2) to identify the associated buildings and/or population
   at risk based on geographic databases. This preliminary analysis enables
   to build a simplified impact model (discharge-impact curve) for each
   river reach, which can be used to directly estimate the importance of
   potentially affected assets based on the outputs of a distributed
   rainfall-runoff model. This article presents a first case study
   conducted in the Gard region (south eastern France). The first
   validation results are presented in terms of (1) accuracy of the
   delineation of the flooded areas estimated based on the Cartino method
   and using a high resolution DTM, and (2) relevance and usefulness of the
   impact model obtained. The impacts estimated at the event scale will now
   be evaluated in a near future based on insurance claim data provided by
   CCR (Caisse Centrale de Reassurrance).}},

Abstract = {{For a long time, flood risk management in France was oriented around
   controlling the hazard with the installation of structural measures such
   as dikes. Since the 1990s, however, numerous events have shown that
   these measures are not always effective. As a result, institutions now
   consider that other actions, such as preventive measures, are possible.
   Risk management is based on public policies and involves a number of
   players, as well as the societies exposed to the risks. The goal of our
   study is to show the various orientations of risk management by looking
   at several examples from Mediterranean France, where flash floods are
   common, in particular using post event analysis. Post-event observations
   let us evaluate the effectiveness of flood-management methods. Do public
   policies work, and do they have a real influence on reducing deaths and
   damage? Are individual measures overtaking collective ones? The main
   results of our study show that the event itself is more important in
   determining which measures are applied than public policies, which do
   not take into account local specificities.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods that occurred in the urban part of Attica, Greece, in the
   last decades, have caused, overall, serious property and infrastructure
   damages, economic and social activities impediment and, occasionally,

   rainfall hazard and the induced impact, as measured by impact
   indicators, and examines the effect of the social factor on the
   vulnerability of the system exposed to the flash flood risk. The study
   focuses on the catastrophic flash flood event that affected Attica on
   October 22, 2015. The methodology includes the analysis of the
   spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and citizens' calls to the Fire
   Service emergency for help during the event, as well as the analysis of
   people's responses at an on-line behavioral survey. Results feature the
   roles of the rainfall hazard and of the society on the flash flood

   events occurred in the southern part of Germany, which triggered some
   severe flash floods with significant building damage in the affected
   municipalities.
   The devastating flash flood of May 29, 2016 in Braunsbach in the
   district Schwabisch Hall in Baden-Wurttemberg caused heavy structural
   damage to some of the approximately 130 affected buildings.
   The paper gives an overview of the building damages documented
   immediately after the event. The damages cases were classified and
   assessed using the evaluation system of the EDAC-flood damage model
   developed at the Earthquake Damage Analysis Center (EDAC) of the
   Bauhaus-Universitat Weimar. The analysis illustrates the particularities
   of the damage patterns due to flash floods compared to conventional

Abstract = {{Urban flooding has been a severe problem for many cities around the
   world as it remains one of the greatest threats to the property and
   safety of human communities. In Australia, it is seen as the most
   expensive natural hazard. However, urban areas that are impervious to
   rainwater have been sharply increasing owing to booming construction
   activities and rapid urbanisation. The change in the built environment
   may cause more frequent and longer duration of flooding in floodprone
   urban regions. Thus, the flood inundation issue associated with the
   effects of land uses needs to be explored and developed. This research
   constructs a framework for modelling urban flood inundation. Different
   rainfall events are then designed for examining the impact on flash
   floods generated by land-use changes. Measurement is formulated for
   changes of topographical features over a real time series. Geographic
   Information System (GIS) technologies are then utilised to visualise the
   effects of land-use changes on flood inundation under different types of
   storms. Based on a community-based case study, the results reveal that
   the built environment leads to varying degrees of aggravation of urban
   flash floods with different storm events and a few rainwater storage
   units may slightly mitigate flooding extents under different storm
   conditions. Hence, it is recommended that the outcomes of this study
   could be applied to flood assessment measures for urban development and
   the attained results could be utilised in government planning to raise
   awareness of flood hazard.}},

Abstract = {{The present study focuses on the impact generated by flash floods within
   the mountain area of the Mures hydrographic basin, namely by analyzing
   the data offered by the hydrographical station of Stanceni regarding
   measurements of the hazards and the economical and environmental
   aspects. Thus, the study is directed towards the representative
   flash-floods that occurred during the years of 1970, 1975, 1995, 1998,
   and 2005.
   The comparative analysis of the hazard involves hydrograph reference
   regarding the largest floods to be recorded in the years of 1970, 1975,
   1995, 1998, and 2005 in the upper river basin of Mures, including the
   flow rates, the volumes transported, the growth and decay duration as
   well as reports to the total duration of the floods in the study.
   The vulnerability of the area is influenced by the population density,
   which is lower as compared to the plain area crossed by the river Mures
   mainly in it's middle and lower sector, and the area's economical
   development.
   The effects of the major flash floods are reflected within the amount of
   damage caused in the studied area.
   The paper finally states the structural and non-structural measures that
   have been taken in order to reduce the impact that flash-floods have
   upon the upper side of the Mures river basin, within the county of
   Mures.}},

Abstract = {{Most road-stream crossings over ephemeral channels are vulnerable to
   extreme hydrologic events. Ford stream crossings (FSCs) are usually
   dangerous for the road traffic during periods of high flow, in
   particular under flash flood conditions. The present paper analyzes the
   flood hazards on the Mediterranean coast in the Region of Murcia
   (south-east Spain), affecting this type of road-stream crossing over dry
   channels, according to hydraulic variables and bedload transport rates
   estimated for discharges at bankfull and flood-prone stages. Under such
   conditions, the safety of people and vehicles was obtained using
   numerical models, developed by previous researchers; in particular,
   water levels and flow velocities across ford reaches were compared with
   different trend curves between water depths and corresponding critical
   velocities for children and adults, and for various prototype vehicles.
   Specifically, two approaches to assess this type of hazards were
   proposed: a specific Hydraulic Hazard Index and an algorithm for
   estimating the flood hazard from criteria of bed stability and bedload
   transport capacity (Flood Hazard at Fords, FHF). In addition, different
   exposure levels were established, using a Flood Vulnerability Index,
   based on the FHF, the road category, and the annual average daily
   traffic. The FHF model gave the best results with regard to the
   magnitude of the damage observed in recent flash floods for flow stages
   similar to those simulated. According to the danger thresholds
   established for this index, half-bankfull flows represent here a high
   risk: 27.3\% of FSCs for mini-cars and 18.2\% for large cars. At
   bankfull, the FHF exhibits very high values for mini-cars (77.3\% of
   FSCs) and for large passenger vehicles (50\% of FSCs), while at the
   floodprone stage, extreme FHF values are reached for all kinds of
   vehicles at most of the ford crossings.}},

Abstract = {{Many historical arch bridges are situated in Mountain regions. Such
   historical bridges may be exposed to several natural hazards such as
   flash floods with dead wood and debris flows. For example, in the year
   2000 a heavy debris flow destroyed an arch bridge in Log Pod Mangartom,
   Slovenia and only recently, in September 2008 an arch bridge was
   overflowed by a debris flow. A new launched research project at the
   University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna tries
   to combine advanced numerical models of debris flows with advanced
   models of historical masonry arch bridges under horizontal loads. The
   research project starts with separate finite element modelling of
   different structural elements of arch bridges such as spandrel walls,
   the arch itself, roadway slabs, pavements and foundations under single
   and distributed horizontal loads. Furthermore miniaturized tests are
   planned to investigate the behaviour of the overall bridge under debris
   flow impacts. The results will be used to combine the modelling of the
   different structural elements considering the interaction during a
   horizontal loading. Furthermore this bridge model will then be combined
   with debris flow simulation. Also earlier works considering horizontal
   ship impacts against historical arch bridges will be used control. The
   paper will present latest research results.}},

Abstract = {{There is observational evidence that hydrometeorological extremes, such
   as heavy rainfall events, have become more frequent and intense in the
   last decades around the world. In Brazil, intense rainfall events that
   triggered flash floods and landslides were responsible for 74\% of the
   deaths related to natural disasters in the 1991-2010 period. To evaluate
   Brazil's hot spots of vulnerability to these disasters, two indices were
   developed using three data sets: (1) climate, with IPCC climate extreme
   indices; (2) environmental, including land use, drainage systems,
   relief, slope, road density and hydrography; and (3) socioeconomic,
   including the Gini coefficient, Human Development Index, housing
   conditions and a poverty-related index. Simulations at high resolution
   were carried out using the Eta 20-km regional climate model nested
   within two global climate models: HadGEM2 ES and MIROC 5 IPCC AR5
   models. For the baseline period of 1961-1990, the vulnerability indices
   were adjusted by means of an iterative process and were validated by
   comparing them to the Brazilian National Disasters Data. The two indices
   were also used to estimate the vulnerability up to the end of the
   twenty-first century, using the representative concentration pathways
   (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 from the IPCC AR5 RCP scenarios. The results indicate
   a large increase in Brazil's vulnerability to landslides and flash
   floods in the context of climate change.}},

Title = {{Beyond `flood hotspots': Modelling emergency service accessibility
   during flooding in York, UK}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a method that couples flood
   modelling with network analysis to evaluate the accessibility of city
   districts by emergency responders during flood events. We integrate
   numerical modelling of flood inundation with geographical analysis of
   service areas for the Ambulance Service and the Fire \& Rescue Service.
   The method was demonstrated for two flood events in the City of York, UK
   to assess the vulnerability of care homes and sheltered accommodation.
   We determine the feasibility of emergency services gaining access within
   the statutory 8- and 10-min targets for high priority, life-threatening
   incidents 75\% of the time, during flood episodes. A hydrodynamic flood
   inundation model (FloodMap) simulates the 2014 pluvial and 2015 fluvial
   flood events. Predicted floods (with depth >25 cm and areas >100m(2))
   were overlain on the road network to identify sites with potentially
   restricted access. Accessibility of the city to emergency responders
   during flooding was quantified and mapped using; (i) spatial coverage
   from individual emergency nodes within the legislated timeframes, and;
   (ii) response times from individual emergency service nodes to
   vulnerable care homes and sheltered accommodation under flood and
   non-flood conditions. Results show that, during the 2015 fluvial flood,
   the area covered by two of the three Fire \& Rescue Service stations
   reduced by 14\% and 39\% respectively, while the remaining station
   needed to increase its coverage by 39\%. This amounts to an overall
   reduction of 6\% and 20\% for modelled and observed floods respectively.
   During the 2014 surface water flood, 7 out of 22 care homes (32\%) and
   15 out of 43 sheltered accommodation nodes (35\%) had modelled response
   times above the 8-min threshold from any Ambulance station. Overall,
   modelled surface water flooding has a larger spatial footprint than
   fluvial flood events. Hence, accessibility of emergency services may be
   impacted differently depending on flood mechanism. Moreover, we expect
   emergency services to face greater challenges under a changing climate
   with a growing, more vulnerable population. The methodology developed in
   this study could be applied to other cities, as well as for
   scenario-based evaluation of emergency preparedness to support strategic
   decision making, and in real-time forecasting to guide operational
   decisions where heavy rainfall lead-time and spatial resolution are
   sufficient. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   Households' Socioeconomic Asset Profile? Evidence from Tropical

Abstract = {{This article documents the results of an empirical investigation on the
   complex interplay between diverse coping mechanisms and the
   socioeconomic asset profiles of coastal households at risk. Focusing on
   household-level perceptions and responses to cyclone hazards, a case
   study was carried out in a poor area in Bangladesh that is prone to
   natural hazards. We developed and tested our own analytical models based
   on the asset approach. We conducted a face-to-face household survey in
   southwestern coastal Bangladesh, in the Koyra sub-district, in late
   2009. We asked 360 households affected by the May 2009 tropical Cyclone
   Aila about their hazard perceptions, preparedness, coping practices, and
   socioeconomic assets. The results suggest that the majority of
   households at risk perceive an increasing trend of different climate
   hazards, with a distinct dominance of tropical cyclones, storm surges,
   and flash floods in the study area, which resulted in a yearly average
   economic damage of USD 144 for each household in the first year after
   Aila. However, such damage is significantly and inversely correlated
   with the number of adopted coping practices. Significant and systematic
   differences exist between upstream and downstream households in the
   study area with respect to hazard perception, hazard induced damages,
   asset accessibility, and adopted diversified coping practices. The
   empirical findings suggest that the degree of adoption of coping
   practices depends primarily on elements of socioeconomic asset profile
   and the duration of the consequences of cyclone hazards. Disaster
   preparedness training seems to improve at-risk households' degree of
   information access and eventually leads them to adopt more coping
   practices to reduce adverse impacts of climate hazards. Area-specific
   practical modules on coping practices should be incorporated in
   curricula of disaster preparedness training to make people at risk more
   resilient to hazard shocks.}},

Abstract = {{SMART was the light in the tunnel to end devastating floods at Kuala
   Lumpur City Centre. SMART refers to ``Storm-water Management and Road
   Tunnel.{''} Completed in the year 2007, this iconic structure is the
   longest multipurpose water storm tunnel in the world. The 3 kilometers
   motor way is part of the 9.7 kilometers water tunnel constructed to
   reduce risk of food by diverting water during flash flood and to
   alleviate the heavy traffic during peak hours at Jalan Loke Yew, Pudu
   flyover and Sungai Besi areas. It is a unique and innovative disaster
   management structure and created with a designed maintenance system to
   support its purposes. This research work has been carried out to
   investigate the effects of SMART tunnel maintenance works on flooding
   and traffic flow. Data have been drawn from records and simple
   statistical method were used to analyze them. Ten respondents were
   interviewed to verify and validate the results. The study found that
   SMART Tunnel maintenance works has positive significant effects on flood
   occurrences and has no significant association with traffic flow. This
   research offers the reason of improving maintenance works of SMART
   Tunnel to enable its optimum utilization its purposes of flood
   occurrences and traffic flow at Kuala Lumpur City Centre.}},

Abstract = {{Cognition of risk is the first step in reducing disaster damage and
   losses. In this study, risk cognition in the Hani Rice Terraces, the
   core tourism attraction in Yuanyang County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan,
   China, is analyzed based on field survey and participatory geographic
   information system (GIS). The results show that tourism communities have
   cognition of risk; are more sensitive to hazards (especially drought);
   have more severe potential damage and losses from hazards; and also have
   more enthusiasm to adapt to disaster risk, when compared with a
   non-tourism community. On disaster vulnerability maps, the tourism
   communities identified the unique ``Forest - Village - Terrace -
   River{''} landscape while the non-tourism community only recognized the
   terrace and the village as the main elements affected by hazard. Also,
   the tourism communities had deeper understandings of drought, flash
   floods and landslide disaster risks. A conceptual model based on
   ``Pressure - State - Response{''} relationships is put forward to
   explore the situation in which, in the tourism community, terraces have
   a greater variety of functions and enhanced values resulting in the
   spatial expansion of hazard effects.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To propose a simple and effective tool for decision-making
   regarding general evacuation during a rapid river flood.
   Study design: Virtual testing of a tool in a real event.
   Method: A four-component tool was applied to build an alternative
   scenario of the catastrophic river flood in Obrenovac, Serbia, on May
   2014. The components of this tool are: (1) the amount of precipitation
   above the 95th percentile of all previous measurements; (2) upstream
   river discharge above the 95th percentile of all previous measurements;
   (3) upstream river level above the 95th percentile of all previous
   measurements; and (4) worsening of the hydrometeorological situation in
   the following 48 h.
   Results: In the early morning of 16 May 2014, a rapid river wave flooded
   80\% of the Obrenovac territory. There were 13 deaths due to drowning.
   Application of the study tool shows that these lives could have been
   saved, as the score to recommend general evacuation was reached 1 day
   before the flooding. The application of this tool to two previous great
   floods in Serbia shows that the score to recommend general evacuation
   was reached either 1 day before or on the onset of flash flooding.
   Conclusions: Due to its simplicity, this tool is universally applicable
   to facilitate decisionmaking regarding general evacuation during a rapid
   river flood, and it should be further tested in future similar
   catastrophes. (C) 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by

Abstract = {{Extreme weather events are common and increasing in intensity in the
   southwestern Pacific region. Health impacts from cyclones and tropical
   storms cause acute injuries and infectious disease outbreaks. Defining
   population vulnerability to extreme weather events by examining a recent
   flood in Honiara, Solomon Islands, can help stakeholders and
   policymakers adapt development to reduce future threats. The acute and
   subacute health impacts following the April 2014 floods were defined
   using data obtained from hospitals and clinics, the Ministry of Health
   and in-country World Health Organization office in Honiara. Geographical
   information system (GIS) was used to assess morbidity and mortality, and
   vulnerability of the health system infrastructure and households in
   Honiara. The April flash floods were responsible for 21 acute deaths, 33
   injuries, and a diarrhea outbreak that affected 8,584 people with 10
   pediatric deaths. A GIS vulnerability assessment of the location of the
   health system infrastructure and households relative to rivers and the
   coastline identified 75\% of the health infrastructure and over 29\% of
   Honiara's population as vulnerable to future hydrological events.
   Honiara, Solomon Islands, is a rapidly growing, highly vulnerable urban
   Pacific Island environment. Evaluation of the mortality and morbidity
   from the April 2014 floods as well as the infectious disease outbreaks
   that followed allows public health specialists and policy makers to
   understand the health system and populations vulnerability to future
   shocks. Understanding the negative impacts natural disaster have on
   people living in urban Pacific environments will help the government as
   well as development partners in crafting resilient adaptation
   development.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a hindcast analysis was performed of the 2015 Memorial Day
   flood for Brays Bayou in Harris County, Texas. Point rainfall totals as
   high as 27.84cm (10.96in.) occurred in this watershed in a 12-h period,
   causing severe flood damage to 1,185 residential properties. By
   validating hydrologic and hydraulic models representative of watershed
   conditions at the time of the storm, this study provides a comprehensive
   spatial perspective and understanding of the flows and stages,
   floodplain extents and depths, and residential damages that occurred. In
   addition, Project Brays, one of the largest urban watershed-scale flood
   reduction projects in the nation, was nearly halfway complete at the
   time of the 2015 Memorial Day storm. Subsequently, this study evaluates
   and compares the flood response to this rainfall event for different
   watershed conditions representing preproject conditions (2001), May 2015
   conditions (current), and postproject conditions (2021 at the earliest).
   The flood reductions that were provided by Project Brays at the time of
   the storm and the flood impacts that would have occurred even if the
   project had been finalized prior to the storm are assessed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{For the first time flood mortality is analysed and compared between a
   Western (Portugal) and an Eastern Mediterranean country (Greece). Flood
   fatalities are examined and compared in terms of frequency, temporal
   evolution, spatial distribution, deadliest flood types, gender of the
   victims, circumstances surrounding fatalities, and individual and
   societal risk.
   A common flood fatalities database was formed for the period 1960-2010
   by merging the DISASTER database for Portugal and the Greek database
   Individual flood cases generated more deaths in Greece than in Portugal
   (excluding an outlier flash flood event in the latter). Despite some
   fluctuations evidence of a gradual decrease in fatality numbers were
   recorded for both countries. Since the 1980's the number of flood cases
   with multiple fatalities has been gradually declining, due to changes in
   qualitative characteristics of mortality. Flood fatalities predominantly
   occur during autumn in Greece and during winter in Portugal.
   In both Greece and Portugal flash floods were responsible for more than
   80\% of the total mortality. The main metropolitan areas of each country
   were found to be hotspots of flood mortality; a trend connected, with
   the higher population density along the coastal areas combined with the
   expansion of urban fabric towards flood-prone areas.
   Gender distribution of fatalities indicates that males are more
   vulnerable in both countries. The circumstances surrounding fatalities
   showed that fatalities occurring inside buildings have been gradually
   reducing in time, while vehicle-related deaths have been rising, showing
   that individuals hold an active role when they voluntarily enter in
   floodwaters during a flood.}},

Abstract = {{A severe flash flood event hit the town of Braunsbach
   (Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) on the evening of May 29, 2016, heavily
   damaging and destroying several dozens of buildings. It was only one of
   several disastrous events in Central Europe caused by the low-pressure
   system ``Elvira{''}. The DFG Graduate School ``Natural hazards and risks
   in a changing world{''} (NatRiskChange, GRK 2043/1) at the University of
   Potsdam investigated the Braunsbach flash flood as a recent showcase for
   catastrophic events triggered by severe weather. This contribution is
   part two of a back-to-back publication on the results of this storm
   event. While part 1 analyses the meteorological and hydrological
   situation, part 2 concentrates on the geomorphological aspects and
   damage to buildings. The study outlines the origin and amount of
   material that was mobilized and transported into the town by the flood,
   and analyses damage data collected for 96 affected buildings, describing
   the degree of impact, underlying processes, and building
   characteristics. Due to the potentially high sediment load of flash
   floods and their non-steady and non-uniform flow especially in built-up
   areas, the damaging processes differ from those of clear water floods.
   The results underline the need to consider flash floods and their
   specific behaviour in flood hazard assessments.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Despite there being well-established meteorological and hydrometric
   monitoring networks in the UK, many smaller catchments remain ungauged.
   This leaves a challenge for characterisation, modelling, forecasting and
   management activities. Here we demonstrate the value of community-based
   ('citizen science') observations for modelling and understanding
   catchment response as a contribution to catchment science. The scheme
   implemented within the 42 km(2) Haltwhistle Burn catchment, a tributary
   of the River Tyne in northeast England, has harvested and used
   quantitative and qualitative observations from the public in a novel way
   to effectively capture spatial and temporal river response.
   Community-based rainfall, river level and flood observations have been
   successfully collected and quality-checked, and used to build and run a
   physically-based, spatially-distributed catchment model, SHETRAN. Model
   performance using different combinations of observations is tested
   against traditionally-derived hydro graphs. Our results show how the
   local network of community-based observations alongside traditional
   sources of hydro-information supports characterisation of catchment
   response more accurately than using traditional observations alone over
   both spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate that these
   community-derived datasets are most valuable during local flash flood
   events, particularly towards peak discharge. This information is often
   missed or poorly represented by ground-based gauges, or significantly
   underestimated by rainfall radar, as this study clearly demonstrates.
   While community-based observations are less valuable during prolonged
   and widespread floods, or over longer hydrological periods of interest,
   they can still ground-truth existing traditional sources of catchment
   data to increase confidence during characterisation and management
   activities. Involvement of the public in data collection activities also
   encourages wider community engagement, and provides important
   information for catchment management. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{A place for smartphone technologies and Digital Social Networks (RSN) in
   institutional flood warning systems in France?}},
Journal = {{CYBERGEO-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Information given on flash floods in real time should undoubtedly
   correspond to the citizens needs as well as to the politics and the
   safety guidelines. To supply this objective, Numerical Social Networks
   (NSN) and smartphone applications could positively complete the official
   institutional system, especially by means of the dynamic nature of
   shared contents, and with the social interactions they support.
   Nonetheless, even if several countries (United States or Philippines for
   example) already use these systems to warn the population in case of
   future floods, and even if the French government launched a specific app
   the 2016 June 8th (namely SAIP), the French citizens and stakeholders do
   not always use them during the alert process. This is generally
   explained by the French protection system on individual data, the lack
   of validation over information shared by citizens in real time and by
   the technical locks the official services have to remove. Then this
   paper aims to address the benefits and limits from the use of NSN and
   smartphones during flood warnings in France, and it also seeks to
   identify the place of such systems to perform their utility in short
   term.}},

Abstract = {{Dealing with flood hazard and risk requires approaches rooted in both
   natural and social sciences, which provided the nexus for the ongoing
   debate on sociohydrology. Various combinations of non-structural and
   structural flood risk reduction options are available to communities.
   Focusing on flood risk and the information associated with it,
   developing risk management plans is required but often overlooks public
   perception of a threat. The perception of risk varies in many different
   ways, especially between the authorities and the affected public. It is
   because of this disconnection that many risk management plans concerning
   floods have failed in the past. This paper examines the private
   adaptation capacity and willingness with respect to flooding in two
   different catchments in Greece prone to multiple flood events during the
   last 20 years. Two studies (East Attica and Evros) were carried out,
   comprised of a survey questionnaire of 155 and 157 individuals, from a
   periurban (East Attica) and a rural (Evros) area, respectively, and they
   focused on those vulnerable to periodic (rural area) and flash floods
   (peri-urban area). Based on the comparisons drawn from these responses,
   and identifying key issues to be addressed when flood risk management
   plans are implemented, improvements are being recommended for the social
   dimension surrounding such implementation. As such, the paper
   contributes to the ongoing discussion on human-environment interaction
   in socio-hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{Urban Flood is one of the biggest environmental problems of the planet.
   It generates high negative impacts of various kinds: social,
   environmental and economic. These problems grow exponentially in
   megacities, since the disorderly occupation of land, coupled with the
   size of the population, make it extremely complex to control and to
   manage. Structural measures for flood control are not enough; the city
   needs to deploy a number of non-structural measures such as a flood
   warning system. This system aims to provide real-time occurrence and
   forecast of floods that may cause impacts in several areas of the city.
   These forecasts trigger a series of actions for civil defense,
   firefighter, traffic control, social support and other entities. The
   flood warning system of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region, Brazil,
   called SAISP system, installed a set of weather radars and telemetry
   networks, as well as a decision support system (SSD) operated by
   engineers and meteorologists, which generates a set of forecasting
   bulletins 24 hours a day during all year long. Several public
   organizations and press receive these bulletins in real time and a set
   of actions can be managed in order to minimize the impacts of critical
   hydrological events. This paper presents some analysis of a flash flood
   event observed in the Jaguar River small catchment on February 6th, 2016
   (80 mm in one hour). In this day a set of social works could be done due
   to SAISP information. Therefore with this event was possible to evaluate
   a set of social benefits that this type of system back to town. In
   general is very difficult to assess the social benefits that this type
   of system produces in a big city, so the information obtained in this
   event can subsidize the planning of new systems, as overall social
   benefits are difficult to measure in economic values, because most of
   them are intangible.}},

Abstract = {{This article shows the design and development of a reactive early
   warning model as part of a reactive early warning system for urban flash
   flood management in the city of Barranquilla, Colombia. The system is
   divided into four components: (i) measuring equipment with rainfall and
   flow rate gauges, datalogging and transmission, (ii) a system for
   database processing and a web interface, (iii) a numerical
   rainfall-runoff model in PCSWMM calibrated and validated, and (iv) a
   reactive early warning model for determining the hazard level, and for
   making decisions of alertness along the main streets. Twelve (12)
   rainfall gauges were installed in the city, covering around 150 Km(2).
   The numerical model in PCSWMM was calibrated and validated with rainfall
   and flow rate data measured in a typical subcatchment of the city. A
   time of concentration equation was developed from the characteristics of
   the subcatchment such as slope and length. A pilot urban watershed was
   selected to test the system, from which hazard alerts every minute with
   forecasting of up to 40 minutes ahead on the lower parts of the
   watershed were determined. That time may allow people to make prompt
   decisions regarding their mobility over the city and reducing accidents
   caused by flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed many drowning tragedies on roads, even where
   flood gauges were equipped to warn drivers about the depth of the flood
   water. The effectiveness of traditional flood gauges using the digit
   representation has been questioned. According to the
   attention-knowledge-compliance three-stage model, we propose that color
   coding can improve the effect of flood gauges. The present study
   compared the performance of a prototypical color flood gauge with two
   types of digit flood gauges in four experiments. Our results revealed a
   general advantage of color flood gauges over digit flood gauges in all
   testing conditions (with or without reflection and dynamic or static
   observation), which was manifested in both a sample of people lacking
   driving experience and a sample of experienced drivers. Specifically,
   the mean accuracy of color gauge conditions in the four experiments
   increased by at least 16\%, and the mean response time to the color
   gauge was shortened by at least 0.8 s compared with the digit gauge. The
   substantial benefit of color gauges over digit gauges suggests that
   color coding can be used to improve the effectiveness of flood gauges on
   flood-prone roads. Because of its low cost, the color coding flood gauge
   may be useful in the developing world to warn against extreme rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past several decades, flash floods that occurred in Attica,
   Greece, caused serious property and infrastructure damages, disruptions
   in economic and social activities, and human fatalities. This paper
   investigated the link between rainfall and flash flood impact during the
   catastrophic event that affected Attica on 22 October 2015, while also
   addressing human risk perception and behavior as a response to flash
   floods. The methodology included the analysis of the space-time
   correlation of rainfall with the citizens' calls to the emergency fire
   services for help, and the statistical analysis of people's responses to
   an online behavioral survey. The results designated critical rainfall
   thresholds associated with flash flood impact in the four most affected
   subareas of the Attica region. The impact magnitude was found to be
   associated with the localized accumulated rainfall. Vulnerability
   factors, namely, population density, geographical, and environmental
   features, may have contributed to the differences in the impact
   magnitudes between the examined subareas. The analysis of the survey's
   behavioral responses provided insights into peoples' risk perception and
   coping responses relative to the space-time distribution of rainfall.
   The findings of this study were in agreement with the hypothesis that
   the more severe the rainfall, the higher peoples' severity assessment
   and the intensity of emotional response. Deeper feelings of fear and
   worry were found to be related to more adjustments to the scheduled
   activities and travels. Additionally, being alert to the upcoming
   rainfall risk was found to be related to decreased worry and fear and to
   fewer changes in scheduled activities.}},

Abstract = {{The management of stormwater runoff via distributed green
   infrastructures delivers a number of environmental services that go
   beyond the reduction of flood risk, which has been the focus of
   conventional stormwater systems. Not all of these services may be
   equally valued by the public, however. This paper estimates households'
   willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements in water security, stream
   health, recreational and amenity values, as well as reduction in flood
   risk and urban heat island effect. We use data from nearly 1000 personal
   interviews with residential homeowners in Melbourne and Sydney,
   Australia. Our results suggest that the WTP for the highest levels of
   all environmental services is A\$799 per household per year. WTP is
   mainly driven by residents valuing improvements in local stream health,
   exemptions in water restrictions, the prevention of flash flooding, and
   decreased peak urban temperatures respectively at A\$297, A\$244, A\$104
   and A\$65 per year. We further conduct a benefit transfer analysis and
   find that the WTP and compensating surplus are not significantly
   different between the study areas. Our findings provide additional
   support that stormwater management via green infrastructures have large
   nonmarket benefits and that, under certain conditions, benefit values
   can be transferred to different locations.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing awareness that fast response to emergency situation
   requires effective coordination among several institutional and
   non-institutional actors. The most common approaches, based on
   innovating technologies for information collection and management, are
   not sufficient to cope with the increasing complexity of emergency
   management. This work demonstrates that effective cooperation claims for
   a shift from information management to interaction management.
   Therefore, methods and tools are required in order to better understand
   the complexity of the interactions taking place during an emergency, and
   to analyse the actual roles and responsibilities of the different
   actors. This paper details the design and implementation of an
   integrated approach aiming to unravel the complexity of the interaction
   network based on Storytelling, the Problem Structuring Method, and
   Social Network Analysis. The potential of the integrated approach has
   been investigated in the Lorca (Spain) flood risk management case study.

Abstract = {{This study aims at enabling the compilation of key lessons for decision
   makers and urban planners in rapidly urbanizing cities regarding the
   identification of representative, chief causal natural and human factors
   for the increased level of flash flood risk. To achieve this, the
   impacts of flash flood events of 2013 and 2014 in the capital of Sudan,
   Khartoum, were assessed using seven integrated approaches, i.e. rainfall
   data analysis, document analysis of affected people and houses,
   observational fieldwork in the worst flood affected areas, people's
   perception of causes and mitigation measures through household
   interviews, reported drinking water quality, reported water-related
   diseases and social risk assessment. Several lessons have been developed
   as follows. Urban planners must recognize the devastating risks of
   building within natural pathways of ephemeral watercourses. They must
   also ensure effective drainage infrastructures and physio-geographical
   investigations prior to developing urban areas. The existing urban
   drainage systems become ineffective due to blockage by urban waste.
   Building of unauthorized drainage and embankment structures by locals
   often cause greater flood problems than normal. The urban runoff is
   especially problematic for residential areas built within low-lying
   areas having naturally low infiltration capacity, as surface water can
   rapidly collect within hollows and depressions, or beside elevated roads
   that preclude the free flow of floodwater. Weak housing and
   infrastructure quality are especially vulnerable to flash flooding and
   even to rainfall directly. Establishment of services infrastructure is
   imperative for flash flood disaster risk reduction. Water supply should
   be from lower aquifers to avoid contaminant ground water. Regular
   monitoring of water quality and archiving of its indicators help
   identify water-related diseases and sources of water contamination in
   the event of environmental disasters such as floods. Though the
   understanding of risk perception by the locals is an important aspect of
   the decision making and planning processes, it should be advanced enough
   for proper awareness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Forest ownership is considered as a vital aspect for sustainable
   management of forest and its associated biodiversity. The Global Forest
   Resources Assessment 2015 reported that privately owned forest area are
   increasing on a global scale, but deforestation was found very active in
   privately owned hill forest areas of Malaysia. Penang State was
   purposively chosen as it has been experiencing rapid and radical changes
   due to urban expansion over the last three decades. In this study,
   analyses of land-use changes were done by PCI Geomatica using Landsat
   images from 1991 to 2015, future trends of land-use change were assessed
   using EXCEL forecast function, and its impact on the surrounding
   environment were conducted by reviewing already published articles on
   changing environment of the study area. This study revealed an annual
   deforestation rate of 1.4\% in Penang Island since 1991. Trend analysis
   forecasted a forest area smaller than the current forest reserves by the
   year 2039. Impact analysis revealed a rapid biodiversity loss with
   increasing landslides, mudflows, water pollution, flash flood, and
   health hazard. An immediate ban over hill-land development is crucial
   for overall environmental safety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Flash floods leading to complete submergence of rice plants for 10-15
   days is one of the major constraints for rice production, mainly in
   rainfed lowland areas. In India, 30\% of the rice growing area (12-14 M
   ha) is prone to flash flooding with average productivity of only 0.5-0.8
   t ha(-1). Coastal Odisha is one of the most flood prone areas of India
   where the paddy crop in the wet season is often devastated by flash
   floods, forcing farmers either to discontinue paddy cultivation or to
   revert to traditional varieties with very low yields. The flood tolerant
   variety, Swarna-Sub1 (SS1), was introduced through cluster
   demonstrations in some villages of the Bari block of Odisha in 2013. SS1
   seeds were provided to 355 farmers in two villages affected by floods
   twice in 2013. The majority of the farmers cultivated SS1 in 2013 and
   about 75\% of them persisted with the variety in 2014. There has been a
   steady and significant increase in paddy cultivation and yields per unit
   area between 2012 and 2014 and a sharp increase in paddy sales during
   2013 and 2014. The present study showed that farmers preferred to
   cultivate low yielding traditional land races owing to their better
   flood tolerance and the unavailability of flood tolerant high yielding
   varieties (HYVs). Traditional varieties gave 30-42\% higher yields than
   non-SS1 HYVs when flooding occurred. SS1 on the other hand offered a
   significant yield advantage of about twice that of traditional
   varieties, in both flooding and non-flooding years. There is an
   additional social advantage of SSI in that famers belonging to scheduled
   castes in flood prone villages, have greater numbers of plots that are
   exposed to prolonged floods. Thus they benefit proportionately more from
   the introduction of SS1.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood often causes serious losses in small catchments of China.
   Nevertheless, the flash flood vulnerability assessment is relatively
   limited in China. This paper presented a material flow assessment
   framework to evaluate the flash flood vulnerability for small catchments
   in Wuzhishan County of Hainan province, China. The framework was
   developed into three parts: selection of typical villages and small
   catchments, calculation of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity
   with material flow analysis, and multiple evaluation of vulnerability
   with the proposed material flow indices. In this framework, all material
   flows of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity were measured by
   water's mass. Then, the relationship between the three elements of
   vulnerability was established through material flow indices. Results of
   the three elements of vulnerability and four material flow indices in
   each small catchment were exhibited via GIS. The evaluation results
   suggested that catchments with lower exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
   capacity did not necessarily lead to lower vulnerability, as the
   inherent relationship among them might aggravate the vulnerability of
   catchments to flash flood. Some suggestions were put forward for the
   prevention of flash flood based on the vulnerability assessment.
   Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the approach were
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Gdansk is an important Polish city and harbour situated on the southern
   coast of the Baltic Sea in the Gulf of Gdansk, in the lowland delta at
   the mouth of the Vistula River. At present Gdansk has 460 thousand
   inhabitants and covers an area of 262 km(2). The population and the area
   of the city have not changed over recent decades. In previous centuries
   the city was affected by severe floods, which caused considerable
   economic damage and the death of inhabitants. Most of these floods were
   caused by ice jams. The complicated system of rivers and channels within
   the city and in its close surroundings is called the Gdansk Water Node
   (GWN). The possible directions of flood hazard are: from the sea (Martwa
   Vistula), and from the main Vistula channel in the case of a breached
   left embankment. Flood hazard from the catchment of the RCh was not
   considered by city authorities.
   In July 2001, a devastating flash flood unexpectedly hit the city of
   Gdansk. The paper presents this flood as a case study, without reference
   to other floods of similar character. It describes the city of Gdansk,
   which is an important economic, cultural, scientific, political and
   industrial center, the system of rivers and channels within Gdansk which
   form Gdansk Water Node (GWN), the precipitation regime, the course of
   the flood, and its effects. A special project was formulated after the
   flood with the aim of developing the proposal of new hydraulic
   engineering solutions in the GWN and in the catchment of Radunia Channel
   to prevent similar floods in the city in cases of rainfall similar to
   that of 2001. The paper also presents the implementation of the proposed
   engineering solutions.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to examine the association between double-loop
   disaster learning and transformations of political systems. The
   particular question is how disasters increase the rapidity and
   complexity, with which the transforming regimes face the unsuitability
   and inadequacy of the past forms and processes of disaster governance.
   The centennial evolution of the disaster relief law at a country scale
   (Czech Republic, resp. Czechoslovakia, 1918-present) is used as an
   example. The thorough search in digital repository of Czech and Slovak
   Parliamentary Library was performed to obtain legislative norms and
   protocols from parliamentary debates, whereas major disasters that
   induced new laws (1927 flash flood, 1947 drought, 1997 and 2002 floods)
   were identified from existing databases and from detailed
   reconstructions of historical disastrous events. The described cases
   enabled to add new empirical evidence contesting (i) the process scheme
   of disaster politics during critical junctures and institutional
   transformations, and (ii) the progressive nature of the double-loop
   learning approach related to disasters. It is shown that the double-loop
   learning from disasters and its benefits should be considered as
   time-dependent and related to permissive and productive conditions that
   facilitated the adoption of the new disaster relief law(i.e. the
   learning process). Finally, the implications for the research agenda
   (historical disaster research) and for disaster policy (evaluation of
   disaster relief effectiveness) are summarized.}},

Abstract = {{Building ``disaster-resilient{''} rather than ``disaster-resistant{''}
   cities/communities requires the development of response capabilities to
   natural disasters and subsequent recovery. This study devises a new
   method to measure resilience via recovery capability to validate
   indicators from social, economic, infrastructural, and environmental
   domains. The pollutant discharge data (waste-water and waste-gas
   discharge/emission data) of local power plants, sewage treatment plants
   and main factories were used to monitor recovery process of both
   people's living and local industrial production as the waste water/gas
   is released irregularly during the short disaster-hit period. A time
   series analysis of such data was employed to detect the disturbance on
   these infrastructures from disasters and to assess community recovery
   capability. A recent record-breaking flash flood in Changzhou, a city in
   eastern-central China, was selected as a case study. We used ordinal
   logistic regression to identify leading proxies of flood resilience. A
   combination of six variables related to socioeconomic factors,
   infrastructure development and the environment, stood out and explained
   61.4\% of the variance in measured recovery capability. These findings
   substantiate the possibility of using recovery measurement based on
   pollutant discharge to validate resilience metrics, and contribute more
   solid evidences for policy-makers and urban planners to make
   corresponding measures for resilience enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years, natural hazards related to flash floods have caused
   serious damage and losses to the population of the state of Rio de
   Janeiro. This research discusses the importance of implementing a
   methodology for the prevention of flash floods, by comparing the methods
   applied since 2013 in the city of Duque de Caxias, in the Baixada
   Fluminense region of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the major
   prevention actions suggested by the Flash Flood Early Warning System
   Reference Guide from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration, questioning civil defense professionals about the
   importance of each method to vulnerable communities. Even without the
   occurrence of an extreme event that proves the effectiveness of the
   method between 2014 and 2016, the population will certainly be better
   prepared to face the risks of disasters in the city in the future. In
   addition, the study also underscores an approach of approximation
   between academic studies and operational activities, which is still very
   incipient in Brazil.}},

Title = {{Identifying the Risk Areas and Urban Growth by ArcGIS-Tools}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Abouelreesh is one of the most at risk areas in Aswan, Egypt, which
   suffers from storms, poor drainage, and flash flooding. These phenomena
   affect the urban areas and cause a lot of damage to buildings and
   infrastructure. Moreover, the potential for the further realization of
   dangerous situations increased when the urban areas of Abouelreesh
   extended towards the risk areas. In an effort to ameliorate the danger,
   two key issues for urban growth management were studied, namely: (i)
   estimations regarding the pace of urban sprawl, and (ii) the
   identification of urban areas located in regions that would be affected
   by flash floods. Analyzing these phenomena require a lot of data in
   order to obtain good results, but in our case, the official data or
   field data was limited so we tried to obtain it by accessing two kinds
   of free sources of satellite data. First, we used Arc GIS tools to
   analyze (digital elevation model (DEM)) files in order to study the
   watershed and better identify the risk area. Second, we studied
   historical imagery in Google Earth to determine the age of each urban
   block. The urban growth rate in the risk areas had risen to 63.31\% in
   2001. Urban growth in the case study area had been influenced by house
   sizes, because most people were looking to live in bigger houses. The
   aforementioned problem can be observed by considering the increasing
   average house sizes from 2001 until 2013, where, especially in risky
   areas, the average of house sizes had grown from 223 m(2) in 2001 to 318
   m(2) in 2013. The findings from this study would be useful to urban
   planners and government officials in helping them to make informed
   decisions on urban development to benefit the community, especially
   those living in areas at risk from flash flooding from heavy rain
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Among the natural hazards, flash flooding is the leading cause of
   weather-related deaths. Flood risk management (FRM) in this context
   requires a comprehensive assessment of the social risk component. In
   this regard, integrated social vulnerability (ISV) can incorporate
   spatial distribution and contribution and the combined effect of
   exposure, sensitivity and resilience to total vulnerability, although
   these components are often disregarded. ISV is defined by the
   demographic and socio-economic characteristics that condition a
   population's capacity to cope with, resist and recover from risk and can
   be expressed as the integrated social vulnerability index (ISVI). This
   study describes a methodological approach towards constructing the ISVI
   in urban areas prone to flash flooding in Castilla y Leon (Castile and
   Leon, northern central Spain, 94 223 km(2), 2 478 376 inhabitants). A
   hierarchical segmentation analysis (HSA) was performed prior to the
   principal components analysis (PCA), which helped to overcome the sample
   size limitation inherent in PCA. ISVI was obtained from weighting
   vulnerability factors based on the tolerance statistic. In addition,
   latent class cluster analysis (LCCA) was carried out to identify spatial
   patterns of vulnerability within the study area. Our results show that
   the ISVI has high spatial variability. Moreover, the source of
   vulnerability in each urban area cluster can be identified from LCCA.
   These findings make it possible to design tailor-made strategies for
   FRM, thereby increasing the efficiency of plans and policies and helping
   to reduce the cost of mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Urban flooding is a gradually increasing problem as the urban population
   expands into floodplains. In urban environments, flood vulnerability is
   significantly increased as a more concentrated population and assets
   makes flooding costly and challenging, in terms of impact estimation.
   This work focuses on mapping and classifying impacts after the
   catastrophic 2014 flood in Athens, Greece. The study proposes a method
   for classifying flood effects into four categories including: the
   natural and built environment, mobile objects and human population,
   organized in five classes of increasing severity, i.e. minor, weak,
   moderate, strong and extreme. Flood effects are grouped based on the
   qualitative nature of the recorded effects, allowing the development of
   an impact-severity map. Mapping of the 2014 flood effects indicated
   specific locations where the severity of impacts was distinctively
   higher than others, providing a holistic overview of the flood's effects
   and highlighting the usefulness of the approach in future flood
   protection planning.}},

Abstract = {{Recent flash flood impact studies highlight that road networks are often
   disrupted due to adverse weather and flash flood events. Road users are
   thus particularly exposed to road flooding during their daily mobility.
   Previous exposure studies, however, do not take into consideration
   population mobility. Recent advances in transportation research provide
   an appropriate framework for simulating individual travelactivity
   patterns using an activity-based approach. These activity-based mobility
   models enable the prediction of the sequence of activities performed by
   individuals and locating them with a high spatial-temporal resolution.
   This paper describes the development of the MobRISK microsimulation
   system: a model for assessing the exposure of road users to extreme
   hydrometeorological events. MobRISK aims at providing an accurate
   spatiotemporal exposure assessment by integrating travel-activity
   behaviors and mobility adaptation with respect to weather disruptions.
   The model is applied in a flash-flood-prone area in southern France to
   assess motorists' exposure to the September 2002 flash flood event. The
   results show that risk of flooding mainly occurs in principal road links
   with considerable traffic load. However, a lag time between the timing
   of the road submersion and persons crossing these roads contributes to
   reducing the potential vehicle-related fatal accidents. It is also found
   that sociodemographic variables have a significant effect on individual
   exposure. Thus, the proposed model demonstrates the benefits of
   considering spatiotemporal dynamics of population exposure to flash
   floods and presents an important improvement in exposure assessment
   methods. Such improved characterization of road user exposures can
   present valuable information for flood risk management services.}},

Abstract = {{Computer Vision and Image Processing are emerging research paradigms.
   The increasing popularity of social media, micro-blogging services and
   ubiquitous availability of high-resolution smartphone cameras with
   pervasive connectivity are propelling our digital footprints and cyber
   activities. Such online human footprints related with an
   event-of-interest, if mined appropriately, can provide meaningful
   information to analyze the current course and pre- and post-impact
   leading to the organizational planning of various real-time smart city
   applications. In this paper, we investigate the narrative (texts) and
   visual (images) components of Twitter feeds to improve the results of
   queries by exploiting the deep contexts of each data modality. We employ
   Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)-based techniques to analyze the texts and
   Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) to analyze the images which help
   establish the cross-correlations between the textual and image
   dimensions of a query. While each of the data dimensions helps improve
   the results of a specific query on its own, the contributions from the
   dual modalities can potentially provide insights that are greater than
   what can be obtained from the individual modalities. We validate our
   proposed approach using real Twitter feeds from a recent devastating
   flash flood in Ellicott City near the University of Maryland campus. Our
   results show that the images and texts can be classified with 67\% and
   94\% accuracies respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Floods and landslides are frequent and destructive geo-hydrological
   hazards that cause harm to people every year. We analysed data on 1292
   landslide and 771 flood fatalities that occurred in Italy in the 50-year
   period 1965-2014, to determine the dependence of the fatalities on
   gender and age and the circumstances of death by type of hazard. The
   multinomial probability mass function of the expected fatalities by
   gender and age, as reported by national census data, were estimated and
   compared with the observed landslide and flood fatalities. We identified
   the age categories over or under represented when the observed
   fatalities were respectively higher or lower than the modelled expected
   deaths. We found that in Italy males are more vulnerable to floods and
   landslides for most of the age categories. Apart from children, males
   are over-represented up to the age of 89 for floods and up to 79 for
   landslides, whereas females are under-represented up to the age of 59
   for floods and landslides, and over-represented above 70 for floods and
   between 60 and 79 for landslides. To consider the demographic and
   socio-cultural changes over time, we performed a temporal analysis
   splitting the record into two non-overlapping subsets of 25 year each.
   The analysis demonstrated that the over-representation of males compared
   to the females, both for landslide and flood is statistically
   significant and does not vary in time, indicating a different propensity
   towards the risk taking and a different degree of exposure between males
   and females. Analysis of the data allowed to identify the common
   circumstances of death. Landslides fatalities occurred frequently
   indoor, whereas the majority of the flood fatalities occurred outdoor,
   outlining the different dynamics of the hazards. Floods killed numerous
   people along roads and drivers or passengers travelling in vehicles. We
   expect that the results of this work will be helpful to design
   recommendations for self-protecting actions, and proactive policies that
   can contribute to reduce the human toll of floods and landslides in
   Italy, and elsewhere. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Desert environments are subject to flash floods in wadi floors, which
   may occur only once every decade or two in a given wadi (dry channels or
   valleys, except during rains). In areas of rapid growth, flood-prone
   areas can become urbanized in the time between floods. Being flat and
   constituted of sandy sediments, unlike the surrounding terrain, wadi
   floors are often used for construction, exposing the new settlements to
   flood risks. We present a case study of the town of El-Sheikh El-Shazli,
   in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, which has undergone increasingly rapid
   development over the past two decades. The town is named for an
   important 13th-century Sufi leader whose shrine receives thousands of
   visitors annually. We document the extent and effects of the last flash
   flood (1996) from interviews, field measurement of flood debris, and
   patterns in satellite imagery; these show the extent of new development
   in flood-prone wadi floors and the potential risks to residents and
   visitors in the absence of proper planning. We then recommend measures
   to reduce the future loss of life and damage from flooding.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change will impact urban infrastructure networks by changing
   precipitation patterns in a region. This study presents a novel
   vulnerability assessment framework for infrastructure networks against
   extreme rainfall-induced flash floods, with a specific application to
   transportation. The framework combines climate models, network science,
   geographical information systems (GIS), and stochastic modeling to
   compile a vulnerability surface (VS). Daily precipitation simulations
   for 2006-2100 from the Community Climate System Model, version 4
   (CCSM4), are used to produce a stochastic simulation of extreme flash
   flood events in five U.S. cities-that is, Boston, Massachusetts;
   Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and
   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-under two different climate scenarios (RCP4.5
   and RCP8.5). To assess the impact of these events, percentage drops in
   static (i.e., overall properties and robustness topological indicators)
   and dynamic (i.e., GIS accessibility and travel demand metrics) network
   properties are measured before and after simulated extreme events. The
   results of these metrics are inputs on a radar diagram to form a VS.
   Overall, the results show that changes in flash flood frequency due to
   climate change can have a significant impact on road networks, as was
   demonstrated recently in Houston, Texas. The magnitude of these impacts
   is chiefly associated with the geographic location of the cities and the
   size of the networks. The proposed framework can be reproduced in any
   city around the world, and researchers can use the results as guidelines
   for infrastructure design and planning purposes. Moreover, sensitivity
   analysis to varying greenhouse gas concentration trajectories can help
   local and national authorities to prioritize strategies for adaptation
   to climate change in more vulnerable regions.}},

Abstract = {{Mongolia is a mostly arid or semiarid country, so it might seem strange
   that floods could be one of the disaster threats it faces. However, the
   low precipitation and high evaporation of surface water are a result of
   the low absorptive capacity of the soil, and, accordingly, higher than
   normal precipitation often results in run-offs, which have the potential
   to become flash floods. In a peripheral area of Ulaanbaatar, the capital
   municipality of Mongolia, residential areas called ger areas have
   expanded rapidly in an unplanned manner because of the poor execution of
   land reform policy, and considerable migration has resulted from a
   natural hazarddzud. These areas have been encroaching on
   flash-flood-prone areas, which have resulted in a dozen people losing
   their lives in 2009. This chapter introduces the background of ger areas
   expansion and reveals the actual situation of their spatial distribution
   over fl ash-flood-prone areas using VHR satellite imageries.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter analyzes the flood disasters and effectiveness of land use
   planning and enforcement in Swat Valley, eastern Hindu Kush, north
   Pakistan. In Swat Valley, flooding is a recurrently occurring
   phenomenon. In upper reaches flash flood characteristics dominate, while
   downstream Madyan river flooding dominates the scene. Downstream Madyan,
   Swat River enters into a wide basin and braided into numerous channels.
   The meandering river is frequently changing its course. In Swat Valley,
   almost every year in summer, the peak discharge overflows the natural
   levees and in effect causes damages to scarce agricultural land,
   housing, and other sectors. While in certain areas, deep riverbank
   erosion is very active and engulfing the farmland and built-up areas.
   Primarily, the active floodplain of Swat River was a vast grazing land,
   but with passage of time, the increasing population has used it for
   cultivation and other developments without taking into consideration
   risk of floods. This in turn has enhanced the flood vulnerability to
   various developments. For centuries people lived within the valley of
   Swat River with the reality of flooding as a natural hazard and with the
   fact that it has a potential to cause damages to people and their
   belongings, but so for no attention has been given to land use
   regulation and zoning. Land use regulations have been widely used as a
   non-structural flood mitigation strategy in reducing exposure of people
   and their property. It was found from the analysis that frequent human
   encroachments onto the flood channel and absence of land use regulations
   have been identified as the major factors responsible for heavy flood
   losses. Looking into potential and challenges in land use planning, this
   is high time to undertake fluvial morphology and rainfall-runoff model
   for flood risk assessment and spatial land use planning.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal towns along the coast of Africa are among the most vulnerable to
   climate change impacts such as flooding and sea level rise. Yet, because
   coastal conditions in many parts of the region are poorly understood,
   knowledge on which population groups are at the most risk is less known,
   particularly in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) of Ghana,
   where the capital city Accra is located. Without adequate information
   about the risk levels and why, the implementation of locally appropriate
   adaptation plans may be less effective. This study enriches our
   understanding of the levels of flood risks along the coast of GAMA and
   contributes knowledge to improve understanding of place-specific
   adaptation plans. The study uses data from a 300-household survey,
   stakeholder meetings, and interviews with local community leaders to
   construct an integrated vulnerability index. The index includes seven
   components made up of: dwelling type; house and house environment;
   household socioeconomic characteristics; experience and perception of
   flood risk; household and community flood adaptation strategies; house
   location, and physical characteristics. Our findings show that exposure
   to floods, particularly from local flash floods is relatively high in
   all communities. However, significant differences in sensitivity and
   adaptive capacity of the communities were observed due to differences in
   location, socioeconomic characteristics, and perception of risks to
   flooding and sea level rise. The complexity of factors involved in the
   determination of local-level vulnerability requires that the
   implementation of adaptation strategies needs to involve cross-sectorial
   partnerships, involving local communities, in building a comprehensive
   multi-risk adaptation strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The projected frequent occurrences of extreme flood events will cause
   significant losses to crops and will threaten food security. To reduce
   the potential risk and provide support for agricultural flood
   management, prevention, and mitigation, it is important to account for
   flood damage to crop production and to understand the relationship
   between flood.characteristics and crop losses. A quantitative and
   effective evaluation tool is therefore essential to explore what and how
   flood characteristics will affect the associated crop loss, based on
   accurately understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood evolution
   and crop growth. Current evaluation methods are generally integrally or
   qualitatively based on statistic data or ex-post survey with less
   diagnosis into the process and dynamics of historical flood events.
   Therefore, a quantitative and spatial evaluation framework is presented
   in this study that integrates remote sensing imagery and hydraulic model
   simulation to facilitate the identification of historical flood
   characteristics that influence crop losses. Remote sensing imagery can
   capture the spatial variation of crop yields and yield losses from
   floods on a grid scale over large areas; however, it is incapable of
   providing spatial information regarding flood progress. Two-dimensional
   hydraulic model can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff and
   accomplish spatial and temporal quantification of flood characteristics
   on a grid scale over watersheds, i.e., flow velocity and flood duration.
   The methodological framework developed herein includes the following:
   (a) Vegetation indices for the critical period of crop growth from
   mid-high temporal and spatial remote sensing imagery in association with
   agricultural statistics data were used to develop empirical models to
   monitor the crop yield and evaluate yield losses from flood; (b) The
   two-dimensional hydraulic model coupled with the SCS-CN hydrologic model
   was employed to simulate the flood evolution process, with the SCS-CN
   model as a rainfall-runoff generator and the two-dimensional hydraulic
   model implementing the routing scheme for surface runoff; and (c) The
   spatial combination between crop yield losses and flood dynamics on a
   grid scale can be used to investigate the relationship between the
   intensity of flood characteristics and associated loss extent. The
   modeling framework was applied for a 50-year return period flood that
   occurred in Jilin province, Northeast China, which caused large
   agricultural losses in August 2013. The modeling results indicated that
   (a) the flow velocity was the most influential factor that caused spring
   corn, rice and soybean yield losses from extreme storm event in the
   mountainous regions; (b) the power function archived the best results
   that fit the velocity-loss relationship for mountainous areas; and (c)
   integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling
   approach are helpful for evaluating the influence of historical flood
   event on crop production and investigating the relationship between
   flood characteristics and crop yield losses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The northeastern region of Bangladesh often experiences flash flooding
   during the pre-harvesting period of the boro rice crop, which is the
   major cereal crop in the country. In this study, our objective was to
   delineate the impact of the 2017 flash flood (that initiated on 27 March
   2017) on boro rice using multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS data.
   Initially, we opted to use Landsat-8 OLI data for mapping the damages;
   however, during and after the flooding event the acquisition of cloud
   free images were challenging. Thus, we used this data to map the
   cultivated boro rice acreage considering the planting to mature stages
   of the crop. Also, in order to map the extent of the damaged boro area,
   we utilized MODIS data as their 16-day composites provided cloud free
   information. Our results indicated that both the cultivated and damaged
   boro area estimates based on satellite data had strong relationships
   while compared to the ground-based estimates (i.e., r(2) values
   approximately 0.92 for both cases, and RMSE of 18,374 and 9380 ha for
   cultivated and damaged areas, respectively). Finally, we believe that
   our study would be critical for planning and ensuring food security for
   the country.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most vulnerable parts to natural hazards in Serbia is
   Kolubara river basin. In the past, during the period from 1929 to 2013,
   121 torrential flood events in the Kolubara river basin were recorded
   which show that this territory is extremely vulnerable to the torrential
   floods. The extreme event which occurred in May 2014 causing the
   catastrophic material damages and casualties was the latest and
   historical flood. The analysis of natural conditions in the Kolubara
   basin uniformly showed that this area is predisposed to a greater number
   of torrential floods due to its geomorphological, hydrological and land
   use properties. Torrential floods are closely related to the intensity
   and spatial distribution of erosive processes in the upper part of the
   Kolubara basin. The estimation of soil erosion potential is generally
   achieved by Erosion Potential Model (EPM). For the purposes of
   determining the degree of torrential properties in various water streams
   in the Kolubara basin, the calculation of susceptibility to torrential
   floods was assessed by Flash Flood Potential Index (FFPI). More than
   half of the basin area (57.2\%) is located within the category of very
   weak and weak erosion (Z(sr) = 0.35), but the category of medium erosion
   is geospatially very common. Such a distribution of medium erosion
   category provides conditions for generating, i.e. production of sediment
   which would boost torrential properties of water streams. After the
   classification of the obtained FFPI values it was determined that 25\%
   of the Kolubara basin is very susceptible to torrents and this data
   should be seriously taken into consideration. Based on the analyses, the
   best and most successful manner of defence is prevention which consists
   of the integrated river basin management system (integrated torrent
   control system) so that technical works in hydrographic networks of
   torrents and biological and biotechnical works on the slope of the basin
   would be the best solution. Permanent control of erosive and torrential
   processes in the river basin will be not only important for flood
   control but it can also protect the existing and future water reservoirs
   and retentions from siltation with erosion sediment which is of great
   significance to the water management, agriculture, energy sector, and
   the entire society.}},

Abstract = {{On June 1st, 2016, in Simbach am Inn, Germany a flash flood occured. The
   event originated after heavy rainfall in the river Simbach and caused
   five fatalities and severe damages on residential, non-residential
   properties and infrastructure. During this event the failure of a road
   dam and a lateral dyke lead to a sudden increase of the discharge within
   the town. On behalf of the Bavarian Environment Agency this flash flood
   was investigated in order to evaluate the impact of these failures. It
   may be evidenced that the flooded area with or without the failures is
   more or less the same, but the flow depths differ about half a meter
   within the town.}},

Abstract = {{Many cities and urban areas are located in flood plains because land is
   fertile and flat which is suitable for agriculture and urban
   development. Rivers provide water supply for domestic, industrial and
   irrigation uses; they also provide convenient means for navigation,
   transportation and communication. Cities have large percentage of
   impervious areas that prevent effective infiltration of rainfall into
   soil. To have successful flood control and flood risk management, we
   should consider not only hydraulic and engineering aspects but also
   socio-economic and environment aspects. Flood management should have
   involvement of various stakeholders including concerned authorities such
   as urban planners, civil and water resources engineers, civil disaster
   defence authorities, health and social services, etc. The best flood
   mitigation measures from all main points of view - social, economic and
   environmental are natural water retention measures. Natural water
   retention measures cover a diversity of measures that are implemented by
   different sectors or considered in different planning processes dealing
   with water, food risk management, biodiversity protection, climate
   change adaptation or urban planning. Some of these measures aim to
   directly modify the ecosystem, while others focus on changes of practice
   of economic operators. The paper presents natural water retention
   measures suitable for application in urban areas. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Flash floods are caused by intense rainfall events and represent an
   insufficiently understood phenomenon in Germany. As a result of higher
   precipitation intensities, flash floods might occur more frequently in
   future. In combination with changing land use patterns and urbanisation,
   damage mitigation, insurance and risk management in flash-flood-prone
   regions are becoming increasingly important. However, a better
   understanding of damage caused by flash floods requires ex post
   collection of relevant but yet sparsely available information for
   research. At the end of May 2016, very high and concentrated rainfall
   intensities led to severe flash floods in several southern German
   municipalities. The small town of Braunsbach stood as a prime example of
   the devastating potential of such events. Eight to ten days after the
   flash flood event, damage assessment and data collection were conducted
   in Braunsbach by investigating all affected buildings and their
   surroundings. To record and store the data on site, the open-source
   software bundle KoBoCollect was used as an efficient and easy way to
   gather information. Since the damage driving factors of flash floods are
   expected to differ from those of riverine flooding, a post-hoc data
   analysis was performed, aiming to identify the influence of flood
   processes and building attributes on damage grades, which reflect the
   extent of structural damage. Data analyses include the application of
   random forest, a random general linear model and multinomial logistic
   regression as well as the construction of a local impact map to reveal
   influences on the damage grades. Further, a Spearman's Rho correlation
   matrix was calculated. The results reveal that the damage driving
   factors of flash floods differ from those of riverine floods to a
   certain extent. The exposition of a building in flow direction shows an
   especially strong correlation with the damage grade and has a high
   predictive power within the constructed damage models. Additionally, the
   results suggest that building materials as well as various building
   aspects, such as the existence of a shop window and the surroundings,
   might have an effect on the resulting damage. To verify and confirm the
   outcomes as well as to support future mitigation strategies, risk
   management and planning, more comprehensive and systematic data
   collection is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal regions are the areas most threatened by natural hazards, with
   floods being the most frequent and significant threat in terms of their
   induced impacts, and therefore, any management scheme requires their
   evaluation. In coastal areas, flooding is a hazard associated with
   various processes acting at different scales: coastal storms, flash
   floods, and sea level rise (SLR). In order to address the problem as a
   whole, this study presents a methodology to undertake a preliminary
   integrated risk assessment that determines the magnitude of the
   different flood processes (flash flood, marine storm, SLR) and their
   associated consequences, taking into account their temporal and spatial
   scales. The risk is quantified using specific indicators to assess the
   magnitude of the hazard (for each component) and the consequences in a
   common scale. This allows for a robust comparison of the spatial risk
   distribution along the coast in order to identify both the areas at
   greatest risk and the risk components that have the greatest impact.
   This methodology is applied on the Maresme coast (NW Mediterranean,
   Spain), which can be considered representative of developed areas of the
   Spanish Mediterranean coast. The results obtained characterise this
   coastline as an area of relatively low overall risk, although some hot
   spots have been identified with high-risk values, with flash flooding
   being the principal risk process.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are one of the most disastrous natural hazards and cause
   serious loss of life and economic damage every year. Flooding frequently
   affects many regions in China, including periodically catastrophic
   events. An extensive compilation of the available data has been
   conducted across various hydroclimatological regions to analyze the
   spatiotemporal characteristics of flash floods in China. This inventory
   includes over 782 documented events and is the first step toward
   establishing an atlas of extreme flash flood occurrences in China. This
   paper first presents the data compilation strategy, details of the
   database contents, and the typical examples of first-hand analysis
   results. The subsequent analysis indicates that the most extreme flash
   floods originate mainly from small catchments over complex terrains and
   results in dominantly small- and medium-sized flooding events in terms
   of scales; however, these events, abrupt and seasonally recurrent in
   nature, account for a large proportion of the overall flooding-related
   disasters, especially disproportionately affecting elderly and youth
   populations. Finally, this study also recommends several immediate
   measures could be implemented to mitigate high impacts of deadly flash
   floods, although it still requires long-term significant efforts to
   protect human life and property in a country like China.}},

Abstract = {{The frequent extreme weather events have led to dramatic urban
   waterlogging and flash flood hazards in recent years, which result in
   heavy casualties and serious economic losses. Mountainous cities like
   Fuzhou, China, usually experience both types of hazard concurrently and
   are susceptible to these hazards. Therefore, it is necessary to take
   comprehensive defense measures to prevent and/or mitigate the impacts of
   these hazards. In this study, the authors first reviewed the progress of
   prevention measures of these two types of hazards in China through the
   nationwide construction of sponge cities and national flash flood
   prevention projects. The authors then analyzed the characteristics of
   waterlogging and flash flood hazards in China using 25years of records
   from the Chinese government and elaborated the causes and existing
   issues. Results show that flash floods and urban waterlogging in
   mountainous cities have exacerbated the severity of flood hazards. Based
   on the typical effective measures of such flood hazard prevention
   systems, the authors also discussed the possible comprehensive
   preventive measures to be implemented in Fuzhou via the spongy city
   construction, which can provide a reference for future flood management.}},

Abstract = {{Transport resilience is an important area of research in the global
   effort to adapt to climate change. This paper introduces and applies a
   stochastic modeling methodology to assess the impact of multihazard
   events. Most cities are exposed to multiple types of extreme events,
   sometimes simultaneously, and focusing on single events may lead to
   inadequate design recommendations. By assigning failure probabilities of
   road segments and by estimating road failure through Monte Carlo
   simulation, roads and areas that are particularly vulnerable to
   multihazard events can be detected. The performance of the large-scale
   road network of the Tokai region in Japan (prone to both typhoons and
   earthquakes) is analyzed by considering three scenarios of hazards:
   flash flood, earthquake, and the combination of both hazards. The model
   considers two key traffic performance characteristics: postdisaster
   reduced road capacity and hourly variations in travel demand. Overall,
   several areas in the region are found to be currently severely at risk,
   thus providing direct information that can help authorities test the
   effectiveness of future road infrastructure projects. (c) 2017 American

Abstract = {{Flash floods are natural hazards that may last only a few hours, but
   their sudden onset often results in severe impacts on society and the
   environment. Therefore, efforts to reduce flash flood-related losses
   have primarily focused on the compilation of emergency operation plans
   (EOPs). Conversely, there have been only a few attempts to provide
   cartographic representations of EOPs in order to show the spatial
   context of crisis operations. In the present map and its commentary, we
   describe a pilot study of flash flood household labelling for use in
   emergency operations carried out in Chrastava town, Northern Czechia.
   Analyses of existing geographical databases, together with detailed
   field surveys, have been performed to map relevant characteristics of
   1110 buildings in terms of their location, function, number of residents
   and degree of flood hazard, as well as the presence of flood-protection
   measures. The map sheet is composed of the main map (overview of flood
   extent and impacts) and three supplementary maps (technical and social
   vulnerability of buildings), and the map key is designed to facilitate
   strategic planning and directing of emergency operations in the study
   area.}},

Title = {{Global mortality from storm surges is decreasing}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Changes in society's vulnerability to natural hazards are important to
   understand, as they determine current and future risks, and the need to
   improve protection. Very large impacts including high numbers of
   fatalities occur due to single storm surge flood events. Here, we report
   on impacts of global coastal storm surge events since the year 1900,
   based on a compilation of events and data on loss of life. We find that
   over the past, more than eight thousand people are killed and 1.5
   million people are affected annually by storm surges. The occurrence of
   very substantial loss of life (>10 000 persons) from single events has
   however decreased over time. Moreover, there is a consistent decrease in
   event mortality, measured by the fraction of exposed people that are
   killed, for all global regions, except South East Asia. Average
   mortality for storm surges is slightly higher than for river floods, but
   lower than for flash floods. We also find that for the same coastal
   surge water level, mortality has decreased over time. This indicates
   that risk reduction efforts have been successful, but need to be
   continued with projected climate change, increased rates of sea-level
   rise and urbanisation in coastal zones.}},

   in India}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{48-56}},

Abstract = {{Post-disaster rehabilitation and rebuilding efforts are oftentimes
   spearheaded by government agencies rather hastily, to meet the urgent
   demands of disaster survivors. However in the absence of pre-planning
   for disaster recovery, they may increase community vulnerabilities due
   to a break down in social ties and livelihood needs. There is a growing
   recognition that adhoc top down policies should be replaced with an
   understanding of the preferences and needs of disaster survivors. This
   research is aimed at gauging the intended mitigation strategies that
   survivors from the Himalayan region of North India expressed, following
   the devastating flash flooding in 2013. A semi-structured questionnaire
   was used to interview 316 residents from 17 villages in the State of
   Uttarakhand to measure demographic characteristics, risk perception,
   prior flash flood hazard experience, evacuation experience, damage to
   home, and intended structural (relocate/building back better) and
   non-structural (investing time and effort in emergency planning or
   raising self-awareness and knowledge of threats knowledge) mitigation
   measures. Findings suggest that relocation is not a preferred mitigation
   strategy. Rather, an overwhelming majority of the respondents are
   interested in emergency planning at the household and village levels.
   Investing in revising and updating the plans at all levels of
   government, reviewing the existing forecasting and warning system and
   creating a robust risk communication plan with local input, strictly
   enforcing the provisions of flood Plain Zoning Act, 2012, improving
   hazard awareness programs and creating village level task forces with
   direct linkages to the State disaster Management Agency are some of the
   recommendations made.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure development and industrialisation have led to an ever
   increasing demand for energy and tremendous generation of industrial and
   municipal solid wastes in India. With indiscriminate human
   encroachments, the impact of disasters such as rainfall-induced
   landslides, river/ coastal erosion, flash floods and cloud bursts is
   quite high. In order to minimise the harmful impact of these issues,
   there needs to be development of sustainable optimal solutions, which
   are best suited to the regions concerned, employment of new construction
   materials like geosynthetics and state-of-the-art techniques. As such,
   in dealing with such problems that have direct bearing on
   geoenvironment, an interdisciplinary approach needs to be developed,
   which is the starting point of environmental geotechnology as `applied
   science to research and resolve'. In view of this, this paper discusses
   a few key geoenvironmental engineering issues and challenges pertaining
   to the Indian context.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in analytical flood modelling need to be accompanied by similar
   advances in the means by which model results can be disseminated across
   a wide range of stakeholder groups. In this paper, we exemplify the use
   of Adobe Flash as a means to design interactive flood mapping methods
   that can portray a wide range of potential flood levels, and place them
   into a context of flood frequency. We apply this methodology to a
   coastal flood-prone locality in Australia, integrating a range of
   flood-related information into a single intuitive interface. We
   demonstrate how a temporal dimension can be incorporated to represent
   future changes to inundation probability based on climate change
   projections of sea-level rise. The resulting visualisation is accessible
   directly via the web, and is designed for ease of use and understanding
   for all stakeholders. Such flexible methods of representing flood hazard
   can foster education on flood issues, support community decision-making
   and assist emergency response when floods eventuate. In this way, such
   mapping methods can play a vital role in integrated coastal zone
   management initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{Debris flows and flash floods pose a continuing hazard to Nyalindung, a
   village in a mountainous part of West Java. On 16 December 2013, three
   days of heavy rain and a partial breaching of a succession of landslide
   dams triggered a debris flow and flash flood. One person died, nine
   homes were damaged, and 53 residents were evacuated. We asked villagers
   who were directly affected by that disaster about their knowledge of the
   hazard, in the hope of developing adaptation strategies. The survey
   showed that the majority of the villagers first became aware of the
   hazard during the 2013 disaster. Practical solutions exclude relocation
   because the village has stood in flow paths for the past 70 years or
   more, and because the families residing there are attached to the land
   and each other. We recommend combining public education about existing
   hazards with early warning technology.}},

Abstract = {{Change of climate is unequivocal, and many of the observed changes are
   unprecedented over five decades to millennia. It is expected that the
   global atmosphere and ocean is increasingly getting warmer, the amount
   of ice on the earth is decreasing over the oceans, and the sea level has
   risen. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, such
   temperature change is around 0.78 degrees C over decades. Without
   international collaboration towards Paris Agreement, the temperature
   change could potentially rise over 5.5 degrees C in 2100. In addition,
   it is highly likely that even such a small change can trigger the worst
   of other extreme natural threats to interdependent urban and transport
   infrastructure systems. The vulnerability of those infrastructure
   systems has not been comprehensively addressed in open literature due to
   the fact that the actual climate change impact depends on specific
   differences of local environmental and geographical conditions. As a
   result, our research will highlight the extremes that can lead to system
   failure, degraded operation and ultimately, delays to train services.
   The emphasis is placed on the newly proposed Malaysia-Singapore high
   speed rail network, which can be affected by the most-frequent severe
   weather conditions including heavy rainfall and flash flood. It is found
   that tunnelling, steep cutting and ballast foundation are ones of the
   most vulnerable assets from a heavy rainfall or a flash flood.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, both human and material damages caused by different types
   of flooding in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) were determined for
   the first time. Human damages (fatalities, evacuated and displaced
   people) were obtained from the DISASTER database (1865-2010 period).
   Material damages' estimation was obtained from the Portuguese
   Association of Insurers database for the period 2000-2010. A
   classification of types of flooding based on the hydrological/physical
   features of the territory separating fluvial floods (slow and flash
   floods) from urban flooding (related and unrelated to the ancient
   natural drainage network-FREN and FUNN) was used. Topographic maps from
   the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1:10,000 and 1:25,000 scales),
   information from newspapers and daily rainfall data were used to define
   this classification and to validate the flooding occurrences. It was
   concluded that: (1) during 146 years, 131 flooding events with human
   damages occurred in the LMA; (2) 120 flooding events with material
   damages were registered in 1781 places for 11 years; (3) the spatial
   distribution of human and material damages was very different; (4) each
   type of flooding caused distinct human and material damages; (5) the
   importance of each type of flooding varied over time due to human
   interventions in the territory; (6) there is a clear decrease in the
   mortality associated with flooding even during the extreme flooding
   events. This study contributes for spatial planning and insurance
   companies, allowing to define the temporal evolution and spatial
   patterns of the types of flooding, as well as to understand their future
   damages.}},

Abstract = {{The regional phenomenon of heavy rainfall under global climate change is
   extremely likely to induce flash floods in flood-prone urban areas and
   endanger the lives and safety of residents. Due to its low-lying land
   and the overdevelopment of urban areas, Hsinchuang District in New
   Taipei City, situated in the Taliaokeng River basin, is subject to
   routine flooding on some of its streets after heavy rainfall in a
   changing climate. Faced with the challenge, this study provides insights
   into risk perceptions of flood-prone communities that should be factored
   in risk communication to foster adaptive actions in responding to
   climate change. It is underscored that community perception of climate
   change is a factor in increasing local awareness of climate risk. The
   study used Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) cause-effect
   model as the information flow framework to assess community
   vulnerability and risk perceptions throughout semi-structured interview
   process. The focus was put on how the community risk perceptions were
   shaped in the context of social amplification of risk in responding to
   climate change. This methodological approach underscores community risk
   perceptions are an inherent part of the decision-making process, and
   helps to enhance adaptive actions of flood-prone communities. The study
   also underlined the risk communication in groups and social networks
   that contribute to the integration of structural and non-structural
   measures to advance understanding of community risk perceptions of
   future climate.}},

Abstract = {{Pluvial flash flood (PFF) can cause serious traffic disruption in big
   cities. We conducted interdisciplinary research by integrating flood
   modeling and traffic analysis to reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of
   the interplay between these two processes. A simplified simulation tool,
   which is capable of building a road network model, assigning trip paths
   with the effect of road closures, and evaluating travel delay and
   vehicle volume redistribution in a given PFF scenario, was developed to
   capture the traffic disruption in the face of PFF events. Modeling
   outputs from a case study in the city center of Shanghai showed that the
   delay of vehicles diverted to dry links or trapped in flooded links may
   reach 0.5 to 8 times the travel time in no-flood scenarios. Overall,
   approximately 1-7\% of vehicle volumes on flooded links would be
   redistributed onto dry links (more likely major arterial roads).
   However, the vehicle volume variation during each time interval
   demonstrated evident disparity with the spatiotemporal change of flood
   inundations. Simulating and mapping the congestion can largely
   facilitate the identification of vulnerable links. Future research will
   test the method in other intra-urban areas and try to bridge the gap
   between modeling outputs and smart city planning and management.}},

Title = {{PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE NOVEMBER 10, 2014 RAINSTORM AND RELATED

Abstract = {{On the evening of November 10, 2014, eight rainfall-induced shallow
   landslides were triggered on a slope in the lower Lavagna valley
   (eastern Liguria, Italy). Most of the shallow landslides were channelled
   as flows into steep hollows and reached the toe of the slope, where some
   sparse houses were built. One of these landslides impacted and destroyed
   a building located just at a steep channel outlet, causing two
   fatalities. Damage affected also agricultural terracing as well as some
   other buildings and a road running at the toe of the slope, which was
   buried for long tracts by landslide deposits.
   Since a few days after the landslides occurrence, various activities
   were carried out, with the aim of better understanding both the
   triggering and predisposing factors of landslides. These activities
   included field surveys, rainfall data analysis, topographic/thematic
   maps, DEM and aerial photo analyses, preliminary laboratory tests on
   soil samples.
   From the analyses performed, it seems that, in addition to the rainfall
   characteristics of the November 10, 2014 event, the antecedent rainfall
   may have played an important role as landslides predisposing factor.
   Other relevant predisposing factors can be referred to slope steepness,
   presence of hollows, stratigraphic and structural settings at the source
   areas and lack of maintenance of terracing.
   Investigations are still in progress to achieve a complete geotechnical
   and hydraulic characterization of soils. Furthermore, it is also
   expected to extend the analyses performed to the whole area affected by
   shallow landslides. However, we believe the results of this study can be
   helpful in shallow landslide modelling, hazard assessment and planning
   of appropriate risk mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Between 10th and 11th November, 2014, heavy rainfall over a short period
   fell on the eastern Genoa metropolitan area. The geohydrological event
   had important ground effects, among them the simultaneous flooding of
   Entella and Rupinaro streams, in Chiavari city. In lower Lavagna valley,
   the main tributary of the Entella, a landslide caused two casualties,
   while serious damage to buildings and infrastructures were registered in
   Chiavari's Old Town and in the nearby communities of Carasco and
   Cogorno. In the Entella basin, the rainfall peaked at 60 mm/hour and
   accumulated 220 mm in six hours. The levels of the streams rose
   instantly, showing concentration times of less than an hour. The Entella
   rose seven meters, flooding Carasco, Cogorno, and the Caperana
   neighborhood of Chiavari. Flash flooding of the Rupinaro stream caused
   water to rise to 1.5 m in Chiavari's historic core. Analyses were
   carried out of the weather conditions and the ground effects of the
   events; in addition, studies were made of the main causes of the
   geo-hydrological risk. In particular, variations in climate and
   uncontrolled urban development were the cause of increased
   geo-hydrological hazards and vulnerability of this area, historically
   subject to flooding. Such conditions of risk are unacceptable, and
   urgent measures are required to mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Madeira, like many mountainous volcanic islands, is susceptible to flash
   floods. Throughout its history, about 40 large events resulted in more
   than 1200 victims and countless damages. Recently, urban areas expanded
   greatly, leading to a higher exposure of the population to flash floods.
   In order to analyse ways to reduce vulnerability and decrease hazard in
   the urbanised, flash flood prone watershed of the Machico River, the
   construction of detention basins (DB) is simulated. A hydrological and
   hydraulic model was performed to determine if they would be a viable
   option to protect downstream populations. Modelling suggests that two 12
   m high outlet structures, and a storage capacity of 111 298 m(3) (DB1)
   and 121 095 m(3) (DB2), would reduce peak discharge by 72\%, from a
   precipitation event with a return period of 100 years. Two identified
   sensitive Sections (S) had their fill rates reduced from 130.6\% to
   79.6\% (S1) and from 128.6\% to 33.4\% (S2), thus preventing channel
   overflow. A concise economic analysis was made in terms of
   implementation and maintenance costs, as well as a SWOT analysis
   highlighting that DB should be regarded as a viable engineering solution
   to reduce vulnerability to flash floods hazards in volcanic islands with
   small, steep, and urbanised watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{JUNE 2013 Uttarakhand flash-flood killed nearly 5700 people and trapped
   110,000. The disaster caused a black-out, leading to a serious network
   failure which delayed rescue work in isolated areas. The lack of robust
   communication network has become a sizable topic for scrutiny of
   disaster inflicted area network system. Thus, it is important to design
   a network which never fails during such crisis. In this paper, a
   detailed survey of AONs (Always-On Network) is done and issues in
   implementation of those are highlighted. The architecture of existing
   networks has several practical issues in case of emergency which need to

Abstract = {{Here we analyse geomorphic, pedologic and hydrologic processes of
   relevance to archaeological research on the pre-colonial irrigation
   system at Engaruka, Tanzania. Although archaeological studies have been
   carried out in Engaruka for several decades; geophysical processes have
   not been in focus, despite having the potential to contribute to the
   understanding of both the ancient irrigation system and the current land
   use in Engaruka. Geomorphology and pedology were explored through field
   surveys and mapping using air photos and satellite images. The effects
   of the flash-flood during the 1997-1998 El Nino were mapped and
   quantified in the field. Maximum flash-flood discharge in Engaruka River
   was estimated using Marming's Equation. The geomorphic study revealed
   that Engaruka is an environment where high-magnitude processes (debris
   flows, flash-floods, rock slides) dominate landform development.
   Low-magnitude processes (sheet-wash, wind erosion), transfer
   fine-textured sediment to low terrain, causing successive coarsening of
   soil texture in fields of the ancient irrigation system. Andisol
   occurrence in the dry environment is associated with current irrigation,
   indicating incremental improvement of arable land resulting from human
   land use. Andisols appear transient; discontinuation of irrigation has
   caused a reversion to Entisols, as water retention and structure
   deteriorate upon drying. A flash-flood during the 1997-1998 El Nino
   caused destruction of parts of the archaeological remains, with severe
   impact on current land use and settlements. Approximately 80 ha (4\%) of
   the total area of the ancient remains were covered by debris flow
   deposits and alluvium, or scoured by new drainage lines of the water
   courses. The denudation caused by the single flash-flood is estimated to
   9 mm in the catchment of Engaruka River. Manning's Equation yielded a
   least possible maximum discharge in Engaruka River, in the order of 270
   m(3)/s, some 600-700 times higher than normal, dry season discharge.}},

Abstract = {{An extremely destructive category 5 cyclone (Saffir-Simpson), Tropical
   Cyclone Pam, struck Vanuatu on the evening of 13 March 2015, causing
   serious damage to infrastructure across the capital Port-Vila. We
   studied the coastal change, flash flood and damages effects three months
   after super cyclone. A flash flood affected one slumurb in Port-Vila. We
   studied the main features of the flood and also the vulnerability of the
   residents. The tropical cyclone produced storm surges and extensive
   inundation on severals parts of the coasts. The maximum wave heights
   reached five meters. Washover deposits and testimonies were used to map
   the flooding. Coastal changes (washover and erosion shape) indicated the
   coastal morpho-sedimentary responses to extreme event. Whereas cyclone
   advice to work very well (only eleven victims), the coastal risks and
   flood seem to be unknown or underestimated despite a very high exposure
   and vulnerability to risk.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of social and economic change on the consequences of
   natural hazards has been a matter of much interest recently. However,
   there is a lack of comprehensive, high-resolution data on historical
   changes in land use, population, or assets available to study this
   topic. Here, we present the Historical Analysis of Natural Hazards in
   Europe (HANZE) database, which contains two parts: (1) HANZE-Exposure
   with maps for 37 countries and territories from 1870 to 2020 in 100m
   resolution and (2) HANZE-Events, a compilation of past disasters with
   information on dates, locations, and losses, currently limited to floods
   only. The database was constructed using high-resolution maps of present
   land use and population, a large compilation of historical statistics,
   and relatively simple disaggregation techniques and rule-based land use
   reallocation schemes. Data encompassed in HANZE allow one to
   ``normalize{''} information on losses due to natural hazards by taking
   into account inflation as well as changes in population, production, and
   wealth. This database of past events currently contains 1564 records
   (1870-2016) of flash, river, coastal, and compound floods. The HANZE
   database is freely available at
   https://data.4tu.nl/repository/collection:HANZE.}},

Abstract = {{The 2015 Gorkha earthquake caused severe damage to structures in central
   Nepal. In 2017, a flash flood event occurred in the same area affected
   by the Gorkha earthquake and aggravated the damage to structures and
   lifelines. The present paper reports the damage of structures and
   lifelines subjected to multi-hazards in the affected area in central
   Nepal. Field investigations were performed after the Gorkha earthquake
   as well as the 2017 Chhatiune Khola flash flood. Specifically, damage
   associated with bridges, vernacular stone masonry buildings, roads,
   water supply systems, irrigation canals, electric poles, and road signs
   was assessed. Field measurement in terms of flow height was recorded in
   the case of vernacular buildings, and depth-damage curve due to the
   flash flood is depicted in this study. We have outlined the
   multi-hazards vulnerability of vernacular stone masonry buildings along
   the river banks susceptible to flash floods in this study. Moreover, a
   quantified damage scenario due to a strong earthquake and a flash flood
   is highlighted using field records.}},

Title = {{Vulnerability of HIV/AIDS orphans to floods in Malawi}},
Journal = {{GEOFORUM}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{151-158}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Referred to as the `forgotten causalities' of climate change (Cutter
   1995), very few studies have examined the precise nature and magnitude
   of climate change impacts on children, let alone on the growing number
   of orphans and vulnerable children in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), where
   climate change is already expected to exact its worst humanitarian toll.
   This paper examines personal, familial, and contextual circumstances
   that arise when children lose their parents to HIV/AIDS and how these
   situations mediate exposure to the impacts of climate related disasters.
   Using the case of flash floods that occurred in Malawi in 2015, and
   drawing on perspectives from political ecology and social vulnerability
   theory, the findings of a qualitative study (n = 51) suggest that
   orphans' vulnerability to floods was mediated by a number of specific
   circumstances. These include pre-existing physical health status of
   surviving parent or guardian, domestic roles they inherited following
   incapacitation or death of a parent, and social norms governing property
   inheritance within the traditional extended family system. In addition,
   the findings also show that the floods shattered livelihoods, forcing
   orphans into prolonged engagement in exploitative labour pursuits.
   Furthermore, the findings show that the rainstorm also swept away
   mementos left behind by parents, with profound effect on orphans'
   emotional wellbeing, which affected their interpretation of the meaning
   of the disaster. The study underscores (i) the potential of climate
   change to re-configure social relations and entrench orphans'
   subordinate status (ii) the historical specificity of the factors that
   mediate the effects of climate change on children.}},

Abstract = {{The identification and classification of critical coastal areas is
   becoming more and more important from a coastal management point of
   view, especially considering future climate change. The standardized
   assessment of multiple hazards and their potential impacts is crucial,
   in terms of risk management, for those coastal areas where both marine
   and fluvial hazards can occur.
   Nevertheless, in Bocca di Magra (Liguria Region, Italy), where both
   coastal and fluvial flooding can occur, up until now the potential
   impacts from marine flooding have not been thought to be of importance;
   only the impact of fluvial flooding has been systematically analysed.
   Now, however, the Liguria Regional stakeholders have become interested
   in understanding the potential impact of marine inundations compared to
   fluvial inundations, applying the CRAF (Coastal Risk Assessment
   Framework) methodology developed inside the RISC-KIT project.
   The hazard modelling of coastal and fluvial inundations was used,
   together with exposure data, to evaluate the direct and systemic impacts
   generated by both flooding mechanisms separately. An End-User-driven
   Multi Criteria Analysis was implemented to compare coastal and fluvial
   impacts on the same area.
   For an event with a 1 in 200 year return period, the CRAF predicts that
   fluvial inundation generates higher impacts, in comparison to the marine
   one. Even though the impacts in the coastal area are less, the impacted
   exposed elements are different from those impacted by fluvial inundation
   and none of them can be excluded from the analysis.
   This work highlights the need for regional managers to develop combined
   coastal-fluvial flooding assessments; such actions should be seen as a
   priority for flood disaster risk management in locations affected by
   both marine flooding and riverine flash flooding.}},

Abstract = {{Even though flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards in
   the Mediterranean, causing hundreds of deaths and economic losses and
   despite the significant efforts of civil protection authorities of all
   levels to protect human lives and assets, a critical piece of
   information, that is how the general population perceives flood risk, is
   not well known, especially in the Eastern part of the region. This work
   uses structured questionnaires to obtain basic information on how the
   population of one of the largest urban areas in Greece and the Eastern
   Mediterranean understands flood risk, risk mitigation and to what degree
   they take protection measures, they trust relevant institutions and they
   are aware of flood warning and flood protection actions. Then, the study
   examines potential correlations of the findings with respondents'
   demographics.
   Results show that respondents rank floods third in terms of importance
   behind earthquakes and forest fires that are important risk in the
   region, although the vast majority believes the risk is increasing,
   mostly due to anthropogenic factors. Responses illustrate low levels of
   trust in authorities and low levels of knowledge of protection actions
   and awareness regarding floods, as well as low levels of preparedness,
   in terms of taking private mitigation measures. Respondents'
   characteristics such as age, gender, previous flood experience and
   marital status are show statistical correlation with responses, as
   individuals present different perception and levels of knowledge and
   preparedness. Overall, the findings illustrate the need for better
   education and awareness campaigns regarding flood risk and mitigation
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{The recent trend of shifting focus from hazard centric drivers of
   vulnerability towards the social and economic drivers of vulnerability
   has led to a number of conceptual frameworks for social vulnerability
   assessment. Contributing towards this growing trend of social
   vulnerability assessment, this study proposes a framework to measure
   inherent vulnerability, which is centered on hazard generic and
   livelihood oriented socioeconomic factors of vulnerability. Inherent
   vulnerability is defined as the predisposition of a household to suffer
   harm. The study focuses on the mountainous communities in Kimsar region,
   located in Uttarakhand state, India. The communities in the region
   suffer from multiple stressors including extreme precipitation, drought,
   landslides, cloudbursts and flash floods. Vulnerability indicators with
   mixed scaling are used, to capture household's perception and other
   socio-economic attributes, which contribute towards its inherent
   vulnerability. Data was collected by conducting household surveys in
   nine villages of Kimsar region. In order to process the indicators with
   mixed scaling, and obtain an empirical summary of the data set, the
   method of Non-Linear Principal Component Analysis was used for computing
   a household level Inherent Vulnerability Index. Results obtained
   revealed that principal components explaining a major variance in the
   data set were access to employment opportunities, effectiveness of local
   government, access to food, occupational diversity, access to resources,
   educational attainment and access to water. It was observed that the
   villages of Dharkot, Kandakhal and Bhumiyakisar have the highest
   percentage of households, which were relatively less vulnerable to
   environmental stressors. Higher vulnerability was observed in majority
   of households in the village Kimsar, Ramjeewala and Malls Banas. A
   majority of households in Talla Banas, Jogiyana and Kasan were
   moderately vulnerable. Inherent vulnerability assessment has the
   potential to predict the future harm a household might suffer due to
   hazard events.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of Permeable Paving Systems (PPS) in minimizing surface
   water run-off which in turn reduces the imposed pressure on stormwater
   collection systems at the time of flash flooding have been recently
   remarked profoundly. In addition, the PPS have additional advantages
   such as filtering the pollutants for downstream water collection systems
   and accommodating transformation of nutrients and water to the
   surrounding vegetation. Inclusion of end-of-life tire products in the
   mixture of PPS can adjust the flexibility of the final product. Tire
   aggregates will potentially enhance the final product performance in
   areas where the ground movement or intrusion of roots can cause damage
   to conventional rigid pavement systems. The effect of addition of waste
   tire and rubber aggregates to solid granular material have been
   investigated in the past; however, their focus have been mainly on
   creating highly compacted mixtures. In contrast; in this study; mixtures
   of soft (end-of-life tire aggregates) and rigid aggregates (crushed
   rock) with a relatively high porosity was tested to evaluate their
   suitability for construction of permeable pavements which require high
   porosity. The flexibility of mixtures and their stress dependant
   behaviour was investigated based on the volumetric fraction of soft
   aggregates in the blend. The transitional soft-rigid behaviour of the
   mixture can be utilized to mitigate the unexpected deformation induced
   on the pavement. The compressive behaviour of highly permeable mixtures
   under k(o) loading and deviatoric shear provides an insight on the
   formation of force chains in the mixtures between the rigid particles.
   In addition, monitoring the compressive behaviour of rigid-soft
   aggregates under k(o) loading explains soft aggregates cushioning impact
   on improving the compressibility and shear behaviour of the mixture. (C)

Abstract = {{Flood vulnerability assessment is becoming increasingly important around
   the world. Nevertheless, the high dimensional and non-linear
   relationship between various indices and flood vulnerability greatly
   hinders researchers from making a reasonable assessment. Thus, an
   integrated flood vulnerability assessment approach is proposed here by
   combining a multi-criteria decision making technique, the technique for
   order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), with the
   Shannon entropy method. The Shannon entropy method is used to account
   for the inhomogeneity in the indicator values. TOPSIS uses a
   multi-criteria system where hydrodynamic modeling is applied to obtain
   the values of exposure indicators. This approach is tested in a rural
   district of Hainan Province, China. The flood vulnerability at the town
   and administrative village scales is presented through a geographic
   information system. By considering the inhomogeneity of the internal
   attributes, the integrated assessment approach is eventually proven as a
   highly realistic approach for assessing flood vulnerability. The
   advantages of this approach become highly pronounced when the evaluation
   objects have more internal indicators and the internal inhomogeneity
   among the values of these indicators is high. The main driving factors
   of flood vulnerability in one district has also been successfully
   identified using the proposed integrated method. In sum, this integrated
   assessment method can provide decision makers with highly targeted
   decision making references to effectively reduce the flood vulnerability
   of the study area.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change projections foresee an increasing number of intense
   precipitation events with consequent flash and riverine floods. An
   accurate and rapid mapping of these phenomena is a key component of
   effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans. Earth
   Observation big data such as the ones acquired by the Copernicus
   programme, are providing unprecedented opportunities to detect changes
   and assess economic impacts in case of disasters.
   This paper presents an innovative flood mapping technique based on an
   index which is computed using multi temporal statistics of Synthetic
   Aperture Radar images. The index compares a large amount of reference
   scenes to those acquired during the investigated flood and allows an
   easy categorization of ``flooded{''} areas; either areas solely
   temporarily covered by water or areas with mixed water and vegetation.
   The method has been developed specifically to exploit Sentinel-1 data
   but can be applied to any other sensor. It has been tested for the 2010
   flood of Veneto (Italy) and the floods of 2015 in Malawi and Uganda.
   Extensive qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with other
   state-of-the art methods, proved the proposed approach highly reliable
   and particularly effective, allowing a precise, simple and fast flood
   mapping. Compared to the maps produced for emergency management for the
   event analyzed, we obtained an overall agreement of 96.7\% for Malawi
   and an average of 96.5\% for Veneto for the 5 maps presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we present a method for identifying sources of water
   pollution and their relative contributions in pollution disasters. The
   method uses a combination of principal component analysis and factor
   analysis. We carried out a case study in three rural villages close to
   Beijing after torrential rain on July 21, 2012. Nine water samples were
   analyzed for eight parameters, namely turbidity, total hardness, total
   dissolved solids, sulfates, chlorides, nitrates, total bacterial count,
   and total coliform groups. All of the samples showed different degrees
   of pollution, and most were unsuitable for drinking water as
   concentrations of various parameters exceeded recommended thresholds.
   Principal component analysis and factor analysis showed that two
   factors, the degree of mineralization and agricultural runoff, and flood
   entrainment, explained 82.50\% of the total variance. The case study
   demonstrates that this method is useful for evaluating and interpreting
   large, complex water-quality data sets.}},

Abstract = {{The National Flash Flood Prevention Project, which mainly consists of
   non-structural and supplementary structural measures, has been conducted
   for 6 years in China. Some preliminary achievements have contributed to
   the prevention of flash flood in China. Based on the latest information,
   this article introduces China's flash flood prevention system, primarily
   from the perspective of its development process, components, investment,
   and characteristics. To date, the system has incorporated many
   distinguished large-scale features such as the largest rain gauge
   network (approximately 0.5 million stations) in the world, massive
   disaster observation and preparedness networks, people-and-expert
   combined monitoring and forecasting data integration system, and a vast
   implementation area. Based on its early achievements and some typical
   case investigations of such flash flood prevention system, the article
   also discusses China's prospects for preventing flash flood disasters in
   the future.}},

Abstract = {{The vulnerability of cities and communities in the Amazon to flooding
   and flash flooding is increasing. The effects of extreme events on
   populations vary across landscapes, causing vulnerability to differ
   spatially. Traditional vulnerability studies in Brazil and across the
   world have used the vulnerability index for the country and, more
   recently, municipality scales. The vulnerability dimensions are
   exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. For each of these
   dimensions, there is a group of indicators that constitutes a
   vulnerability index using quantitative data. Several vulnerability
   assessments have used sensitivity and exposure analyses and, recently,
   adaptive capacity has been considered. The Geographical Information
   Systems (GIS) analysis allows spatial regional modeling using
   quantitative vulnerability indicators. This paper presents a local-scale
   vulnerability assessment in an urban Amazonian area, Santarem City,
   using interdisciplinary methods. Data for exposure and sensitivity were
   gathered by remote sensing and census data, respectively. However,
   adaptive capacity refers to local capacities, whether infrastructural or
   not, and the latter were gathered by qualitative participatory methods.
   For the mixed data used to study adaptive capacity, we consider tangible
   components for countable infrastructure that can cope with hazards, and
   intangible components that reflect social activities based on risk
   perceptions and collective action. The results indicate that over 80\%
   of the area is highly or moderately vulnerable to flooding and flash
   flooding. Exposure and adaptive capacity were determinants of the
   results. Lower values of adaptive capacity play a significant role in
   vulnerability enhancement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Impact of flash flood recharge on groundwater quality and its
   suitability in the Wadi Baysh Basin, Western Saudi Arabia: an integrated
   approach}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{An integrated approach was used to evaluate the impact of flash flood
   recharge on groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking,
   irrigation, livestock and poultry uses in the Wadi Baysh Basin, Western
   Saudi Arabia. Analyses of 182 groundwater samples, collected from the
   study area before and after a flash flood (FF) event, show that the
   average concentrations of TDS, Mg, Na, Cl, NO3 and EC decreased
   significantly after the event. The major water types (mixed CaMgCl, NaCl
   and CaCl) indicate that the infiltration of surface water from FF
   recharge has a great influence on groundwater chemistry. Drinking water
   suitability maps, created using WHO standards, indicate that wells
   located in the upstream region are suitable for drinking despite their
   high TDS and total hardness (TH) values. Groundwater in the coastal
   region is unsuitable due to its high salinity, high TH and high
   concentrations of major ions. The suitability of groundwater for
   irrigational use was assessed using salinity, sodium adsorption ratio,
   bicarbonate hazard, residual sodium carbonate, Kelly's ratio, magnesium
   hazard, sodium percentage and permeability index values, which indicated
   that groundwater in the study region is suitable for most soils and
   crops. After FF, groundwater quality is improved by dilution, especially
   in the downstream region. USSL classification shows that the majority of
   the water samples are in the C3S1, C4S2, and C3S2 classes and are
   therefore suitable for the irrigation of salt-tolerant crops.
   Irrigational suitability maps suggest that wells in the upstream region
   are suitable for irrigation, whereas wells located near to the coast are
   unfit for irrigation. This study implies that construction of check dams
   in the dry valleys (wadies) may improve the groundwater quality in the
   area.}},

Abstract = {{For the past few decades, rapid urban development and climate change has
   caused many meteorological disasters (flooding, droughts, and heat
   waves) in South Korea. The current stormwater management system (gray
   infrastructure) is based on the pipe networks, which is not an effective
   method to control flash flooding problems during big rain events.
   Therefore, there is a need to find a more sustainable
   stormwater-management system that can have the ability to solve these
   water-related problems in urban areas. Low-impact development
   (LID)/green infrastructure (GI) practices are an effective approach to
   solving the adverse effects of urbanization and to addressing climate
   change. This paper reviews national water-management policies which were
   selected for flood and environmental protection from 1960 to 2017.
   Research results of applied LID practices in Korea also show that these
   practices are useful for stormwater management in urban areas. The
   dominating challenges identified are: lack of proper knowledge for
   implementing LID practices; uncertainties in the benefits of LID/GI
   practices; and lack of cooperation and collaboration between different
   agencies for the expansion of LID projects. Finally, some opportunities
   for LID/GI practices in Korea are also described.}},

Abstract = {{Texas ranks first in the U.S in number of fatalities due to natural
   disasters. Based on data culled from the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 1959 to 2016, the number of
   hydrometeorological fatalities in Texas have increased over the 58-year
   study period, but the per capita fatalities have significantly
   decreased. Spatial review found that non-coastal flooding is the
   predominant hydrometeorological disaster in a majority of the Texas
   counties located in Flash Flood Alley and accounts for 43\% of all
   hydrometeorological fatalities in the state. Flooding fatalities occur
   most frequently on Transportation Routes followed by heat fatalities in
   Permanent Residences. Seasonal and monthly stratification identifies
   Spring and Summer as the deadliest seasons, with the month of May
   registering the highest number of total fatalities dominated by flooding
   and tornado fatalities. Demographic trends of hydrometeorological
   disaster fatalities indicated that approximately twice as many male
   fatalities occurred from 1959-2016 than female fatalities, but with
   decreasing gender disparity over time. Adults are the highest fatality
   risk group overall, children are most at risk to die in flooding, and
   the elderly at greatest risk of heat-related death.}},

Abstract = {{The Petra Archaeological Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985,
   characterized by a spectacular geo-archaeological landscape, is also a
   fragile site facing a wide diversity of natural phenomena (landslides,
   flash floods, earthquakes) that pose a major threat to the heritage as
   well as to the visitors. The UNESCO Office in Amman, in partnership with
   the Department of Antiquities of Jordan and the Petra Archaeological
   Park has engaged in a long term strategy aimed at the prevention and
   mitigation of natural hazards at the site. Specific attention has been
   devoted to the case of the Petra Siq, a 1.2 km naturally formed gorge in
   the sandstone mountains serving as the only tourist entrance to the
   site, which is particularly at risk due to its narrow pathway, limited
   access points and recent active slope processes. Drawing on this
   approach, the UNESCO ``Siq Stability{''} project has been developed to
   design a strategy towards prevention and mitigation of instability
   phenomena at the Siq of Petra. After an initial phase devoted to the
   reconstruction of geomorphological dynamics and monitoring of active
   slope processes, the current phase of the project focuses on the
   implementation of landslide risk mitigation measures, the capacity
   development of the national authorities and the development and
   implementation of an awareness strategy on natural hazards. Main focus
   has been placed on project activities undertaken, results achieved and
   suggestions for steps ahead, aiming to present a useful case study on
   the management of natural hazards applied to heritage sites leading to
   the conservation of a unique World Heritage property.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Flooding causes huge economic losses, yet the flood water is an
   important resource, especially in arid and semiarid areas. Because
   rivers flood annually, most flooding research has focused on river
   management. Researchers have largely ignored the resource potential of
   flash floods, as they are less predictable. Here, we describe an
   innovative project in which disaster management planners in a dryland
   community in northwestern China treated flash floods as a resource
   rather than as a threat, and helped the community to benefit from this
   resource. The project produced ecological benefits (combating
   desertification), social benefits (flood control), and economic benefits
   (harvesting water for future use) that improved the community's adaptive
   capacity and facilitated sustainable development. This example should
   inspire risk managers to seek ways to transform natural disasters into
   resources, thereby improving hazard management and promoting community
   survival and development.}},

Abstract = {{Floods devastate communities and result in large economic losses in the
   lower reaches of the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand. The aim of this
   study was to determine whether nonstructural flood countermeasures would
   help prevent flash floods in the upstream area of the Upper Chao Phraya
   River Basin, and control the volume of floodwaters reaching the
   downstream area.
   Numerical models were used to quantify the effects of nonstructural
   measures, namely land use regulation, reforestation, and retention
   areas, and to examine how efficient these proposed nonstructural
   approaches would have been during the severe flood events that occurred
   in 1995, 2006 and 2011. Three scenarios, reforestation, retention areas,
   and the combination of reforestation and retention areas, were developed
   for these nonstructural flood countermeasures, as outlined in the Thai
   Master Plan for Water Resources Management.
   Their effectiveness in the Upper Chao Phraya River Basin was
   quantitatively assessed by comparing the model results for the actual
   conditions with the scenario results. Results showed that the proposed
   nonstructural measures had considerable potential to reduce peak
   discharges and flood volumes in the Upper Chao Phraya River Basin.
   Integration of these proposed nonstructural flood countermeasures with
   the existing countermeasures in the Chao Phraya River Basin may be the
   most practical way to cope with the challenges of future flood
   disasters. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods cause damages and need emergency actions especially in
   urban areas. Flood forecasting and flood warning systems (FFFWSs) can be
   used for reducing flood damages and saving lives in areas vulnerable to
   flooding. However, researches are needed to evaluate the effect of
   urbanisation and the significance of implementing catchment-management
   plan (ICMP) on FFFWS. This paper describes a framework proposed to
   assess the impact of ICMP on expected lead time (ELT) of flash-flood
   warning and it was applied for an urbanised steep catchment in an arid
   region, north of metropolitan city, Tehran, Iran. The model is well
   calibrated and validated before and after ICMP by four observed floods.
   The results show that ICMP reduces mainly flood risk only in low-return
   periods (about 30\%) than in high-return periods. Finally, this paper
   demonstrated the efficiency of ICMP in increasing emergency time for
   evacuation from possible inundated areas except in extreme floods
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods induced by heavy rainfall occur frequently in China, which
   cause severe damages or even casualties every year. Flash floods
   generally occur in small catchments, and therefore were poorly
   documented. A Database including 963 flash flood events in China is
   compiled and studied in this study. Analytical results (a) indicate
   flash flood condition in China; (b) shed light on the spatial-temporal
   distribution of flash flood under heavy rainfall and (c) detect the
   characteristics of the 2016 flash flood. In 2016, the deaths due to
   flash floods were severe and concentrated, accounting for about half of
   the elderly and children. Hebei and Fujian provinces were most affected
   by flash floods. The disasters mainly occurred in July and the major
   types were river floods. Despite the frequent torrential rains,
   inadequate monitoring and early warning systems made the flash flooding
   condition even worse in 2016.}},

Abstract = {{Transportation networks as a critical infrastructure are at increasing
   risk of flooding and thus damaging disruption. The resulted disruption
   even in small flood events may impose indirect damages which needs to be
   quantified to better manage traffic flows. In this paper, a framework
   was developed to address the vulnerability of transportation networks to
   pluvial and coastal flooding based on a state-of-the-art
   depth-disruption function which estimates flood depth impact on
   vehicle's speed reduction. In this framework, the flood depth was
   modeled using a static and hydrodynamic model and then assigned to each
   road segment. By turning flood depth into factors causing increase in
   travel time, the service area of four emergency services were calculated
   and the effect of coastal and pluvial flooding on road networks were
   discussed. The Lower Manhattan in New York City was selected as a case
   study. Results show that this framework provides better insights into
   determining critical road segments and subsequently traffic management
   during flooding events.}},

Abstract = {{The coast is one of the areas most affected by natural hazards, with
   floods being the most frequent and significant of these in terms of
   their induced impacts, so any management scheme requires their
   evaluation. In coastal areas, flooding is a hazard associated with
   different processes acting at different scales: coastal storms, flash
   floods and sea level rise (SLR). To address the problem as a whole, this
   study presents a methodology to undertake a preliminary integrated risk
   assessment of the magnitude of each flood component, taking into account
   their scope (extension of the affected area) and their temporal scale.
   The risk is quantified using specific indicators to assess the hazard
   magnitude (for each component) and the consequences. This allows for a
   robust comparison of the spatial risk distribution along the coast in
   order to identify both the most at-risk areas and the most influential
   risk components. This methodology is applied to a stretch of coastline
   (Maresme, Catalonia) representative of the Spanish Mediterranean coast.
   The results obtained characterise this coastline as an area with a
   relatively low overall risk, although some hotspots are identified as
   having high-risk values.}},

Abstract = {{Typhoon is one of the disastrous weather systems that usually occur in

   of typhoon gale and the risk-based warning of typhoon rainstorm. By
   calculating the accumulated wind pressure and the designed wind load of
   bearing walls of low-rise building in coastal region, we define the
   damaged building index. In addition, four steps for the risk-based
   warning or impact forecasting for small and medium-sized river basins,
   flash flood, mud flows and landslides caused by Typhoon rainstorm are
   introduced, which include understanding vulnerability of disaster

Journal = {{JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{The shift from flood protection to flood risk management, together with
   recent arguments on incorporating culture in managing risk, underscores
   the application of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in managing
   disasters from flood hazards. Yet, documentation and incorporation of
   TEK into practice remains a challenge. This article contributes to
   addressing this challenge by exploring the existence of TEK to flooding
   in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda. Using semi-structured interviews,
   data were collected from residents of the Nyamwamba watershed where
   intense flash floods caused deadly impacts in May 2013. Collected data
   were analysed using content, thematic and interpretive analysis
   techniques. Results indicate that TEK is exhibited through various
   traditional ecological approaches (TEAs). Although endangered, TEAs
   (conducted through collective action for a communally accepted end) are
   framed in three main activities: (1) assessment and prediction of
   rainfall and flood by the traditional hydro-meteorologist (diviner) and
   the traditional rain forecaster (rainmaker); (2) the mountain cleansing
   ritual (which act as flood risk awareness platform); and (3) immunising
   riverine communities through planting certain indigenous plants, which
   improve hydrological systems through their high conservation value for
   native ecological diversity. As most TEAs are conducted through
   collective action, they represent a platform to understand local
   capacities and enhance adoption of measures, and/or a source of
   knowledge for new measures to address flood risk. Therefore, full-scale
   investigations of these TEAs, determining how relevant TEAs are
   fine-tuned, and (scientific) measures enculturated based on fine-tuned
   TEAs could result in effective flood risk management in various flood
   hotspots where TEAs influence action.}},

Abstract = {{On the morning of 18 September 2017, the center of the city of Elblag in
   northern Poland was inundated by the rapidly rising waters of the
   Kumiela River, resulting in considerable damage and chaos in the city.
   The present paper provides information about this event, which was
   caused by intense precipitation lasting two days. We put this individual
   event in perspective by examining the climate track in the observation
   and projection of flood hazard through analyzing changes in temperature,
   precipitation and intense precipitation. We also examine the
   non-climatic factors of flood risk, such as spatial development and
   river regulation. Further, we pose the question of whether actions aimed
   at flood risk reduction, predominantly by way of structural defenses in
   the catchment of the Kumiela River, really reduce the flood risk in
   Elblag. We also offer more general remarks pertaining to flood risk
   reduction in Poland, primarily based on technical measures, and we
   unveil the shortcomings of the current flood risk management system in
   Poland. In the social consciousness, the structural flood defense
   strategy has become the norm of thinking in terms of methods for
   reducing the effects of floods in Poland, but this does not always
   contribute to reducing flood damage either locally or nationally. We
   refer to some good examples of preparedness for urban inundations caused
   by heavy precipitation in other cities.}},

Abstract = {{Early arrival of monsoon, its collision with westerlies, ensuing
   abnormally high precipitation resulting in fast melting of fresh snow
   accompanied by breach of a glacial lake, Chorabari Tal; stage was thus
   set for a major hydrometeorological disaster in Uttarakhand in June
   2013. With no specific warning, a disaster of this magnitude was not
   anticipated, and everyone was taken by surprise. The incidence also
   coincided with the peak of the tourist season when pilgrims, tourists,
   and others from across the country and abroad had gathered in the region
   in large numbers. The incidence thus resulted in a major tragedy of
   recent times in which human death toll surpassed 4000. The disaster was
   a major setback for the economy of the state to which tourism and
   pilgrimage are major contributors. Burden on public exchequer was
   further exacerbated by tax waiver and assistance provided to
   disaster-affected population even on losses that are not generally
   covered by State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Important lessons were
   however learned in managing this disaster, and these would go a long way
   in strengthening the disaster management system not only in Uttarakhand
   but also elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{On June 16 and 17, 2013, high-intensity rainfall (>400 mm) in different
   parts of the state of Uttarakhand caused devastating flash floods and
   triggered widespread landsides. In this event incurred heavy losses to
   the infrastructure, agricultural fields, human and animal lives, roads
   and widespread destruction of natural resources. Disaster of such a
   magnitude of disaster was perhaps not experienced by the region at least
   over the last 100 years. Thus, this disaster can be considered as an
   extreme climatic event of the century. The extent and intensity of the
   tragedy can easily be visualised by the fact that all the famous shrines
   of the Uttarakhand state are located in high mountainous, snowbound
   areas. These places, Badrinath (3133 m asl in Alaknanda valley),
   Kedarnath (3584 m asl in Mandakini valley), Gangotri (3140 m asl in
   Bhagirathi valley), Yamunotri (3291 m asl in Yamuna valley) and Hemkund
   Sahib (4433 m asl in Alaknanda valley), were badly affected by this
   extreme fury of the nature.
   In this paper we cover the devastated area that lies in the Bhagirathi
   river valley, which forms a part of Uttarkashi, Tehri and Pauri
   districts in the Lesser and Higher Himalayas, Garhwal. During the field
   observation, we have collected a total number of 4955 points in the
   Bhagirathi valley; these points are points of interest (POI) (2084),
   damage to bridges and culverts (44), landslides (1034), eroded land
   cover and natural resource (92), riverbank erosion (170), damage to
   roads (494), damage to other infrastructures (320) and damage to
   buildings (717). These collected points can be used for rehabilitation
   and infrastructure development, implication in future plan.}},

Abstract = {{The north-eastern part of Bangladesh is very productive for agriculture
   and fishing, and the region involves several depressed (haor) areas.
   Flash floods during the pre-monsoon period bring devastating damage to
   agriculture in the haor region recurrently. To protect crops from flash
   floods, the Bangladesh Water Development Board constructed several
   ringtype submersible embankments. In this research, we have investigated
   the effectiveness of submersible embankments in controlling flash
   flooding in the Matian and Shanir haors in the Sunamganj district. A
   two-dimensional rainfall runoff inundation model was applied considering
   several scenarios for simulating heavy flash flood events in 2004, 2010,
   and 2016. Without an embankment, the river overflow would have entered
   the Matian haor 3 days, 22 days, and 9 days earlier in 2004, 2010, and
   2016, respectively, whereas it would have been 7 days and 23 days
   earlier in 2004 and 2010 for the Shanir haor. The event in 2016 was
   successfully stopped by the Shanir haor embankment. To avoid river
   overflow entering into the Matian and Shanir haor completely, the
   embankment height must be elevated further by 1 m and 0.7 m,
   respectively. Providing proper drainage facilities for the accumulated
   rain water inside the hoar is still an important issue for protecting
   the crops effectively.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is affecting the frequency and severity of extreme
   meteorological and geo-hydrological events hitting the coastal zone of
   the Campi Flegrei volcanic district (southern Italy), which is prone to
   a wide spectrum of natural hazards, including volcanism, earthquakes,
   ground deformation, flash floods, landslides, and coastal erosion. This
   study documents the trend of flash floods affecting the town of
   Pozzuoli, located along the coastline of the Campi Flegrei volcanic
   area, during the 1970-2014 time period. An archive research together
   with the collection of data published on news websites and social media
   allowed understanding of the triggering and evolution mechanisms of
   flash floods in the area, as well as the most recurrent damages.
   Rainfall data collected by the rain gauge located within the Pozzuoli
   watershed were also analyzed. Results of this study show an increased
   frequency of flash flood events occurred in the study area. The
   variation in flash flood frequency is likely not related to urbanization
   changes, as no increase of the urban area occurred after the year 2000.
   The observed increase of flash flood events in recent years (2000-2014)
   can be reasonably ascribed to variations in the rainfall regime. Our
   research provides a contribution for the understanding of flash flood
   processes in the study area as well as relevant information for hazard
   and risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{This Australian study establishes a model that provides a foundation for
   communication channels and tools selection by agencies in the
   post-warning response phase of a disaster. The model, developed from
   disaster and information seeking literature, attempts to predict
   information source and channel selection by people after their community
   has received a warning for a disaster. It provides the coding framework
   for analysis of 51 semi structured interviews with disaster-affected
   Australians. The interviews tested the model for accommodation of
   channels and sources that people chose, found most useful, and used most
   in bushfire, slow flood, flash flood, and cyclone situations. The order
   of initial sources was investigated and preliminary information seeking
   pathways established across disaster types. The disaster information
   seeking model supports this investigation of information seeking
   behaviour, though improvements are suggested. The resulting model could
   guide agency response communication for different disaster types.}},

Title = {{Flood inundation assessment for the Hanoi Central Area, Vietnam under
   historical and extreme rainfall conditions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods have long been common in Asian cities, with recent
   increases in urbanization and extreme rainfall driving increasingly
   severe and frequent events. Floods in urban areas cause significant
   damage to infrastructure, communities and the environment. Numerical
   modelling of flood inundation offers detailed information necessary for
   managing flood risk in such contexts. This study presents a calibrated
   flood inundation model using referenced photos, an assessment of the
   influence of four extreme rainfall events on water depth and inundation
   area in the Hanoi central area. Four types of historical and extreme
   rainfall were input into the inundation model. The modeled results for a
   2008 flood event with 9 referenced stations resulted in an R-2 of 0.6
   compared to observations. The water depth at the different locations was
   simulated under the four extreme rainfall types. The flood inundation
   under the Probable Maximum Precipitation presents the highest risk in
   terms of water depth and inundation area. These results provide insights
   into managing flood risk, designing flood prevention measures, and
   appropriately locating pump stations.}},

Abstract = {{Flood mitigation involves the management and control of floodwater
   movement, such as redirecting flood runoff through the use of floodwalls
   and flood gates, rather than trying to prevent floods altogether. The
   prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on
   individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities. The
   current study area is located in Hurghada on the Red Sea, which is
   considered an important area for coastal tourism. The study area is
   located at distance 7.50 km from El Gouna city along the Red Sea and
   east of Hurghada-Al Ismaileya road. The aim of this research is to
   derive the runoff flow paths across the study area and their flow
   magnitudes under different rainfall events of 10, 25, 50, and 100 year
   return periods in order to design the flood mitigation measures to
   protect such important areas. Field data (e.g., topographic data and
   rainfall intensities) were collected for the study area. The results
   indicated that the site is exposed to high flash flood risk and
   protection work is required. In order to protect the area from flood
   risks, locations of number of drainage channels and dams were selected
   and designed based on flood quantity and direction. The proposed
   mitigation system is capable of protecting this crucial area from flood
   risks and increases the national income from tourism. This study can be
   applied in different areas of Egypt and the world.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain flood hazards are now among the most studied hazards, given
   that they cause loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure
   throughout the world. This paper takes the 2015 Xuyong flash
   flood/debris flow event as a case study to examine the impacts of human
   activities on the occurrence and amplification of mountain flood
   hazards. Field investigations, the interpretation of observational data
   and mechanistic analyses are carried out as part of a comprehensive
   analysis of the processes by which mountain flood hazards develop and
   become amplified, the contribution of excessive sediment supplies to
   mountain flood hazards and the effects of human activities on mountain
   flood hazards. Results of this comprehensive analysis indicate that some
   human activities contribute to the occurrence of the initiation of
   mountain flood hazards. These human activities fall into two main
   categories: (1) deforestation and improper construction damage the
   natural environment and may increase the occurrence of mountain flood
   hazards; (2) improper choices of residences, local congestion of
   engineering structures and some other factors may directly amplify the
   losses caused by mountain flood hazards. Finally, some hazard prevention
   and mitigation measures for mountain flood hazards are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{High-magnitude, low-frequency rain events (heavy rains) have increased
   on the island of Madeira in recent years. The levadas, a built heritage
   of water canals, and one of the biggest tourist attractions on the

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Characterization of flash flood severity in real-time has been
   highlighted by National Weather Service (NWS) service assessments for
   almost two decades. Current flash flood warning techniques provide
   limited guidance on determining potential severity of flood impacts.
   Recent software updates allowing for the estimation of rainfall average
   recurrence intervals (ARIs) in real-time help improve the nowcasting of
   flash flood events, but guidance is lacking on specific ARIs to use as
   thresholds. Researchers at the NWS Lower Mississippi River Forecast
   Center collected data for 24 flash flood events across the eastern
   United States. Reports of flash flooding were characterized based upon
   relative severity, and then matched to rainfall ARIs. Preliminary
   results from this study suggest that utilizing the 2-yr ARI contour
   derived from 3-h rainfall would capture approximately 90\% of flash
   flood reports. It also was found that more significant flash flood
   impacts generally became more common with an increased 3-h rainfall ARI,
   with major flooding of roadways or structures (>= 0.91 m, or 3 ft, of
   inundation) becoming likely by around a 25-yr max ARI for the storm.
   Because of biases in the available cases used in the analysis, results
   are considered preliminary and subject to considerable case-by-case
   variability.}},

Title = {{How Do Capital Asset Interactions Affect Livelihood Sensitivity to
   Climatic Stresses? Insights From the Northeastern Floodplains of
   Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{165-176}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper offers a novel methodological approach for better
   understanding how different capital assets can be organized,
   transformed, and used in different combinations to reduce livelihood
   sensitivity to climatic stresses - an area that requires greater
   research attention in the context of adaptation policy. Research was
   conducted in the northeastern floodplain communities of Bangladesh,
   regarded as one of the most climate sensitive, resource poor, and highly
   understudied areas of the country. This wetland-dominated ecosystem is
   home to diverse resources user groups (e.g., farmer and fisher) who are
   subjected to regular seasonal flooding, excessive rainfall, drought, and
   flash floods. Working in 12 adjacent villages of two significant
   wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), qualitative and quantitative
   data were collected through 15 focus groups (n = 15), 35 key informant
   interviews, and 356 household surveys to better understand how community
   members adapt in response to their livelihood sensitivity to the
   climatic stresses. Results indicate that community members organize and
   transform capital assets in diverse ways to escape climate-induced
   ``poverty traps{''}. Findings also reveal that interventions from
   external agencies (e.g., government, non-governmental organizations and
   market institutions) are an important key to livelihood sustainability
   for many households.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution explores the evolution of the flood risk in the
   Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (MAB; Northeast Spain) from 1981 to 2015,
   and how it has been affected by changes in land use, population and
   precipitation. To complete this study, we analysed PRESSGAMA and
   INUNGAMA databases to look for all the information related to the floods
   and flash floods that have affected the chosen region. The Consorcio de
   Compensacion de Seguros, a state insurance company for extraordinary
   risks, provided data on economic damage. The extreme precipitation trend
   was analysed by the Fabra Observatory and El Prat-Airport Observatory,
   and daily precipitation data were provided by the State Meteorological
   Agency of Spain (AEMET) and the Meteorological Service of Catalonia
   (SMC). Population data were obtained from the Statistical Institute of
   Catalonia (IDESCAT). Changes in land use were estimated from the land
   use maps for Catalonia corresponding to 1956, 1993, 2000, 2005 and 2009.
   Prevention measures like rainwater tanks and improvements to the
   drainage system were also been considered. The specific case of
   Barcelona is presented, a city recognised by United Nations
   International Strategy for Disaster Reduction as a model city for urban
   resilience to floods. The evolution of flood events in the MAB does not
   show any significant trend for this period. We argue that the evolution
   in floods can be explained, at least in part, by the lack of trend in
   extreme precipitation indices, and also by the improvements in flood
   prevention measures.}},

Abstract = {{Impacts of floods on human society have been drawing increasing human
   concerns in recent years. In this study, flood observations from EM-DAT
   (Emergency Events Database) and DFO (Dartmouth Flood Observatory)
   datasets were analyzed to investigate frequency and intensity of floods,
   and flood-induced mortality, flood-affected population as well during
   1975-2016 across the globe. Results indicated that: (1) occurrence rate
   of floods, flood-induced mortality and flood-affected population were
   generally increasing globally. However, flood-induced mortality and
   flood-affected people per flood event were in slight decrease,
   indicating that flood-induced mortality and flood-affected people due to
   increased floods exceeded those by individual flood event; (2) annual
   variation of mortality per flood event is highly related to floods with
   higher intensity. Specifically, the flood frequency and flood-induced
   mortality are the largest in Asia, specifically in China, India,
   Indonesia and Philippine; while significantly increased flood-affected
   population and mean annual mortality was detected in China, USA and
   Australia; (3) tropical cyclones (TC) are closely related to
   flood-induced mortality in parts of the countries along the western
   coast of the oceans. The frequency of channel floods in these regions is
   the largest and large proportion of flood-induced deaths and the highest
   flood-induced mortality can be attributed to TC-induced flash floods;
   (4) Population density and GDP per unit area are in significantly
   positive correlation with the number of flood-related victims per unit
   area, number of deaths and economic losses with exception of low-income
   countries. However, the flood-affected population and flood-induced
   mortality increase with decrease of per capita GDP; while the per capita
   economic loss increases with the increase of per capita GDP, indicating
   that the higher the population density and GDP per unit for a region,
   the higher sensitivity of this area to flood hazards. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An analysis was conducted of the activity of individual homogeneous
   Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) and their impact on the components of
   the spatially distributed water balance based on the example of two
   urbanised catchments of the city of Poznan (Western Poland). Water
   balance was developed using the WetSpass model and GIS spatial data,
   based on hydrometeorological data from the reference period of 1961-2000
   including projected land usage changes and precipitation changes
   expected by 2025 in the city. The catchments were parameterised with
   reference to land usage, soil permeability, terrain declivities and the
   level of groundwater waters in summer and winter. The dependence between
   HRUs and their impact on components of the water balance was determined.
   Water balance forecasts have shown two-way changes in the components of
   approximately 12\% of the catchments. A significant increase of surface
   runoff (an increase of 20-30 mm/HRU) at the expense of effective
   infiltration reduction (by 15-20 mm/HRU) was determined for arable land
   intended for development. An increase of infiltration and
   evapotranspiration at the expense of the surface runoff reduction is
   forecast for areas designed for urban afforestation. The tendency of
   increase of atmospheric precipitation within the city until 2025 was
   indicated by changes in the water balance components. Changes in the
   landscape resulting from urban expansion may lead to detrimental
   hydrological effects: accumulation of surface runoffs and occurrence of
   local flash flooding, as confirmed by the simulations carried out using
   the WetSpass model. The results may contribute to a more accurate
   understanding of the impact of urban landscape modification patterns on
   the water balance at the regional and local scale.}},

Abstract = {{Flood is a severe natural disaster which causes major damages in most
   regions including in Iran. Loss of human lives as a consequence of flash
   flood has not been sufficiently studied despite its high annual rate.
   Review of related literature indicates relatively low accuracy of
   available global relationships for estimating loss of life due to flash
   floods. As a result, regional equations dealing with loss of life
   estimation relying on all effective hydraulic and evacuation variables
   is a way forward. In this study, hydraulic variables, such as depth,
   velocity and rise rate, and evacuation parameters, including available
   time for evacuation and fraction of people evacuated, were adopted to
   develop a regional loss of life equation in residential areas of Kan
   watershed case study, Tehran, Iran, using a calibrated 2DHEC-RAS model.
   Different number of fatalities in downstream and upstream villages
   revealed the importance of evacuation time when an early flood warning
   system is operational. Comparison of the proposed regional equation with
   available global equations showed that the proposed equation provides
   more accurate estimation of the number of fatalities in the study area.
   Regarding the estimated mortality, a local sensitivity analysis
   performed on the developed equation showed the importance of flood depth
   to evacuation time ratio, water rising rate and flow velocity,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research is to improve the understanding and
   recognition of the management challenges to flash flooding hazards and
   the potential adaptive measures within the arid urban areas through a
   socio-hydrological framework. Considering the capital of Sudan,
   Khartoum, as an example of urban arid areas with increasing flash flood
   risk, the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected
   from a range of different flood management actors following the 2013 and
   2014 flash flood events. The qualitative research methods included
   participant observation, expert interviews and focus groups. The main
   themes of management challenges recorded included weak institutional
   capacity, bad governance, limited resources, and poor urban planning.
   These four themes, in turn, included different types of challenges,
   among which lack of: civil society engagement and coordination of
   actors, political will, data and tools, and effective urban development
   strategy shared the highest number of comments from the professional
   actors in each theme, respectively. These findings presented a
   management perspective to the lessons previously established and learned
   from an impact assessment. Accordingly, the amalgamation of all the
   lessons learned from the flood research findings enabled a suitable
   Master Flash Flood Management Plan (MaFFMaP) to be proposed as a final
   product. This plan would operate within an Integrated Flash Flood
   Management (IFFM) framework. The facets of the MaFFMaP include steps
   toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding
   this hazard, aspects for use of these new datasets within a
   mixed-measure (structural and non-structural) approach from the
   authorities, and programmes for building community and civil society
   capacity through improving awareness and engagement. Furthermore, it is
   intended that this plan would be a replicable design, which could
   therefore be adopted and implemented in the wider context of the urban
   arid regions.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall-induced disaster is long duration disasters that have a
   probability of power failure that makes disaster worst due to lack of
   communication. Flash Flood, long duration flood, and landslides are few
   examples of them. In this case, Communication between victims is a
   challenging job. This paper presents an idea to overcome these kinds of
   situations. Different tools have been developed Alert about disaster
   including in flood disaster but during the flood, power failure makes
   these impossible to work for a long duration while flood is long
   duration disaster. This paper introducing an Alert Network designed by
   different technologies including WSN, MANET, and IoT. This architecture
   will be able to communicate in absence of any fixed infrastructure as
   well as it will be able to communicate through the social media if
   available. For supporting the architecture, the use of the screen with a
   solar cell as well as OLED with a screen to enhance the battery life of
   a Smartphone is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are typical for the Mediterranean region, however they have
   been recurring at increasing frequency over the past few decades
   especially over the Italian Peninsula. The region of Genoa has recently
   moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous
   flash floods of the Bisagno River and its tributaries as a result of
   intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last
   flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011
   and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the
   increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall
   regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This
   study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects
   of the Bisagno River flash flood of October 9th, 2014 in the city of
   Genoa. Application of a Standard Anomaly Index and a Cluster Analysis
   reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded
   in the Bisagno Valley for the period of 1945-2016. Urban sprawl in the
   catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and
   photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total
   consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding
   Genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in
   rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to
   increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land
   use change, including in particular transformations of the Bisagno
   riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to
   mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen
   observatory for early warning of flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to investigate information seeking
   behaviour of people involved in slow and flash flood disasters,
   specifically how they received the first alert, where they then turned
   for more information, and what their main sources and forms were. An
   online and mailed survey based on models of problem-specific information
   seeking and risk information for natural hazards secured responses from
   Australians who had experienced flash flood (n=91) and slow flood
   (n=41). It found that information pathways taken by individuals are
   different for slow and flash floods, but the set of information forms
   and sources used are similar. `Other people', television and news and
   weather websites were predominant sources and forms in flash flood, and
   online sources, television and radio predominant in slow flood. The
   importance of other people and mainstream media (including their online
   sites) in information behaviour means that mainstream media should
   remain an important component of information efforts by agencies. This
   study builds further evidence that disaster type and the media landscape
   should be taken into account when developing warning and response
   communication strategies, and allows public information officers to
   prioritise communication forms during response.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, a number of catastrophic hydrometeorological hazards occurred
   in 2017 among which the monsoon floods in South Asia was particularly
   disastrous, killing nearly 1200 people in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
   The wetland region (Haor) of northeastern (NE) Bangladesh was severely
   affected by flash floods early in 2017, affecting nearly 1 million
   households and damaging US \$ 450 million worth of rice crops. This
   study investigates how the NE Bangladesh experienced the 2017 flash
   floods, and to what degree the wetland communities are vulnerable and
   resilience to flash floods. Focus group discussion, key informant
   interviews, and household questionnaire surveys (n=80) were applied in
   the study area of Sunamganj district. Results from statistical analyses
   and regression modelling reveal that poor people are particularly
   vulnerable to floods but they are also more adaptive and thus resilient;
   middle-income households are vulnerable as they are hesitant to take up
   any jobs and accept flood relief; and rich households, despite being
   less adaptive, are able to recover from flood disasters because of
   wealth. This study reveals that resilience also stems from deep
   religious faith in the Haor inhabitants that supports communities to
   move on by accepting that most natural calamities such as flash floods
   are divine tests. This study also finds that women are particularly
   vulnerable and less resilient as they are not normally allowed to work
   outside of their homes and beyond the Haor communities due to cultural
   and religious reasons.}},

Abstract = {{Ladakh, a high altitude cold desert in India inhabited by various ethnic
   communities, has become quite vulnerable to environmental hazards like
   flash-floods, cloudbursts, snowstorms, landslides etc. This landscape
   which has been traditionally dominated by Buddhist and Muslim
   communities, has witnessed much devastation in the 2010, 2012 and 2015
   flash-floods and cloudbursts which resulted in a big loss of human lives
   besides massive infrastructural damages.
   The present paper seeks to study the impact of religion, culture,
   customs and rituals of this small Himalayan Ladakhi society in directly
   or indirectly influencing disaster response and recovery mechanisms. It
   would also explore the impact of behavior, perceptions and responses of
   Ladakhi communities in times of disasters. The paper seeks to understand
   not only the cultural framings in the times of disasters but also its
   socio-cultural settings, inter-community relations, government's role
   that can influence risk reduction, disaster's Impact on livelihood and
   cultural survival.}},

Abstract = {{Floods have prevailed in the recent years, hampering not only social but
   also the economic development as well. This global pandemic has caused
   loss of lives, property and economic damages in many countries,
   including Zimbabwe. Rainfall intensity in the country's seven main river
   catchments namely; Mzingwane, Gwayi, Save (or Sabi), Mazowe (or Mazoe),
   Sanyati, Manyame and Runde triggers flash floods due to high peak
   discharges. It is therefore of paramount importance to try and reduce or
   rather prevent these losses due to flood events. The main objective of
   this study is to ascertain flood events in Zimbabwe and discuss how best
   they can be managed for a sustainable future. The assessment is carried
   out using AQUEDUCT Global Flood Analyzer in which all the analysis is
   based on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population and the present
   and future (2030) urban damage. To estimate future changes and
   effectively suggest flood disaster management and mitigation strategies,
   three scenarios obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change 5th Assessment Report were utilized. A 5-year flood protection
   was then employed and the urban damage due to the flood events, the
   population at risk and the effects of this disaster on GDP was
   determined. This study outlined that in any given year, the majority of
   Zimbabwe has a low to a medium that is 2-3\% probability of flood
   occurrence in which a 5-year flood has a 20\% occurrence probability in
   any given year. If there is no flood protection employed, this 5-year
   flood could cause \$106.3 thousand affected population, \$32.4 million
   urban damage and \$67.9 million affected GDP. It is concluded that it is
   impossible to completely eliminate flood events, however, proposed
   mitigation measures, diminution approach and proper planning and
   preparation before their occurrence can reduce the environmental,
   economic and social losses.}},

Title = {{Driving into floodwater: A systematic review of risks, behaviour and
   mitigation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{31}},
Pages = {{953-963}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This systematic review summarises the findings of research focused on
   the risks associated with driving into floodwater. The review aims to
   compare and document the magnitude of the problem internationally;
   identifying the risk factors; exploring the application of theories and
   presence of theoretical models to explain people's risky behaviour; and
   documenting the intervention strategies utilised or proposed. Literature
   were searched from a number of databases (e.g. PsycInfo, ScienceDirect,
   Informit) for publication dates to 31 August 2017, then assessed based
   on their titles, abstracts and full texts and finally 24 articles were
   selected. This review compares flood fatality data from four countries
   (Australia, United States, Greece, and Sweden), groups identified risk
   factors from these selected studies into seven categories, and proposes
   a holistic integrated intervention model. The results of the review
   indicate that studies were predominantly conducted in Australia (10
   studies) and USA (7 studies). People's decisions to drive into, or turn
   back from, floodwater are identified as a consequence of both their risk
   perception and the combined impact of all other factors (e.g.
   individual, social, environmental etc.) that interdependently contribute
   to shape decision-making, The theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was the
   only theory that has been utilised within the literature to understand
   drivers' willingness to take risks. Improving people's decision-making
   through educational initiatives, advanced structural mechanisms,
   regulating existing edicts, and regularly evaluating the effectiveness
   of current strategies are identified as the best approaches to
   addressing the challenges in this area. Findings suggest that future
   studies require data and analysis from a larger range of countries, more
   comparative analyses within and between countries, an exploration of the
   relationship between risk factors and their relative level of influence
   and a greater application of behavioural and decision making theories.}},

Abstract = {{The risk presented by pluvial flooding has emerged as a critical issue
   in urban water management. Pluvial flooding occurs when precipitation
   intensity exceeds the capacity of natural and engineered drainage
   systems, and it is expected to increase in frequency, severity and
   impact through the 21st century due to the combined effects of climate
   change and urbanization. Although there have been recent advances in
   approaches to assess the risk presented pluvial flooding and to enhance
   the resilience of cities to its impacts, they have not been broadly
   implemented and there are many opportunities for additional research. We
   provide case studies of pluvial flooding in six cities in the
   continental United States, which serve as examples of the current
   vulnerability of cities that have not developed comprehensive pluvial
   flood management plans and the challenges in conducting pluvial flood
   research in light of existing data gaps. We also identify key research
   challenges that should be prioritized by the interdisciplinary water
   research community to better support urban resilience practice. This

Title = {{A quantitative methodology for the assessment of the regional economic

Abstract = {{Economic losses caused by flash floods are expected to rise worldwide in
   the coming decades, which is largely due to the increasing exposure of
   elements at risk. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the economic
   context of the potentially affected areas is highly recommendable.
   Numerous papers have been published to date that focus on quantifying
   vulnerability in general and in areas affected by floods in particular.
   However, the number of studies devoted to flash flood-prone areas is far
   lower. Integrated economic vulnerability assessment enables one to learn
   what characteristics explain, trigger, intensify, and attenuate the
   exposure, sensitivity, and resilience of economically vulnerable
   populations, which can be combined to achieve an Integrated Economic
   Vulnerability Index (IEVI). The methodology deployed here was conducted
   in Castilla y Leon (northwest Spain; 94.223 km(2)) and has allowed the
   economic vulnerability of urban areas to be analyzed, which has been
   primarily addressed by the estimation of economic losses or, more
   recently, including a few economic variables within social vulnerability
   assessments. Thus, 118 economic variables were initially gathered and
   then divided into groups through a hierarchical segmentation analysis.
   Subsequently, variables were combined employing a principal components
   analysis, giving rise to the economic vulnerability factors that were
   subsequently aggregated to construct the IEVI. Tolerance statistic was
   used as a weighting method to define the IEVI, whereas quintiles were
   chosen as a statistical criterion to map economic vulnerability. As a
   final step, latent class cluster analysis was implemented to identify
   spatial patterns of vulnerability. Our findings show that IEVI scores
   have a high spatial variability and a high degree of complexity in the
   relationships among different vulnerability factors. Moreover, they help
   to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability, which makes the design of
   suitable vulnerability reduction strategies possible, thereby improving
   the efficiency of flood risk management plans and policies.}},

Abstract = {{Nagpur city is among the fastest growing agglomerations of Central
   India. The city is considered to be a forerunner in sustainable
   development amist the rapid urbanization occurring in India. Though,
   selected under the ``smart city{''} project launched by the Indian
   government, the city faces many urban challenges ineffectively addressed
   by the current development plan. Haphazard and rapid infrastructural
   development without any comprehensive plan is leading to urban sprawl
   that compromises urban green infrastructure across the city. It excludes
   utilizing benefits of nature and ecosystem services to complement and
   reduce urban stress. This has led to wetland reductions, reduced water
   infiltration affecting the water table and causing water shortage, flash
   floods, significant loss of vegetation cover and biodiversity across the
   city and increased heat island effects. These issues along with current
   approach that discounts the importance of ecosystems-based approach has
   put forward many challenges and a question with regard to sustaining
   ``green image of the city{''}. To reduce risk against uncertainties, it
   is imperative to understand human-environment connections that involves
   diverse values and ecosystem services provided by the natural
   environment of the cities. Present study is a review of major issues
   raised due to un-planned development and addresses the feasibility and
   appropriateness of using the EbDRR approach. Environmental engineering
   based approaches having potential to transform Nagpur City into to a
   ``smart city{''} can set an example for other Indian cities to follow.
   This article facilitates understanding and practical applications of
   ecosystem based approaches and practices to counter negative impact of
   urbanization.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy precipitation on the south side of the central Alps produced a
   catastrophic flood in October 1868. We assess the damage and societal
   impacts, as well as the atmospheric and hydrological drivers using
   documentary evidence, observations and novel numerical weather and
   runoff simulations.
   The greatest damage was concentrated close to the Alpine divide and Lago
   Maggiore. An atmospheric reanalysis emphasizes the repeated occurrence
   of streamers of high potential vorticity as precursors of heavy
   precipitation. Dynamical downscaling indicates high freezing levels
   (4000ma. s.l.), extreme precipitation rates (max. 270mm24 h(-1)) and
   weather dynamics that agree well with observed precipitation and damage,
   and with existing concepts of forced low-level convergence, mid-level
   uplift and iterative northeastward propagation of convective cells.
   Simulated and observed peak levels of Lago Maggiore differ by 2 m,
   possibly because the exact cross section of the lake outflow is unknown.
   The extreme response of Lago Maggiore cannot be attributed to low forest
   cover. Nevertheless, such a paradigm was adopted by policy makers
   following the 1868 flood, and used to implement nationwide afforestation
   policies and hydraulic structures.
   These findings illustrate the potential of high-resolution,
   hydrometeorological models - strongly supported by histor-ical methods -
   to shed new light on weather events and their socio-economic
   implications in the 19th century.}},

Abstract = {{During the second half of 2010, the global climate system has been
   affected by the presence of anomalous cold conditions in the tropical
   Pacific related to a strong La Nina phenomenon, which continued
   throughout the first half of 2011, and had a second pulse in the boreal
   winter of 2011-2012. Climate patterns around the world were affected
   causing marked anomalies and important socioeconomic impacts in
   different countries. During this period, Colombia experienced a
   hydroclimatic anomaly expressed in precipitation levels above normal and
   extreme events such as flash floods, landslides, and long-term flooding
   of plains in different regions of the country. Losses and damages to
   infrastructure, crops, and livelihoods reached more than 7.8 billion US
   dollars (approximately 2\% of 2011 GDP). Due to the flooding of a vast
   area, about 2,350,000 people were affected, and as consequence most of
   them were expelled from their territories to live in alien territories
   in very difficult conditions; in these areas, many social conflicts
   either arose or worsened. Some of these conflicts are pointed out at the
   end of this chapter with the aim that they may serve as lessons for
   strengthening the regional disaster risk management for being better
   prepared against adverse impacts of similar extreme events in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are frequent events in Mexico that often lead to economic losses.
   Nonetheless, learning from these effects after such disasters that lead
   to improved preparedness and community resilience is limited. This paper
   analyzes the Magisterial community building resilience to flash floods.
   Based on Liao theoretical approach about the key properties of
   resilience, a survey was carried out based on household questionnaires
   and expert interviews in the selected study area. The analysis of
   building resilience community allowed the identification of strategies
   used to cope with flash floods and identify the aspects that have
   favored or inhibited the construction of resilience. In order to cope
   with flash floods, the community has promoted strategies independent of
   those carried out by the local government, but these do not have a
   significant contribution to resilience. Based on the results, it is
   established that the Magisterial community, although organized on its
   own initiative and having made adjustments through the implementation of
   strategies to cope with flash floods, is not a resilient community.
   However, fundamental aspects for the construction of resilience have
   been developed. A radical change in Mexico's flood risk management
   paradigm is required to promote resilience at all governance and
   decision-making levels.}},

Abstract = {{China is highly susceptible to flood disasters and subjected to great
   damage every year. Furthermore, the flood frequency has exhibited an
   increasing trend in recent years. Most flood events, including flash
   floods and river flood, are induced by rainfall. This study investigates
   annual variations of rainfall occurrence over China during the period
   from 2000 to 2015 at the national and regional scale using daily
   rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. The
   Mann-Kendall test is performed for trend detection, and statistical data
   of flood damage published by China's government, including destroyed
   crop area, damaged buildings, direct economic loss, percentage of GDP
   (gross domestic product), and death toll are correlatively analysed with
   rainfall occurrences. The results show that storm rain events show the
   greatest variation among three rainfall types (moderate rain, heavy rain
   and storm rain). The variation coefficients of rainfall over Northeast
   China, North China, and Northwest China are the highest, whereas that
   for Southwest China is the smallest. Moderate rain, heavy rain over
   Central China, and moderate rain over Southwest China exhibits
   decreasing trends, whereas the remaining exhibit increasing trends. The
   correlation between the rainfall occurrences and these flood damage
   indices at the national scale shows that only direct economic loss has a
   strong positive correlation with rainfall occurrences, and the other
   indices have weaker correlations. The correlation is strong in three
   north regions, except for death toll in Northwest China. In contrast,
   the correlation between flood damage and rainfall is weak in East China,
   Central China, Southwest China, and South China. Overall, death toll is
   strongly correlated with the number of damaged buildings, implying that
   flood fatalities in China are likely associated with building collapse,
   and are dominated by specific extreme events. This study can provide a
   scientific reference for flood management in China.}},

Abstract = {{Urban and land use planning is conditioned by flood risk analyses and is
   a great research challenge. While methods are available for quantitative
   hazard and risk modeling, there is still a major gap related to reliable
   rational approaches for vulnerability assessment. This is particularly
   true for assessing vulnerability of buildings to floods. This
   vulnerability, which is important for economic reasons as well as for
   the safety of individuals and communities, is usually conceptualized on
   an empirical basis. Such empirical approaches, however, are plagued by
   considerable uncertainties, mostly because the damage-causing mechanisms
   on the building envelope are poorly represented. In order to advance
   this area, this paper focuses on the structural vulnerability of
   traditional masonry buildings in alpine areas exposed to flash floods. A
   simplified physically based conceptual model which requires a limited
   amount of input data is proposed. The resistance of a wall impacted by a
   flash flood is studied in a limit analysis framework, considering
   different geometric ratios and building configurations. The resulting
   stability thresholds, expressed in dimensionless form as a function of
   the water depth, were positively compared with the results provided by
   numerical finite element models of the investigated geometries. The
   application of the proposed vulnerability model in risk mitigation
   strategies provides reliable information, suitable for a first-level
   risk assessment on large building stocks.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the recovery experiences of survivors of a flash
   flood event, five years after a natural disaster in South East
   Queensland. In-depth interviews were conducted with 33 of the original
   cohort of 120 post-disaster interviewees who experienced sudden
   traumatic bereavement and/or their own near-death experience. The data
   reveals that many of the survivors and rescuers were in worse-or far
   worse-situations than they had been in the weeks and months immediately
   after the disaster. Interviewees identified the worsening of their
   situation as being caused by systems failures by civil authorities,
   health care systems, welfare programmes and the insurance industry.
   Further research is recommended to assess the needs of people affected
   by natural disasters and the viability of a state-funded recovery scheme
   that could expedite personal, family and community recovery. The
   proposed scheme is based on the Queensland WorkCover scheme that
   scaffolds recovery and return to work for injured workers.}},

Abstract = {{On June 23, 2016, in less than 24 hours, up to ten inches of torrential
   rain fell in West Virginia. It was another of those
   one-in-every-1,000-year events that is occurring with frequency. There
   was also a brief tornado, but the flash floods throughout the state
   caused the major damage. In one county alone there were 15 deaths, and
   the victims included adults and young children who were swept away and
   drowned. Thousands lost homes, property, and jobs and many residents
   sought safety in the many shelters set up by the American Red Cross.
   Some residents who stayed in their homes were isolated and without
   power. They could not evacuate or get to shelters as dozens of roads
   were shut down or swept away and bridges across the state were damaged
   or destroyed. As the flooding receded and roads became passable, teams
   of Red Cross workers were deployed to assess the damage to homes, to
   pass out cleaning supplies, toiletries, meals, snacks, and water, and to
   offer mental health support.
   One team sat with a family in their home that was badly damaged. The
   parents reported to the DMH worker that they were more worried about
   their son than any of the property that was lost. Their eight-year-old
   was complaining about stomach aches and was not eating or sleeping as he
   had been before the storm. The mother said: ``It takes him an hour to
   get to sleep. He wants the light on and he wants one of us in there with
   him.{''} The DMH worker suggested that the boy be examined by their
   pediatrician to check for any possible medical issues. She then asked a
   series of questions about their experience of the disaster, including:
   Was any family member injured? Did they know anyone who died or was
   seriously injured? Could they tell her what the boy saw or heard during
   the storm? What did he and they lose? After about an hour of
   conversation the boy joined them and brought his pet turtle. He said
   that ``Scooter{''} was not hurt and was not afraid of the storm, as he
   was a good swimmer. The DMH worker then spoke with the parents alone.
   She explained that these were likely expected reactions to the
   devastating event that had just occurred and that the child's adjustment
   would probably coincide with home and school getting back to normal. She
   encouraged the parents to allow their son to talk about his feelings and
   that he would learn to deal with them. She also encouraged them to
   explain to him that he and they were safe ({''}All of us, even Scooter,
   are okay and will be okay{''}). She emphasized the importance for them
   to reestablish routines as soon as possible. If things didn't get better
   over the next few weeks, she suggested they contact their pediatrician
   to see about getting more help for his stress.}},

Abstract = {{Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability
   and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and
   exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role
   in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied ``Sponge
   City{''} plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective
   tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and
   beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this
   research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis,
   and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that
   CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also
   reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a
   depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35\% and
   inundation extents by 26.09-82.41\%, resulting in a slide of the exposed
   urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by
   0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies
   spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential
   combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could
   help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising
   pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood
   mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Cimanuk River, Garut District, West Java which have upper course in
   Papandayan Mountain have an important purpose in dialy living of Garut
   people as a water source. But in 2016 flash flood in this river was
   hitted and there was 26 peple dead and 23 peole gone. Flash flood which
   hitted last year make the settlement almost align with the ground,
   soaking school and hospital. BPLHD Jawa Barat saw this condition as a
   disaster which coused by distroyed upper course of Cimanuk River. Flash
   Flood which happened on the 2016 had ever made economic sector
   paralized.
   Least square method selected to analyze economic condition in residents
   affected post disaster, after the mathematical equations was determined
   by Cobb Douglas Method. By searching proportion value of the damage, and
   the result expected became a view to the stakeholder to know which
   sector that become a worse and be able to make a priority in development}},

Title = {{Assessment and review of hydrometeorological aspects for cloudburst and

Abstract = {{Impacts of global climate change can be seen worldwide, both on
   developing and developed economies. In recent years, numerous researches
   have been carried out by the Government and Non-Government agencies in
   understanding, assessing, predicting, and responding to expected
   processes of global climate change and recommend policies for
   mitigation. Extreme weather events like increased precipitation,
   cloudbursts, flashfloods, and avalanches in the mountainous region
   threaten human lives, and state and national economies. In the Indian
   Himalayan Region (IHR), well distributed hydrometeorological records
   (contemporary and historical) that facilitate the understanding of
   processes driving extreme weather events are scarce or rarely available.
   However, the capacity to observe, measure and quantify precipitation on
   regional scales has increased tremendously over the last three decades.
   Topography of the IHR provides favorable conditions for the cloudburst
   phenomenon which lead to frequent flashfloods and landslides; killing
   hundreds of people every year. Understanding the exact mechanism of the
   driving processes of cloudbursts such as orographic lifting,
   precipitation distribution, precipitation thresholds and its source or
   origin are still uncertain. Keeping in view that cloudbursts have been
   increasing in both their frequency and intensity, they are likely to
   intensify in the near future. Present study analyzes and critically
   summarizes facts and impacts of cloudburst events through compilation of
   hydrometeorological records and analysis of available data in the IHR.
   Results indicate that natural climate variability has played a much
   greater role in driving these extreme events than earlier thought. A
   general consensus is observed about the role of climate change, large
   atmospheric circulations, teleconnections and landuse-land-cover changes
   in driving these events. Therefore, in light of such challenges and
   potential research gaps, this paper aims at producing actionable
   knowledge in the IHR for climate modelers and policy planners to better
   serve the nation's needs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we seek to better understand the temporal and spatial
   aspects of climatic stress on local resource production systems and
   resource-use behaviors by including the perspectives of
   resource-dependent communities. Field research was conducted over a
   nine-month period in the remote north-eastern floodplain communities of
   Bangladesh, considered one of the most climate-vulnerable, least
   developed and under-studied regions in the country. This area is heavily
   dominated by wetland ecosystems, and subjected to regular seasonal flood
   and extreme rainfall events. Beyond these regular stresses, flash-floods
   and drought are the two most destructive climatic stresses on livelihood
   sustainability in the area. Data were collected in 12 villages bordering
   two significant wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), involving
   focus group discussions (n = 14), key informant interviews (n = 35) and
   household surveys (n = 356). Our results show that climatic stresses on
   rural livelihoods are catalyzed by human-induced environmental
   degradation and local resource use behaviors, contextual features that
   include both socio-economic and bio-physical properties. A climatic
   event appeared as a stress to livelihood sustainability when it happened
   in an untimely manner (e.g., flooding during resource harvesting
   periods) and directly affected the production process (e.g., agriculture
   and fisheries). We also found that human stress perceptions varied with
   the level of locally-driven innovation and adoption of technologies,
   which supports the important role of local experience and knowledge in
   adaptation planning. Further research is needed into how communities in
   different settings are already organizing to manage perceived climatic
   stresses, including traditional knowledge systems, local innovation
   networks and livelihood practices to help better con-textualize
   adaptation policy.}},

Abstract = {{There is a visible paradigm shift in disaster research from hazard and
   vulnerability assessment to developing framework for community
   resilience. Further, there is growing recognization in disaster science
   to develop framework to build resilience of the communities prone to
   natural hazards as highlighted by Sendai Framework for DRR 2015-2030.
   Again, community resilience especially early warning solution for Flash
   Floods, Debris flow and Land-slides in mountainous region of Afghanistan
   has escaped investigation and analysis. The objective of this paper is
   to explore the framework of existing monitoring/early warning systems
   (EWS) for landslides, mudslides and flood in selected villages/districts
   of district Badakhshan province. The framework is based on household
   questionnaire survey among 144respondents selected through purposive
   sampling method. The Climate-related Disaster Community Resilience
   Framework (CDCRF) revealed that there diminishing resilience culture
   among the communities in conflict prone area of Badakhshan Mountain.
   However, despite their exposure to the climate induced extreme events,
   the community has not been able to develop their coping capacity. It has
   also been observer that the primary reason for diminishing resilience
   culture among communities, lack of public accesses to science based
   information, degradation of indigenous knowledge on hazard, gendered
   livelihood transformation and limited adaptive capacity. The paper has
   proposed a new framework of Early Warning Solution for Flash Floods,
   Debris flow and Land-slides, which has wider implication for disaster
   management and emergency planning in the mountains of conflict prone
   area of Afghanistan.}},

Title = {{An integrated approach of ground and aerial observations in flash flood

Abstract = {{On November 15, 2017, a high intensity convective storm, reaching 300 mm
   in 13 h in the core zone of the event, hit the western part of the
   region of Attica in Greece, causing a catastrophic flash flood in the
   town of Mandra and a tragic loss of 24 people, making it the most deadly
   flood in the country, in a period of 40 years.
   The research team surveyed the area during and after the flood using a
   combination of systematic ground and aerial observations with the aid of
   an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aiming to reconstruct the basic
   physical and hydrological characteristics of the flood and its impacts.
   The analysis produced detailed flood extent and depth maps that provided
   a comprehensive description of the physical characteristics of
   floodwaters across the inundated area. Peak discharge was estimated,
   using a UAV-derived digital surface model, at two locations,
   corresponding to the two main tributaries and indicated an impressive
   hydrological response, between 9 and 10 m(3)/s/km(2). Impact analysis on
   the basis of these observations showed an extensive diversity, including
   effects in geomorphology, vegetation, buildings, infrastructure and
   human population.
   Analysis of meteorological, botanical and geomorphological evidence lead
   to the conclusion that this flash flood was a very rare event.
   Results demonstrate that the combination of aerial and ground
   observations allow an enhanced and holistic reconstruction of a flash
   flood and its impacts with high accuracy, leading to the conclusion that
   the approach used has a significant potential in many aspects of flood
   disaster investigations.}},

Title = {{Disaster scenario simulation of the 2010 cloudburst in Leh, Ladakh,
   India}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In August 2010, Leh district in the Ladakh region of north-western India
   experienced a disaster when a cloudburst generated debris flows, killed
   hundreds of people, destroyed houses, and damaged the hospital,
   communication infrastructure, the bus station, and vital roads. A
   simulation of the Leh cloudburst disaster analysed the disaster itself,
   disaster risk reduction plans in the region, gaps in existing response
   mechanisms and reducing hazard impacts in the future. The participant
   group comprised academic researchers and industry experts in natural
   hazards, social vulnerability, engineering, historical and social
   sciences, education, journalism, disaster management and disaster risk
   reduction. Many of the participants had extensive local knowledge of
   Ladakh or comparable neighbouring Himalayan regions. Following the
   disaster, Leh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC), produced a
   District Disaster Management Plan (DDMP), which addressed many of the
   gaps identified in the simulation. Most importantly, the document
   outlined a civil protection mechanism to respond to future hazardous
   events. This was utilised to assess future disaster response in the
   simulation scenario. From analysis of the scenario simulation, the role
   of the army was found to be key in minimizing the impact of the 2010
   disaster, although in the future, the army may coordinate with the civil
   protection body as set out in the DDMP. Participants identified the lack
   of a local formalized civil protection plan as a major vulnerability,
   and the most vulnerable populations as the migrant communities. The
   group also discussed evidence of resilience among the population such as
   the role of monasteries and spirituality in psychological recovery and
   the impact of the initial local response. From broader discussion of the
   simulation scenario, it was possible to identify aspects of resilience
   for further study in a wider research project, such as identifying
   hazardous slopes from satellite mapping, informing the fieldwork
   program, designing social questionnaires to understand risk perception
   and formulating questions to guide focus-group discussions on community
   resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Certain rural settlements situated in the floodplain area are exposed to
   a high risk of flash-floods, in case a sudden damage appeared in the

   anticipation of hydrological risk in this type of areas in case of a
   simultaneous occurrence of two types of hazard: torrential rain and
   damages to the supply water system network. Therefore we will use an
   ArcGIS procedure of building flash-floods scenarios generated by extreme
   events, namely the high level of soil saturation, damages to the supply
   water system network and a high intensity torrential rain. The article
   presents different scenarios according to the return period (T) of the
   torrential rain: T=20 years, T=100 years and T=1000 years. The results
   will highlight the several vulnerability categories of the terrain and
   households related to combined risk. The flash-floods scenarios in the
   rural settlements that benefit from a supply water system network will
   be of great use to the local administrative authorities for the

Abstract = {{This article focuses on conceptual and methodological developments
   allowing the integration of physical and social dynamics leading to
   model forecasts of circumstance-specific human losses during a flash
   flood. To reach this objective, a random forest classifier is applied to
   assess the likelihood of fatality occurrence for a given circumstance as
   a function of representative indicators. Here, vehicle-related
   circumstance is chosen as the literature indicates that most fatalities
   from flash flooding fall in this category. A database of flash flood
   events, with and without human losses from 2001 to 2011 in the United
   States, is supplemented with other variables describing the storm event,
   the spatial distribution of the sensitive characteristics of the exposed
   population, and built environment at the county level. The catastrophic
   flash floods of May 2015 in the states of Texas and Oklahoma are used as
   a case study to map the dynamics of the estimated probabilistic human
   risk on a daily scale. The results indicate the importance of time- and
   space-dependent human vulnerability and risk assessment for short-fuse
   flood events. The need for more systematic human impact data collection
   is also highlighted to advance impact-based predictive models for flash

   includes the parameters of flood water level, flood duration, and
   repeated flooding. Secondary data from relevant departments and agencies
   are gathered for the analysis. Flood statistics were obtained from the
   annual flood reports issued by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage
   Malaysia between 1991 and 2014. Road data as well as maps were collected
   from the Highway Planning Division, Ministry of Works Malaysia. In this
   study, flash flood was defined as flood that subsides in less than 6 hr.
   The study revealed that the average flood depths could be grouped into
   0.3 m, 0.6 m and 1.0 m depths. However, in areas under tidal effect, the
   depths could exceed 1.0 m and it took longer for the flood to subside,

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{568}},

Abstract = {{Flood risk management is gradually shifting from a risk-based approach
   to an integrated one that, among other elements, considers risk
   communication (RC) as a means of boosting resilience. Regardless of the
   above, few scientists have tackled up to now the integration of RC into
   flood risk management. In this connection, this particular study seeks
   to check out the potential of a risk dialogue approach (based on an ad
   hoc RC strategy) to change attitudes and behaviours in relation to flash
   flood risk. Via a pre-post survey design, we evaluated risk perception
   and awareness regarding a Civil Protection Plan (CPP) implemented
   locally (i.e., in the municipality of Navaluenga, central Spain). For
   this particular objective, a questionnaire survey was created, and 201
   adults (representing more than 10\% of the population census) were
   interviewed twice in a one-year period. Before the second survey, an RC
   strategy was created. The RC strategy comprised briefings, quiz answers,
   storytelling, a contest of videos and photographs about past floods, and
   an intergenerational workshop. A t-test for paired sample analyses and a
   general linear model (GLM) repeated measures ANOVA were applied to
   identify changes in risk perception and awareness. Our results indicate
   that the RC strategy did increase flood risk perception in Navaluenga in
   the long term (lifetime). Also, it increased the level of awareness of
   the various features that comprise the CPP, enabling people to be more
   competent in facing a flash flood. Some cognitive biases detected in the
   perceptual process of human beings may shed some light on the results
   obtained. The implementation of well-thought-out RC strategies can play
   a role in improving resilience, particularly in geographic areas such as
   the Iberian Peninsula, in which climate change scenarios indicate a
   likely increase in the severity and frequency of flooding.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the drivers behind urban floods is critical for reducing
   its devastating impacts to human and society. This study investigates
   the impacts of recent urban development on hydrological runoff and urban
   flood volumes in a major city located in northern China, and compares
   the urbanization impacts with the effects induced by climate change
   under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6 and 8.5).We
   then quantify the role of urban drainage system in mitigating flood
   volumes to inform future adaptation straiegies. A geospatial database on
   landuse types, surface imperviousness and drainage systems is developed
   and used as inputs into the SWMM urban drainage model to estimate the
   flood volumes and related risks under various urbanization and climate
   change scenarios. It is found that urbanization has led to an increase
   in annual surface runoff by 208 to 413\%, but the changes in urban flood
   volumes can vary greatly depending on performance of drainage system
   along the development. Specifically, changes caused by urbanization in
   expected annual flood volumes are within a range of 194 to 942\%, which
   are much higher than the effects induced by climate change under the RCP
   2.6 scenario (64 to 200\%). Through comparing the impacts of
   urbanization and climate change on urban runoff and flood volumes, this
   study highlights the importance for re-assessment of current and future
   urban drainage in coping with the changing urban floods induced by local
   and large-scale changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intense rainfall-runoff events and subsequent soil erosion can cause
   serious damage to the infrastructure in residential areas in Europe
   countries and all over the world. In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of
   the Interior has supported an analysis dealing with the risks to
   residents, infrastructure, and water bodies from flash floods and
   sediment transport. A total of more than 150,000 risk points were
   identified by GIS morphology and land-use analysis. The threat, the
   vulnerability, and the resulting risk category were determined for each
   of these points. The WaTEM/SEDEM model was used to assess the threat
   with 10-m data resolution. The summarized vulnerability of real objects
   on individual runoff trajectories was combined with the threat of
   sediment transport, resulting in the overall risk represented by a
   5-degree scale, from lowest (1) to highest (5). The output of the
   project lies stored in the WEB application. Nineteen percent of the
   sites in the Czech Republic, i.e., more than 23,000 sites, have been
   assigned to categories 4 and 5, with a high level of risk. Thirty-four
   percent of cadastral units are classified as the high risky (4416
   cadasters, with a total area 24,707km(2)). Approximately 30\% of the
   population of the Czech Republic lives in high-risk cadastral areas.
   Four scenarios of protection were modeled. To reduce the high-risk and
   very high-risk sites (categories 4 and 5), the most effective solution
   is the implementation of technical measures or conversion to grassland
   within the contributing watersheds. This could reduce the number of
   high-risk sites from 23,400 to 3700.Methods of sediment transport
   modeling and risk evaluation, based on presented USLE input data and
   documented WaTEM/SEDEM model, can be used worldwide. Especially in
   post-soviet union countries with shared arable land development and
   erosion consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Schools and students are particularly vulnerable to natural hazards,
   especially pluvial flooding in cities. This paper presents a
   scenario-based study that assesses the school vulnerability of emergency
   services (i.e., Emergency Medical Service and Fire \& Rescue Service) to
   urban pluvial flooding in the city center of Shanghai, China through the
   combination of flood hazard analysis and GIS-based accessibility
   mapping. Emergency coverages and response times in various traffic
   conditions are quantified to generate school vulnerability under normal
   no-flood and 100-y pluvial flood scenarios. The findings indicate that
   severe pluvial flooding could lead to proportionate and linear impacts
   on emergency response provision to schools in the city. Only 11\% of all
   the schools is predicted to be completely unreachable (very high
   vulnerability) during flood emergency but the majority of the schools
   would experience significant delay in the travel times of emergency
   responses. In this case, appropriate adaptations need to be particularly
   targeted for specific hot-spot areas (e.g., new urbanized zones) and
   crunch times (e.g., rush hours).}},

Abstract = {{The field research in this book is about human and natural replies to
   main climate change-associated effects as storms, floods, and landslides
   in two areas: the Ky Anh coastal district in the North Central Vietnam
   and the Van Chan mountainous district in the Northern Vietnam. While in
   the open literature ample attention is given to these climate
   change-associated effects in deltas and in the lowlands near the sea,
   less information is available about how people in the mountains
   experience and adapt to the changing mountainous climate.
   Climate variation exists in a long country as Vietnam bordered by an
   over 3000-km-long coast. Therefore this chapter overviews the changing
   climate in the wider geographical context of both study areas: the 6
   coastal provinces of North Central Vietnam and the 15 provinces of the
   Northern mountainous region. The first part of this regional approach
   describes core climate aspects as temperature and wet precipitation
   along the coast of Central Vietnam. This is followed by the
   phenomenology of storms, flash floods, droughts, and landslides. This
   section is concluded with an analysis of the vulnerability of the six
   main sectors in this area: agri-and aquaculture, forestry, industry,
   tourism, and the dense population living here. The second part of this
   chapter aims at a similar approach adapted to the mountains in the
   northern part of the country. Temperature changes and drought are
   analyzed, next to floods, flash floods, landslides, and periods of
   drought and (low) temperature extremes.}},

   characteristics: (i) from regional to local, and (ii) from qualification
   to quantification. The Guangzhou Metro System is used to demonstrate the
   application of the perspective methods for flood risk assessment of
   metro system. The risk prevention procedure uses an iterative cycle that
   includes risk assessment, precaution, prediction, and technical

Abstract = {{Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change given its low
   capacities of resilience to the enormous challenges climate change will
   pose. Research aimed at evaluating changes in hydrological trends and
   methods of adaptation was conducted in the Niger Basin parts of Benin at
   the peak of the rainy season in the year 2012. Rainfall and river
   discharge were analyzed from 1950-2010 in order to generate patterns of
   changes in the region. Structured questionnaires were used to evaluate
   the perceptions of 14 farming communities on climate-related issues and
   their methods of adaptations. Mann-Kendall and Pettit trend analyses
   were conducted for rainfall and river discharge. The findings indicated
   that significant decreases characterized rainfall and river discharge in
   the period of study. Flash flood was considered the major challenge
   faced in the region according to more than 90\% of crop, animal, and
   fish farmers. Aside from that, decrease in water availability was
   identified as an additional challenge. Irrigation, diversification,
   water treatment, drainage, small dams, and dikes were reported as the
   common adaptation mechanisms in the catchments. This study will help in
   designing sustainable adaptation mechanisms to abrupt changes in the

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{World Heritage sites in general are exposed to the impacts of natural
   hazards, which threaten their integrity and may compromise their value.
   Floods are a severe threat to the Angkor World Heritage site. Studies of
   regional floods and flood hazard zoning have played an increasingly
   important role in ensuring sustainability of the Angkor site. This study
   developed a flood hazard index (FHI) model based on a geographic
   information system (GIS) and used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to
   extract historical floods at Angkor from 2007 to 2013. Four indices
   (flood affected frequency, absolute elevation, elevation standard
   deviation, drainage density) were used to identify flood-prone areas.
   The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Delphi method were employed
   to determine the weight of each index. The weighted indices were then
   used to develop a distribution map of flood hazards at Angkor. The
   results show that 9 monuments are at risk by potential floods among the
   52 components of the Angkor monuments. The high hazard and
   moderate-to-high hazard areas in the core zone are mainly located
   surrounding the West Baray but will not bring direct risk impact on the
   monuments located in the core archaeological zone. The moderate hazard
   areas are located on both sides of the Siem Reap and Roluos rivers and
   in the flooded area of the Tonle Sap Lake in the core archaeological
   zone. These areas cover 19.4 km(2), accounting for 9.13\% of the total
   area of the core zone. This moderate hazard zone poses a greater flood
   threat to the core zone and must be given higher attention. The buffer
   zone is a small area with fewer sites. As such, flooding has a low
   impact on the buffer zone. The methods used in this study can be applied
   to flood hazard assessments of other heritage sites in Southeast Asia.}},

Abstract = {{The last decade has witnessed the development of methodologies for the
   post-flood documentation of both hydrogeomorphological and social
   response to extreme precipitation. These investigations are particularly
   interesting for the case of flash floods, whose space-time scales make
   their observations by conventional hydrometeorological monitoring
   networks particularly challenging. Effective flash flood documentation
   requires post-flood survey strategies encompassing accurate radar
   estimation of rainfall, field and remote-sensing observations of the
   geomorphic processes, indirect reconstruction of peak discharges-as well
   eyewitness interviews. These latter can give valuable information on
   both flood dynamics and the related individual and collective responses.
   This study describes methods for post-flood surveys based on
   interdisciplinary collaborations between natural and social scientists.
   These surveys may help to better understand the links between
   hydrometeorological dynamics and geomorphic processes as well as the

Abstract = {{Identifying flood risk-prone areas in the regions of extreme aridity

   of the flood risk depending on spatial analytic hierarchy process of the
   integration between both Remote Sensing Techniques (RST) and Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS). This integration results in enhancing the
   analysis with the savings of time and efforts. There are several remote
   sensing-based data used in conducting this research, including a digital
   elevation model with an accuracy of 30m, spatial soil and geologic maps,
   historical daily rainfall records, and data on rainwater drainage
   systems. Five return periods (REPs) (2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and
   200years) corresponding to flood hazards and vulnerability developments
   maps were applied via the weighted overlay technique. Although the
   results indicate lower rates of annual rainfall (53-71mm from the
   southeast to the northwest), the city has been exposed to destructive
   flash floods. The flood risk categories for a 100-year REP were very
   high, high, medium, low, and very low with 17\%, 41\%, 33\%, 8\%, and
   1\% of total area, respectively. These classes correspond to residential
   zones and principal roads, which lead to catastrophic flash floods.
   These floods have caused socioeconomic losses, soil erosion,
   infrastructure damage, land degradation, vegetation loss, and
   submergence of cities, as well life loss. The results prove the GIS and
   RST effectiveness in mitigating flood risks and in helping decision
   makers in flood risk mitigation and rainwater harvesting.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{129-146}},

Abstract = {{The 2013 Uttarakhand flash flood was such a surprise for those at risk
   that the predominant source of information for their risk was
   environmental cues and, secondarily, peer warnings rather than official
   warnings. Of those who received warnings, few received information other
   than the identity of the flood threat. A survey of 316 survivors found
   that most people's first response was to immediately evacuate but some
   stayed to receive additional information, confirm their warnings, or
   engage in evacuation preparations. Unfortunately, engaging in these
   milling behaviors necessarily delayed their final evacuations. Mediation
   analysis revealed that psychological reactions mediated the relationship
   between information sources and behavioral responses. Further analyses
   revealed that immediate evacuation and evacuation delay were both
   predicted best by information search and positive affect, but
   correlation analyses indicated that a number of other models were also
   plausible. Final evacuation was best predicted by immediate evacuation
   and, to a significantly lesser extent, household together. Overall,
   results suggest that the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) should
   be considered a useful framework for examining household responses to
   flash floods in developing countries like India. It supports the
   conclusion that a household's first warning source is a function of two
   distinct detection and dissemination systems within a community-an
   official system and an informal system. However, it fails to capture

Abstract = {{Hurricane Harvey (2017) caused widespread flash flooding by extremely
   heavy rainfall and resulted in tremendous damage, including 82
   fatalities and huge economic loss in the Houston, Texas area. To reduce
   hazards, loss, and to improve urban resilience, it is important to
   understand the factors that influence the occurrence of flooding events.
   People rely on natural resources and different land uses to reduce the
   severity of flood impacts and mitigate the risk. In this study, we
   focused the impacts of land use on Hurricane-Harvey-induced flooding
   inside and outside the Houston city center. With the recent trend that
   more citizen scientists serve in delivering information about natural
   disaster response, local residents in Houston areas participated in
   delineating the flooded areas in Hurricane Harvey. The flooding
   information used here generated a published map with citizen-contributed
   flooding data. A regional model framework with spatial autocovariates
   was employed to understand those interactions. Different land use
   patterns and types affected the potential of flooding events differently
   inside and outside Houston's city center. Explicitly, we found
   agricultural and open space were associated with high risk of flooding
   outside the city center, industrial lands increased the high risk of
   flooding in city center, and residential areas reduced the potential of
   flooding both inside and outside the city center. The results can assist
   with future land use strategy in Houston and other areas, and mitigate
   potential flash flooding. This study also highlighted the contribution
   of citizen science to responses to natural hazards.}},

Title = {{Real-Time Urban Inundation Prediction Combining Hydraulic and
   Probabilistic Methods}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Damage caused by flash floods is increasing due to urbanization and
   climate change, thus it is important to recognize floods in advance. The
   current physical hydraulic runoff model has been used to predict
   inundation in urban areas. Even though the physical calculation process
   is astute and elaborate, it has several shortcomings in regard to
   real-time flood prediction. The physical model requires various data,
   such as rainfall, hydrological parameters, and one-/two-dimensional
   (1D/2D) urban flood simulations. In addition, it is difficult to secure
   lead time because of the considerable simulation time required. This
   study presents an immediate solution to these problems by combining
   hydraulic and probabilistic methods. The accumulative overflows from
   manholes and an inundation map were predicted within the study area.
   That is, the method for predicting manhole overflows and an inundation
   map from rainfall in an urban area is proposed based on results from
   hydraulic simulations and uncertainty analysis. The Second Verification
   Algorithm of Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs (SVNARX)
   model is used to learn the relationship between rainfall and overflow,
   which is calculated from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
   Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). In addition, a Self-Organizing
   Feature Map (SOFM) is used to suggest the proper inundation area by
   clustering inundation maps from a 2D flood simulation model based on
   manhole overflow from SWMM. The results from two artificial neural
   networks (SVNARX and SOFM) were estimated in parallel and interpolated
   to provide prediction in a short period of time. Real-time flood
   prediction with the hydraulic and probabilistic models suggested in this
   study improves the accuracy of the predicted flood inundation map and
   secures lead time. Through the presented method, the goodness of fit of
   the inundation area reached 80.4\% compared with the verified 2D
   inundation model.}},

Abstract = {{Managing a disaster is a very complex issue in which both the people and
   the affected region of the particular country are involved. In
   disasters, the vision of reality entails proper understanding of
   complexity, uncertainty and instability in the backdrop of nonlinear
   dynamics. Decision making in case of disasters is a nonlinear thread
   which has to wind its way through various rhythms and systems that range
   from ground reality to management operations.
   The Uttarakhand disaster of 2013 is not a simple straight line extension
   of a house fire or an automobile accident. It is a mixed web of
   complexity, nonlinearity, instability and chaos. Maintaining hierarchy
   in decision making and managing a disaster of such magnitude in public
   domain has been found to be ineffective in operations. The theory of
   chaos and the science of complexity can lead to better disaster
   management options. In fact, chaos theory provides viable framework for
   management of natural disasters. Chaos theory describes how the human
   society influences the reality. Indeed, in some degrees, the society
   relevant for the region creates it.
   In the Indian Himalayas in Uttarakhand state, during the third week of
   June 2013, intermittent and unprecedented precipitation covering large
   area led to flash floods and landslides. They carried away everything
   resulting in colossal loss of life and property. Incoherencies in
   management occurred mainly because of lack of understanding of nonlinear
   dynamics and deterministic chaos in natural phenomena and a fixed
   approach i.e. `mode lock-in' approach in decision making.
   In this article, the disaster situation is established to have been
   initiated due to forces of deterministic chaos. On this basis, some
   suggestions are formulated where help of the chaos theory may prove
   congenial to decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanisation alters the natural system, such as land cover from natural
   vegetation and agriculture to urban structures. Such changes are due to
   the demands of development which significantly change stormwater flow
   and constructed drainage systems. Problems relating to the present
   stormwater program have been identified; one of the major environmental
   effects, as a result of improper stormwater management, is flash floods.
   Hence, this study focuses on the benefits of landscape approach via the
   use of low-impact development strategies combined with soft landscape
   engineering in solving flash flood issues. Section 13, Shah Alam,
   Malaysia was chosen as the study area as it has experienced serious
   flash flood problems for many years. Regardless of several solutions,
   the situation remains the same due to the current water peak runoff
   which has drastically increased since 2003 as a result of 34.8\%
   development. This site was also selected due to its rapid development.
   For these reasons, its current situation was observed and studied. The
   management of public spaces have been identified as the key factors in
   improving the current water peak runoff problems. Therefore, design
   solutions have been proposed for the study area in which the estimation
   of water peak runoff can be reduced by 7.9\%, which is equal to 81.77
   m3/h. It is hoped that this study can be used as a guideline in
   understanding the process of urban environmental enhancement as well as
   a tool for solving issues related to flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to explore whether a relationship exists between extreme

   districts in Bangladesh that are vulnerable to extreme weather events:
   Sunamganj, which experiences flash flooding, and Brahmanbaria, which

   120 randomly selected household heads from two villages in these
   districts, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 household
   heads who indicated early marriage was a coping strategy for managing
   effects of weather events. The mixed-methods study finds that early
   marriage of daughters is a coping strategy for managing two negative
   consequences of extreme weather events. First, by minimizing household
   expenses, householders can pay for damage-related expenses. Second,
   unmarried daughters may be subject to sexual violence during a crisis,
   especially in temporary shelters, which would harm both the family's and
   daughter's reputation and prevent future marriage.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to understand community risk perception to environmental
   hazards in a border conflict zone context in high-mountain areas.
   Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools were applied by the social
   science team. The results were validated with a hazard map prepared by a
   separate team comprised of geologists. Turtuk, the northernmost village
   in Ladakh, India located near the line of control with Pakistan was
   undertaken as a case study. Turtuk represents a high mountain indigenous
   rural community which has experienced several catastrophic disasters
   (flash flooding and landslides in 2010, 2014, and 2015) and territorial
   armed conflicts (wars in 1971 and 1999 with Pakistan) in recent times.
   The villagers were able to identify various environmental hazards and
   associated risk zones through participatory timeline diagram, and hazard
   and dream mapping exercises. The PRA maps matched the geological hazard
   map of Turtuk, demonstrating that community people are highly aware of
   surrounding hazards regardless of differences in age, sex, education,
   occupation, and religion. They apply indigenous knowledge to deal with
   the adverse climate and calamities. The technique, of analysing
   community vulnerability in the context of conflict and disasters by

   Tehran, Iran}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{35}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Operationalizing the concept of urban disaster resilience is a major
   milestone toward understanding both the characteristics that contribute
   to the resilience of cities to natural hazards and the interactions
   required to build and sustain it. While the measurement of urban
   disaster resilience has recently gained much attention, there is so far
   no optimal approach for operationalizing this concept and therefore
   there is a need to conduct more empirical studies on what constitutes
   disaster resilience and how to assess it. In this study, a resilience
   assessment focuses on the inherent characteristics and capacities of
   Tehran in the context of flash floods from surface water or from the
   overflow of rivers. The measurement approach is based on constructing a
   composite index based on six resilience dimensions social, economic,
   institutional, infrastructural, community capital and environmental of
   community flood resilience. This follows by developing a hybrid
   multi-criteria decision-making method. The applied method is a
   combination of the AHP for prioritizing the selected indicators and the
   TOPSIS tools in order to get Tehran's urban districts ranked based on
   their resilience levels. Data were mostly from the Statistical Center of
   Iran and Tehran Municipality's accessible data sources. The results
   clarify that Districts 6 and 22 are comparatively the most resilient
   districts, while District 1 is the only district with the lowest level
   of resilience. Such place-based assessments have an opportunity to track
   community performance over time and provide the tool to decision-makers
   in order to integrate resilience thinking into urban development and
   resilience-oriented urban planning.}},

Abstract = {{The recent severe weather events in May and June 2018 have once again
   made us realize that heavy rainfall induced flash floods can occur
   everywhere, anytime and often be very local in various forms and
   consequences - a heavy rain risk exists basically in every German
   municipality! However, efficient and standardized hazard and risk maps
   are missing throughout Germany. A uniform and systematic procedure for
   documentation and risk analysis for heavy rainfall events does not
   currently exist. Actual warnings are only based on the precipitation or
   rather on the intensity of the rainfall, whereby the real threat due to
   flash floods is just as insufficiently considered as the vulnerability
   of the urban structures. This article presents an approach for a

Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {{212-225}},

Abstract = {{In arid areas, water diverted from highly uncertain flash floods is
   often the only source of water for crop production. Stakeholders in
   spate irrigation systems have developed numerous measures to cope with
   uncertain water supply related to low, high and untimely floods. This
   research evaluates the effectiveness of these measures using the MULINO
   Decision Support System (mDSS4) tool which is based on the Driving
   force-PressureState-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. Using data from
   interviews with 101 randomly selected farmers, 17 water user
   associations (WUAs), and 7 system water managers in the Gash spate
   irrigation system in Sudan, we compare the effectiveness with the rate
   of adoption. The results reveal the most effective measures are 1)
   pre-flood preparedness, 2) risk sharing measures through water and land
   management during and after flood by WUAs, 3) crop management by
   farmers; and 4) flexibility in operation by water managers.
   Unfortunately, the most effective measures are not the most adopted
   ones. The level of adoption is primarily related to the capacity of the
   farmers, WUAs and water managers to implement the measures without
   outside support. Generally, measures taken by downstream farmers are
   less effective than those adopted by upstream farmers due to weak
   institutional arrangements and lack of adequate resources. Supporting
   farmers, WUAs and water managers for a wider adoption of the existing
   effective measures will greatly improve irrigation performance and hence

Title = {{Risk-Based Early Warning System for Pluvial Flash Floods: Approaches and
   Foundations}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{In times of increasing weather extremes and expanding vulnerable cities,
   a significant risk to civilian security is posed by heavy rainfall
   induced flash floods. In contrast to river floods, pluvial flash floods
   can occur anytime, anywhere and vary enormously due to both terrain and
   climate factors. Current early warning systems (EWS) are based largely
   on measuring rainfall intensity or monitoring water levels, whereby the
   real danger due to urban torrential floods is just as insufficiently
   considered as the vulnerability of the physical infrastructure. For this
   reason, this article presents a concept for a risk-based EWS as one
   integral component of a multi-functional pluvial flood information
   system (MPFIS). Taking both the pluvial flood hazard as well as the
   damage potential into account, the EWS identifies the urban areas
   particularly affected by a forecasted heavy rainfall event and issues
   object-precise warnings in real-time. Further, the MPFIS performs a
   georeferenced documentation of occurred events as well as a systematic
   risk analysis, which at the same time forms the foundation of the
   proposed EWS. Based on a case study in the German city of Aachen and the
   event of 29 May 2018, the operation principle of the integrated
   information system is illustrated.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Under climate change, flash floods have become more frequent and severe,
   and are posing a danger to society, especially in the ungauged
   catchments. The objective of this paper, is to construct a simple and
   early warning system, serving for flash floods risk management in the
   ungauged catchments of the Loess Plateau in China, and offer a reference
   for flash flood warning in other areas in the world. Considering the
   absence of hydrological data in the ungauged catchments, the early
   warning system for flash floods is established by combining the regional
   or watershed isograms of hydrological parameters and local empirical
   formulas. Therein, rainfall and water stage/flow are used as warning
   indices for real-time risk estimation of flash flood. For early warning,
   the disaster water stage was first determined according to the protected
   objects (e.g., residents and buildings), namely the critical water
   stage. The critical flow (flow threshold), was calculated based on the
   water stage, and the established relationship between water stage and
   flow using the cross-sectional measured data. Then, according to the
   flow frequency curve of the design flood, the frequency of critical flow
   was ascertained. Assuming that the rainfall and the flood have the same
   frequency, the critical rainfall threshold was calculated through the
   design rainstorm with the same frequency of the design flood. Due to the
   critical rainfall threshold being sensitive with different soil
   conditions, the design flood and frequency curve of flood flow were
   calculated under different soil conditions, and thus the rainfall
   threshold was given under different soil condition for early warning of
   the flash flood disaster. Taking two sections in Zichang County (within
   the Loess Plateau) as an example, we set the rainfall and water
   stage/flow thresholds to trigger immediate or preparation signals for
   the migration of the population along the river. The application of this
   method to the 7.26 flood events in 2017 in China, shows that the early
   warning system is feasible. It is expected that this simple early
   warning system can provide early warnings of flash floods in ungauged
   catchments in the Loess Plateau and other similar areas.}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{A large city surrounded by mountains like Hong Kong is susceptible to
   both flash floods in midmountain areas and local flooding in low-lying
   areas when a large rainstorm occurs. Severe rainstorms tend to be more
   frequent under a changing climate. Hence, it is essential to simulate
   rainfall-runoff processes in the urban area and evaluate flood coping
   strategies. This paper presents a model that is capable of simulating
   the overland flow process and underground drainage hydraulics
   simultaneously, based on detailed topographic, rainfall, and drainage
   network information about the northern Hong Kong Island. The model was
   calibrated with a flood-extent map and further validated with a flood
   event in June 2008. Using the model, the flood hazards associated with
   flood coping projects in three phases were simulated. Although these
   flooding control measures were intended to meet a major societal need
   for alleviating flooding problems and are shown to be effective in
   alleviating local flooding, the densely urbanized area may still suffer
   flooding when severe storm events occur. Hence, new strategies are
   needed to cope with the urban flood risk under more critical storms.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of flooding ranks top among natural disasters in terms of
   both the number of people affected globally, and the proportion of
   individual fatalities per case. The potential for flood causalities and
   damages is increasing in Africa due to social and demographic
   development raising pressure on land use. Furthermore, the evidence of
   increasingly heavy precipitation due to climate change supports the view
   that flood hazard is expected to increase in frequency and severity in
   many areas of Niger.
   Niger is one of the countries most vulnerable to climatic risks, and the
   Tillaberi region is exposed to different typologies of floods: flash
   floods associated with short, high intensity rainfalls, mainly of
   convective origin and occurring locally, and floods on larger
   catchments, such as the Niger River, where dangerous episodes derive
   from a regional combination of precipitations and runoff effects. As
   such, flash flooding usually impact basins less than 1,000 km(2) with
   response times of a few hours or less, while large river basins have the
   response times of several days to months. Investigating these aspects in
   this area is difficult due to a lack of systematic observational data
   for flash floods, encompassing data on the flood-generating rainfall at
   the required space and time detail.
   This case study aims to support local institutions and organizations in
   the design and implementation of disaster risk management policies in
   reducing Niger's vulnerability to recurrent natural disasters, as well
   as integrating the role of local authorities in building community
   disaster prevention and preparedness. The study proposes a methodology
   to classify each single municipality in the Tillaberi region based on
   its specific flood hazard characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods continue a trend of costly disasters attributed to changing
   weather patterns and climate disruptions. Small and Medium-Sized
   Enterprises (SMEs) are more vulnerable and ill-prepared to flash
   flooding, compared to their larger counterparts, so they are

   reports on the results of a quantitative survey of SME owners/managers
   and employs quantile regression analysis in an attempt to shed light on
   factors affecting resilience barriers to flash floods. Findings suggest
   that the effect of organizational size on SME barriers is reduced as
   barriers increase. In contrast, the effect of organizational age is
   found to be positive with low magnitudes when barriers are either very
   low or considerably high in contrast to negative effects when barriers
   are at moderate levels. A positive influence of the industrial
   affiliation at all barrier levels is also identified. Previous
   experience with flash flooding events as well as the effect of
   profitability are found to have negative impact in most levels of
   analysis. The assessment highlights the need for targeted intervention

Abstract = {{The flood risks are crucially increasing in developing countries around
   the globe due to intense development activities and climate change. The
   extreme casualties and losses wrought by the flood events in June 2013
   in the Uttarakhand (India) have raised the governance issues in
   policy-making and implementation for controlling human activities.
   Besides extreme rainfall, the unplanned development, weak legal
   framework and governance issues were claimed as responsible for
   triggering the disaster. The present study has evaluated the
   environmental aspects of existing policies related to regulate land use
   change and development activities when considered in relation to
   flooding. Analyzing the governance perspective by addressing policy,
   guidelines and mitigation strategies, this study highlighted the gaps in
   policies and practice that could be reshaped to reinforce resilience.
   This study also tried to delineate the high flood level and flood risk
   area along the Bhagirathi river using hydrological and hydrodynamic
   models for the event of 2013 that can assist in policy-making process.
   In summary, the study found that rampant construction at riverside in
   absence of effective building regulations and hydropower policy in the
   state has increased the magnitude of the disaster. The lack of
   multi-institutional coordination in formulating and practice of
   regulatory measures was found as a failure of governance in disaster
   preparedness and flood management. This study strongly suggests for
   compliance of local planning authorities and stakeholders with state and
   national policymakers for establishing collaborative governance. This
   article may help to bridge the gap between administrators and researcher
   for formulizing effective flood risk governance.}},

Abstract = {{Pakistan is prone to natural hazards including floods, in particular,
   affecting millions of people each year across the country. Patterns from
   recent years suggest the intensity of flooding are increasing and may
   continue more aggressively during the coming years because of increased
   magnitude of the monsoon rains and identified climatic changes in the
   region. Mapping of flood hazard is essential for planning and mitigation
   purpose. However, only flood hazard mapping is not sufficient to assess
   the magnitude of risk to lives and property. Risk mapping is an integral
   part of pre and post disaster management. Furthermore, the Earth
   Observation (EO) data could be helpful to update flood risk maps time to
   time by covering many aspects e.g. population concentration areas,
   critical infrastructure and commercial areas, to enhance the
   preparedness planning and mitigation measure against risk of flood.
   Pakistan has experienced the devastating flood in 2010 due to unexpected
   heavy rainfall in the monsoon season with enormous losses to property
   lives and infrastructure in several districts. The Union council Agra,
   District Charsadda was among the affected most districts by riverine and
   flash floods. Additionally, growing population in flood plains is
   another threat to the district. However, to cope with this situation
   there is immense need to detect risk index to prevent further damages
   caused by such floods. This study aims to prepare the hazard,
   vulnerability and risk index for River Kabul and Swat catchment area of
   union council Agra, Charsadda. the flood risk was identified, and risk
   index maps were prepared by executing a methodology for assessing risk,
   based on the physical exposure of the flood hazard, vulnerability of
   people, and the exposure of critical assets to flood water. Explicitly,
   spatial flood risk index maps were produced with the help of analytical
   spatial modeling by considering the areas exposed to flood hazard,
   morphological characteristics and socio-economic indicators. The
   produced flood risk maps were verified through visual examination
   through 3D city flood maps. Results illustrate that the areas of higher
   flood risk overlapped with the areas of high flood hazard along with
   high population density and socio-economic exposure to vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{Landslide or the landmass movement is a geomorphic hill slope physical
   process of mass-wasting resulting in downslope rolling of large mass of
   debris, regolith and soil under influence of gravity. It is caused by a
   combination of particular geo-factors that are region or territory
   specific. Landslides are generally triggered and activated by
   substantial precipitation and/or earthquake tremors and other
   anthropogenic interventions such as over the top cutting of slant for
   development of mountainous roads/streets and other excavations for civil
   structures, etc. The relatively young entire Himalayan hilly tract,
   mountainous steep slopes in sub-Himalayan landscape of North-east India,
   Western Ghats, the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu and Konkan ranges are
   susceptible to landslides or debris flow.
   In order to formulate strategies to minimize societal impacts of
   landslides, a systematic approach would entail preparation of Landslide
   Susceptibility Maps linked to landslide incidence inventory and making
   them available to the concerned stakeholders for necessary preparatory
   and mitigation measures. Geological Survey of India (GSI) being the
   nodal agency for landslides studies in India formally launched on
   February 05, 2014 the National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM)
   programme which has been a geoscientific exercise on 1: 50,000 scale on
   GIS platform in making both quantitative or qualitative estimates of
   spatial distribution of landslides which either exists or has the
   potential to occur in a given area. GSI has formulated a set of standard
   operating procedures that emphasize on geo-parametric data collection
   (as per standard and devised formats) for landslide inventory. These
   data sets are synthesized with relevant spatially-distributed causative
   thematic maps into susceptibility zonation which represents geospatial
   information indicating intensity and propensity of landslides. Such
   baseline data will ultimately lead to the collation and evaluation of
   landslide hazard and risk and mitigation plans. It will also help in
   disaster preparedness of the country and to indicate areas critical for
   landslide monitoring and developing early warning system (EWS).
   It is aimed to demarcate and facilitate prioritization of areas for
   further detailed studies (Meso- and Micro-scales) and help in Regional
   Land Use Planning and provide the scientific basis for framing the Land
   Use Zoning Regulations. Several lessons were learnt from Uttarakhand
   disaster of June 2013 in India that compelled re-evaluation of the
   existing methodology of conducting geosurveys of macro scale landslide
   susceptibility maps. Additional geofactors that also need to be
   considered include: effect of toe erosion by higher order streams;
   effect of long runouts of the debris flows and drainage morphometry;
   nature and size of clastic components, etc. It is intended to elaborate
   here a synthesis of various approaches and constraints on continuing
   research on such country-wide programmes on landslides related
   geohazards characterization and its implications on evolving EWS for the

   However, any method of predicting landslide susceptibility needs
   validation which sometimes may be difficult in areas having no land
   sliding history. Besides, EWS need also to highlight mitigation
   efforts/remedial measures through geotechnical and engineering solutions
   as suited to Indian conditions on case to case basis, delineation of
   safe escape routes in the event of a landslide/debris flow/flash floods,
   and for optimum utilization of available resources.}},

   Morogoro on January 11, 2018}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{Floods are the leading cause of hydrometeorological disasters in East
   Africa. Regardless of where, when, and how the event has happened,
   floods affect social security as well as environmental damages.
   Understanding floods dynamics, their impacts, and management is thus
   critical, especially in climate risk assessment. In the present study, a
   flash flood (a case of an episodic hydrological event) which happened on
   January 11, 2018, in Morogoro, Tanzania, is examined and synthesized.
   Data were courtesy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration Global Forecasting System (NOAA GFS) (forecast data),
   Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), and Sokoine University of
   Agriculture (for the automatic weather data). With the help of
   ZyGRIB-grib file visualization software (version 8.01, under General
   Public License (GNU GPL v3)), the forecast data and patterns of the
   observation from the automatic weather station (temperatures, wind speed
   and directions, rainfall, humidity, and pressure) and the long-term
   rainfall data analysis in the study area made it possible. This study
   contributes to the knowledge of understanding the changing weather for
   planning and management purposes. Both forecasts and the observations
   captured the flash flood event. The rain was in the category of heavy
   rainfall (more than 50mm per day) as per the regional guidelines. The
   synergy between the forecasts and the 30-minute weather observation
   interval captured the fundamental weather patterns that describe the
   event. For studying the nature and impacts of flash floods in the
   region, the integration of automatic weather observation into the
   systems of national meteorological centers is inevitable. Additionally,
   as part of an integrated disaster risk reduction effort, there is a need
   for a review on catchment management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Located in the tropics, the Republic of Mauritius is exposed to a number
   of natural disasters such as cyclones and torrential rains commonly
   causing flash floods. The World Risk report 2016 ranked Mauritius 7th on
   the list of countries that are more exposed to natural hazards. Early
   warning systems (EWS) are recognized in both the Hyogo Framework for
   Disaster Reduction (2005-2015) and the Sendai Framework for Disaster
   Risk Reduction (2015-2030) as an important element of disaster risk
   reduction. When disasters strike, first responders need to understand
   new situations on the ground. They require timely, validated information
   that can be integrated into information products for efficient
   communication, situational understanding, and ultimately for better
   decision-making. Communication technology play an important role in
   disaster management, especially in the preparedness phase. This study
   assesses the status of EWS of floods in Mauritius, key gaps and
   challenges, and will propose a framework for a people centered early
   warning system using big data for flash floods in the country. The study
   is useful to professionals and policy makers involved in disaster
   management at all levels in applying early warning information for use
   in disaster management and mitigation. Currently, real time warning does
   not exist for flash floods in Mauritius. This research would be
   significant in enhancing awareness about incorporating big data
   generated from mobile phones for real time evaluation of the situation
   and importance of spatial data infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{The storm water management approach is still scarce in developing
   countries. Streetscape is one of the city's elements that suitable for
   storm water management because of the dominance of impervious surface.
   Storm water runoff will cause damage of streetscape facility and river
   biodiversity in the long term due to the pollutant consist on it. This
   study focuses on the use of hydrological analysis to determine the main
   problem regarding the drainage capacity and the design solution with
   storm water management approach The case study takes place in Sudirman
   Street, Bogor City. There are two types of drainage basins in Sudirman
   Street and delineated to two different catchment areas. The result of
   study shows that both of existing channels have enough capability to
   accommodate peak runoff until 5-year storm, yet the flash flood still
   occurs during the heavy rain. This is leading to conclusion that the
   existing inflow design is not effective to convey the runoff into
   existing drainage. So, the design solution is utilizing green area in
   the streetscape as a green infrastructure that give a multiple benefit
   to the environment such as filter, infiltrate, and convey storm water
   runoff slowly to the main drainage.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are among the most devastating natural hazards but the
   analyses of flash floods are hindered by the lack of
   hydro-meteorological data. In particular, data issues are critical in
   ungauged basins. This paper presents an investigation of flash flood
   modeling using coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models.
   Specifically, the TOPography-based hydrological MODEL (TOPMODEL) is
   employed to obtain the flood hydrograph and the coupled 1D-2D
   hydrodynamic model MIKEFLOOD is used to simulate floodplain inundation.
   The methods are tested in the Pajiang River, a mountainous basin in
   South China. The results show that the TOPMODEL effectively simulates
   the flood hydrograph and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of the flow
   rate are larger than 0.80 for both calibration and validation. Also,
   MIKEFLOOD effectively simulates the flood inundation extent and flooding
   depth and the BIAS for simulated water level is - 0.004 m. Further,
   using socioeconomic and historical flood disaster datasets, areas with
   high flash flood risk are identified. A flash flood risk assessment
   shows a clear trend of change in the flood hazard and the spatial
   heterogeneity of the flood vulnerability is significant. A sensitivity
   analysis of the flood vulnerability to the socioeconomic indicators
   indicates that cultivated land is the most sensitive indicators, and the
   population and the construction areas have similar influences. Overall,
   the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models prove effective and can
   be used in practical applications for flash flood risk mapping.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, continuous improvements have been made in weather
   forecasting and flood prediction with great benefit from Early Warning
   Systems (EWSs). Despite the continuous quest for innovation from the
   scientific and user communities, EWSs remain based mostly on hazard
   forecast, and the information on possible consequences and potential
   impacts is generally missing.
   In this work, a methodology for quantitative real-time impact assessment
   for flash floods is presented. The methodology uses a multi-model
   ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty. Moreover, the
   flood forecasting chain, which normally provides only the discharge
   probability of exceeding a given threshold, is extended to include a
   fully 2D hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively
   assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved.
   The procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in Genoa in
   northwestern Italy. This paper discusses the potential challenges and
   opportunities offered by this approach in the decision-making workflow
   in an operational context.}},

Abstract = {{At a global level, the last 20 years have been characterized by the
   occurrence of extreme meteorological phenomena, which have directly
   determined extreme hydrological events. The appearance of these

   year. In the hydrographic basin of the Ozana river, the settlements are
   located exclusively on the valley of the river and its' main
   tributaries, and their territorial extent frequently overlaps the
   floodplain. The current study emphasizes the identification of the land
   use categories, inside the built-up area of each village along the Ozana
   river valley, and their classification, according to economic losses
   that can be generated during a flash flood. Also, the 0.1\% occurrence
   flood extent has been integrated into the analysis. The final results
   also reveal the regions inside the built-up areas, which have the

Abstract = {{Flash flood occurred on March 20, 2018, in Jatihandap, Bandung City,
   West Java due to the overflow of Cipamokolan River. This has caused
   considerable losses, especially for people living in the area. The flood
   occurred due to high rainfall intensity and inadequate land covering,
   especially in the upstream area (North Bandung Region) where the area is
   filled with housing, villas, and open land. Consequently, the water
   catchment area decreases. The objective of this study is to identify
   flood discharge that occurs due to high rainfall intensity and land
   covering. Flood discharge is calculated using a rational method. Based
   on BMKG data, rain intensity on March 20, 2018, is 45 mm/hour. The
   results of this study show that with this intensity, the Cipamokolan
   River flow brings water with sediment and debris waste. The discharge of
   the river is 207 m3/s. It equals to 2.2 times river basin discharge and
   causing water to overflow into the land around the river. The debris
   flow also damage the levees in Jatihandap then it caused flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{Oman witnessed exposure to various cyclones during the last decade
   including Gonu (2007), Phet (2010), Keila (2015; Dhofar), and Mekunu
   (2018; Dhofar). The purpose of this study is to assess flood damage due
   to flash wadi (dry river bed) flooding in Dhofar under present and
   future sea level conditions. This study uses a 3Di hydrodynamic model
   and a damage model to quantify the flood extent and flood damage due to
   the 2002 cyclonic storm (ARB01) and to identify vulnerable
   infrastructure in two watersheds: Zayk and Ghadow. The impact of the
   storm is assessed under present day and predicted 1.41 m sea level rise
   (SLR) conditions. The results show that with present sea level
   conditions the residential damage was estimated at US\$ 10.79M and US\$
   32.98M for Zayk and Ghadow respectively. Under a 1.41 m SLR scenario,
   the residential damage is projected to increase to US\$ 13.65M (26.5\%)
   and US\$ 40.28M (22.1\%) for Zayk and Ghadow respectively under a
   similar cyclonic storm event. These results provide knowledge to make
   informed policy decisions that contribute to the development of
   resilient infrastructure. It also provides a flood damage assessment of
   a potential future to prepare Oman for challenges under sea level rise.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last three decades, there has been a growing recognition of the
   need to ensure that the design and management of the built environment
   is sensitive to minimizing disturbance to natural hydrology and the
   water quality of the receiving environments. The practice of water
   sensitive urban design (WSUD) has emerged along with a number of other
   approaches to mitigate risks such as flash flooding, pollution of fresh
   and marine receiving waters, and water scarcity. The drivers for
   adopting WSUD practices, and the approaches used, depend on the specific
   context. Practices have continued to evolve and be refined, which has in
   large part been due to lessons learnt from pioneering developments that
   trialled innovative WSUD approaches. The cases reviewed in this chapter
   discuss some examples of leading-edge WSUD approaches that have provided
   the practical demonstration of the challenges and benefits to
   implementing WSUD. They can be used not only to refine standards and
   guidelines but also to build confidence in the WSUD approaches. A
   synthesis of findings from the case studies revealed the importance of
   WSUD being integrated across different urban functions, stakeholders,
   and levels of government. It is also shown that the benefits of WSUD
   often extend beyond the primary objective of improved urban stormwater
   management, reflecting the multifunctional nature of many WSUD
   approaches. These co-benefits often help to build public understanding
   and engagement in the benefits of WSUD. The cases also identified the
   importance of using economic instruments that reflect the true cost of
   different stormwater management approaches, which in turn can create the
   financial incentives for the adoption of WSUD approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Event detection is essential for decision makers to understand the
   events surrounding their real world. Social media microblogging
   platforms play a significant role in our life. One of these platforms is
   Twitter, which has an extreme high exchange rate and accordingly has
   become a valuable and relevant source for many political and social
   events. Event detection from social media attracted the attention of
   researchers in different natural languages. Extracting and detecting
   events from Arabic tweets is still under investigation. In this paper,
   we have used the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to
   develop two classifiers for filtering and detecting extracted events
   from Arabic tweets. The first classifier filters the collected tweets
   using two passes. The first pass identifies the hashtags while the
   second pass does a shallow analysis on the tweets content. The second
   classifier analyzes the text extracted from the tweets. As a case study,
   we present the tragic events of the Jordan flash floods near the Dead
   Sea. The model successfully filtered all the collected tweets and picked
   the ones describing the incidents within that region. Analyzed data
   revealed important information to learn from this lesson for the future.
   The solution can be generalized and adapted to other problems.}},

Abstract = {{The early-warning model for flash floods is based on a hydrological and
   geomorphological concept connected to the river basin, with the
   principle that flash floods will only occur where there is a high
   potential risk and when rainfall exceeds the threshold. In the model
   used to build flash-floods risk maps, the parameters of the basin are
   analyzed and evaluated and the weight is determined using Thomas Saaty's
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The flash-floods early-warning
   software is built using open source programming tools. With the spatial
   module and online processing, a predicted precipitation of one to six
   days in advance for iMETOS (AgriMediaVietnam) automatic meteorological
   stations is interpolated and then processed with the potential risk maps
   (iMETOS is a weather-environment monitoring system comprising a wide
   range of equipment and an online platform and can be used in various
   fields such as agriculture, tourism and services). The results determine
   the locations of flash floods at several risk levels corresponding to
   the predicted rainfall values at the meteorological stations. The system
   was constructed and applied to flash floods disaster early warning for
   Thuan Chau in Son La province when the rainfall exceeded the 150 mm/d
   threshold. The system initially supported positive decision-making to
   prevent and minimize damage caused by flash floods.}},

Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Floods have been severely threatening social development worldwide. The
   occurrence of floods has multiple factors, and the flood risk
   considering road environments needs comprehensive analysis from
   meteorology, underlying surface, and urban road network. Thus, this
   study proposes an integrated method and constructs a road risk zoning
   model (RRZM). In the RRZM, submerged depth was obtained by the Soil
   Conservation Service (SCS) model, and the degree of road importance was
   obtained by the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. These two
   parts were used to characterize road vulnerability. Then the flood risk
   grade was evaluated based on the optimized artificial neural network
   (ANN). Finally, the results of flood risk assessment were obtained by
   road vulnerability and flood risk grade. The RRZM was applied to the
   Chang-Zhu-Tan Urban Agglomeration (CZTUA), China. The results showed
   that the spatial distributions of flood risk and the extent of road
   damage varied remarkably in different cities. Changsha was the most
   sensitive city to floods in the CZTUA. The flood risk zones were
   classified into six levels, and the vulnerable road sections identified
   from the risk zones at level 6 in the maps carried more traffic volume
   than others. By comparing with existing methods, it was found that the
   RRZM effectively reflected the spatial characteristics of flood risk
   considering road environments. It provides a new perspective for urban
   flood risk assessment and disaster response decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are one of the most serious natural disasters, and have a
   significant impact on economic development. In this study, we employed
   the spatiotemporal analysis method to measure the spatial-temporal
   distribution of flash floods and examined the relationship between flash
   floods and driving factors in different subregions of landcover.
   Furthermore, we analyzed the response of flash floods on the economic
   development by sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that the
   number of flash floods occurring annually increased gradually from 1949
   to 2015, and regions with a high quantity of flash floods were
   concentrated in Zhaotong, Qujing, Kunming, Yuxi, Chuxiong, Dali, and
   Baoshan. Specifically, precipitation and elevation had a more
   significant effect on flash floods in the settlement than in other
   subregions, with a high r (Pearson's correlation coefficient) value of
   0.675, 0.674, 0.593, 0.519, and 0.395 for the 10 min precipitation in
   20-year return period, elevation, 60 min precipitation in 20-year return
   period, 24 h precipitation in 20-year return period, and 6 h
   precipitation in 20-year return period, respectively. The sensitivity
   analysis showed that the Kunming had the highest sensitivity (S = 21.86)
   during 2000-2005. Based on the research results, we should focus on
   heavy precipitation events for flash flood prevention and forecasting in
   the short term; but human activities and ecosystem vulnerability should
   be controlled over the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Devastating floods in southeast Queensland in 2011 were the combination
   of flash flooding in the Lockyer Valley with riverine flooding in the
   Brisbane metropolitan area. While there is considerable information
   about the immediate impact on those affected, there is less
   understanding of the long-term health effects that follow such events.
   This study explored the perceptions of health effects and support
   received by people affected by the 2011 southeast Queensland flood six
   years after the event. A cross-sectional survey of 327 people was
   conducted in areas affected by the floods. The questionnaire sought
   information about the ongoing social, economic, demographic and
   self-declared physical and mental health effects. The data were analysed
   through comparison of those unaffected with those directly affected by
   the floods. Residents whose households were flooded were more likely to
   score their health negatively than non-affected residents and had higher
   reported rates of trauma, injury and mental illness. Twenty-six per cent
   of this group reported that they still experience some adverse health
   effects from the floods. Managing the longterm health implications of a
   flood-affected population is an important public policy task.
   Dissatisfaction with recovery operations and perceived injustices
   associated with insurance and compensation arrangements may aggravate

   search for a solution related to this problematic issue has become the
   starting point of the research. Noteworthy factors that increase the
   risk of flooding in Turkey include the effects of global climate change,
   increasing number of urban areas, changes in landscape, wrong land use
   decisions, spatial planning approaches disregarding natural thresholds
   and the phenomenon of natural risk. In this context, spatial planning
   approaches are needed to reinforce settlements against flooding
   disasters and ensure sustainability.
   In this study, international conferences and approaches of developed

   The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the key to success in
   all efforts to prevent damages to property caused by floods in Turkey is
   ``the need for ensuring integration of such efforts with spatial

Abstract = {{Natural hazards are indeed counted as the most critical challenges
   facing our world, represented in floods, earthquakes, volcanoes,

   photos captured by using a helicopter. This paper aims at three prime
   objectives. Firstly, the flood influence is determined on the city of
   Ras Ghareb, Egypt, based on analyzing free satellite data (Sentinel-2
   images). Secondly, fuzzy the analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method
   and a geographical information system (GIS) are integrated for flood
   risk analysis and evaluation in the flood-prone area. Finally, such a
   flood vulnerability map is used as an index to assist the
   decision-makers prepare for probable flooding. FAHP is preferable as it
   can cater to the uncertainties in data and analysis. As a result, FAHP
   is appropriate to determine the flood-vulnerable area in cities
   especially due to the matching with the most destroyed areas identified
   by the change detection between the two Sentinel-2 images. Then, the
   decision-maker can depend on Sentinel-2 images to estimate the flood
   influence through a regional scale or applying the FAHP on cities
   susceptible to flash floods in case of unavailable satellite images to
   contribute in establishing an early warning system enough to the
   evacuation of the risky areas.}},

Abstract = {{In 2010, flash floods triggered by Hurricane Alex caused fifteen
   fatalities in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA). In contrast, an
   estimated 225 people died in the 1988 Hurricane Gilbert disaster and
   reputedly, over 5,000 in the historical flood of 1909. The magnitude of
   hurricane-related impacts thus appears to be decreasing, indicating
   higher resilience to this hazard. This paper analyses the process of
   building resilience to flash floods in the MMA over the last several
   decades. Knowledge co-production plays a significant role in that
   process, particularly through the Nuevo Leon State Reconstruction
   Council, the multi-institutional, public-private-civil group of
   stakeholders established to guide and coordinate reconstruction efforts
   following the Hurricane Alex disaster. Findings reveal a complex,
   protracted and incremental resilience building process, conditioned by
   the nature of the hazard (infrequent but liable to cause significant
   damages) and contingent upon the city's socioeconomic and institutional
   local context. This local context is embedded in a highly fragmented
   national water governance architecture that lacks inter-institutional
   co-ordination and has limited the city's adaptive responses. Despite
   definite gains in building resilience, the city faces challenges notably
   in terms of the conservation and continuing development of knowledge
   co-produced in the aftermath of disasters.}},

Abstract = {{Despite massive flood protection efforts in China, undertaken since the
   ancient times, disastrous floods continue to plague the country. In this
   paper, we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in China.
   First, we review published results (including our own works) on change
   detection in observed records of intense precipitation, high river flow
   and flood damage in China. We provide information on essential features
   of extreme floods in last decades - floods on large rivers, urban
   floods, and flash floods. Next, we review available projections for the
   future (including our own results), related to intense precipitation,
   high river flow and flood damage in China. We try to interpret the
   difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications.
   Since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large, projections
   have to be interpreted with caution, because of the impact on decisions
   related to climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, and water
   resources management. We review flood risk reduction strategies in
   China, focusing on the present situation and division of
   responsibilities. China has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task
   to improve flood preparedness, by both structural ({''}hard{''})
   defences, such as: dikes, dams and flood control reservoirs, and
   diversions, as well as non-structural ({''}soft{''}) measures: spatial
   planning and zoning; watershed management (source control), flood
   forecasting and warning systems; and awareness raising. The strategy of
   flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to
   alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding.}},

Abstract = {{St. Vincent and the Grenadines is an archipelagic state of the Caribbean
   that regularly suffers natural disasters; climate change is increasing
   the frequency of intense hurricanes and storms. The southernmost
   watersheds of St. Vincent have a rugged topography that favours
   flash-flooding in rainy events, with great damage because the area
   concentrates most of the country's population and infrastructure. To
   deal with this problem the Government has developed studies, engineering
   works and a watershed management plan. Land use management is an
   effective way of controlling hydrological impacts; the plan divides the
   watersheds in three uses, nature conservation (46\%), agriculture and
   agroforestry (24\%), and urban (30\%), with categories, establishing
   permitted, prohibited and restricted activities. The area is close to
   the limit of urban development; if further expansion were essential it
   should be done by increasing density in lower and flatter areas. Many
   houses, usually low-income settlements, are in flooding or landslide
   risk areas, which should be decolonized, changing land use. It is also
   necessary to avoid hillside arable crops. Adaptation to climate change
   through land use management is essential, although unfortunately less
   socially and politically appreciated than engineering works.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the trends in economic damages caused by three
   types of inland floods (flash flood, flood, and heavy rain) in the
   United States and the variations in related hazard and vulnerability
   indicators between 1996 and 2016. We explore the underlying mechanisms
   based on a survey-based dataset maintained by the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service. An annual
   average of 6518 flood occurrences was reported, which caused economic
   damages of 3351 million USD per year. Flash flood and flood contributed
   to 53\% and 32\% of total occurrences and was associated with a larger
   share of damaging events (SDE). Results show that the higher impacts by
   flood and flash flood on property and crop are partly attributed to the
   greater intensity of rainfall. In addition, flood has the highest unit
   cost of damages. Notably, despite an upward tendency in economic damages
   by flash floods, no evident change trend is observed for inland floods
   as a whole. Further analysis shows changes in economic damages by heavy
   rain and flash flood are mainly governed by the increased annual
   frequency and hazard intensity, but the change of trend in their
   vulnerability indicators (i.e., SDE and Damage Per Event (DPE)) is not
   obvious. Regarding floods, it was not possible to attribute the
   variations in economic losses to hazard and vulnerability, as no
   significant tendency is found except for an increasing SDE. Despite
   limitations of length of records, data collection, and methodology, the
   difference in economic impacts and the related hazard and vulnerability
   revealed in this study can help better target future adaptation and
   mitigation measures.}},

   2000-2015}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{38}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Extreme hydrological events such as flash floods are likely to become
   more frequent and extreme because of increasingly extreme weather and
   climate events. Flash floods occur particularly frequently in China and
   cause huge losses to society annually. Consequently, the Chinese
   government significantly increased the investments in comprehensive
   flash flood disaster prevention and mitigation systems. These measures
   (implemented in 2000-2015) played a pivotal role in reducing flash flood
   fatalities. The absolute annual death toll and average fatality rate in
   single torrential rainstorms in 2008-2015 decreased by 40\% and 42\%
   with the massively increased investments compared with those of previous
   years, respectively. However, the efficiency of fiscal investment in
   reducing flash flood fatalities has not been optimal at the national and
   provincial scales in most years. The technical inefficiency of the
   recent eight years was mainly influenced by the scale inefficiency at
   the national scale; by contrast, the technical inefficiency of the most
   recent years depended largely on pure technical efficiency (PTE) on a
   provincial scale. This implies that fiscal investment should be
   allocated more reasonably through dynamic risk assessment at the
   national level, and the selection of prevention measures must place more
   emphasis on rationality and effectiveness in different areas. PTE at a
   regional scale should be increased by solving the limitations of
   existing measures. Hence, rigorous analyses are necessary. The results
   of this study offer a different perspective on flash flood disaster
   prevention systems and can be used to compare flood risk management
   method to those of other countries.}},

   Assessment and Mapping in China}},
Journal = {{ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods are one of the natural disasters that threaten the lives of
   many people all over the world every year. Flash floods are
   significantly affected by the intensification of extreme climate events
   and interactions with exposed and vulnerable socio-economic systems
   impede regional development processes. Hence, it is important to
   estimate the loss due to flash floods before the disaster occurs.
   However, there are no comprehensive vulnerability assessment results for
   flash floods in China. Fortunately, the National Mountain Flood Disaster
   Investigation Project provided a foundation to develop this proposed
   assessment. In this study, an index system was established from the
   exposure and disaster reduction capability categories, and is based on
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods. We evaluated flash flood
   vulnerability by adopting the support vector machine (SVM) model. Our
   results showed 439 counties with high and extremely high vulnerability
   (accounting for 10.5\% of the land area and corresponding to
   approximately 100 million hectares (ha)), 571 counties with moderate
   vulnerability (accounting for 19.18\% of the land area and corresponding
   to approximately 180 million ha), and 1128 counties with low and
   extremely low vulnerability (accounting for 39.43\% of the land area and
   corresponding to approximately 370 million ha). The highly-vulnerable
   counties were mainly concentrated in the south and southeast regions of
   China, moderately-vulnerable counties were primarily concentrated in the
   central, northern, and southwestern regions of China, and
   low-vulnerability counties chiefly occurred in the northwest regions of
   China. Additionally, the results of the spatial autocorrelation
   suggested that the ``High-High{''} values of spatial agglomeration areas
   mainly occurred in the Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi,
   Chongqing, and Beijing areas. On the basis of these results, our study
   can be used as a proposal for population and building distribution
   readjustments, and the management of flash floods in China.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Bangladesh remains one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to
   the effects of climate change. Given the reliance of a large segment of
   the population on the agricultural sector for both their livelihoods as
   well as national food security, climate change adaptation in the
   agricultural sector is crucial for continued national food security and
   economic growth. Using household data from lowland rice farmers of
   selected haor areas in Sylhet, the current work presents an analysis of
   the determinants behind the implementation of different climate change
   adaptation strategies by lowland rice farmers. The first objective of
   this study was to explore the extent of awareness of climate change
   within this population as well as the type of opinions held by lowland
   rice farmers with respect to climate change. To serve this purpose, a
   severity index (SI) was developed and subsequently employed to evaluate
   the perceptions and attitudes of 378 farmers with respect to climate
   change vulnerability. Respondents were interviewed with respect to
   climate change related circumstances they faced in their daily lives.
   Attained SI index values ranged from 69.18\% to 93.52\%. The SI for the
   perception ``Climate change affects rice production{''} was measured as
   93.52\%. Using data collected from the same 378 farmers, a logistic
   regression was carried out to investigate the impact of socio-economic
   and institutional factors on adaptation. The results show that credit
   from non-government organizations is highly statistically significant
   for adaptation, and that rural market structure also has a positive
   effect on adaptation. Among the studied factors, credit from
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) was found to be the most important
   factor for adaptation. The results of this work further indicate that
   marginal farmers would benefit from government (GoB) funded seasonal
   training activities that cover pertinent information regarding
   adaptation after flash floods. Additionally, the authors of this piece
   recommend timely issuance of government-assisted credit during early
   flash floods to afflicted farmers, as such an initiative can aid farmers
   in adapting different strategies to mitigate losses and enhance their
   productivity as well as livelihood.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we developed an enhanced approach for large-scale flood

   an aggregated land-use category to represent the exposure, treating all
   exposed elements the same. For large areas where previously only coarse
   information existed such as in Africa, more detailed exposure data are
   becoming available. For our approach, a direct relation between the
   construction type and building material of the exposed elements is used
   to develop vulnerability curves. We further present a method to
   differentiate flood risk in urban and rural areas based on
   characteristics of the built environment. We applied the model to
   Ethiopia and found that rural flood risk accounts for about 22\% of
   simulated damage; rural damage is generally neglected in the typical
   land-use-based damage models, particularly at this scale. Our approach
   is particularly interesting for studies in areas where there is a large

   effectively reduced by using SUD systems which incorporate vegetated
   surfaces that absorbs and retains rain water, purifies stormwater and

   heat, thereby reducing the incidence of flash floods and heat islands.
   SUD system is recommended as a viable method of heat and flood control
   in cities as cities using SUDS were found to cope very well with heat
   and floods. Overall, technical measures of flood management such as SUDS

Abstract = {{The rainfall threshold assessment of flash floods normally determines
   the rationality of a single warning duration for a disaster prevention

Title = {{Is there any chance for the poor to cope with extreme environmental

Abstract = {{Our paper analyses the patterns and factors that explain households'
   responses to extreme environmental events (EEEs) in two case studies of
   indigenous communities in the Solomon Islands. We used the ethnographic
   approach to describe the case studies and carried out thematic analysis
   to disentangle the factors that explain such responses. The first case
   was that of a rural community from Ranogha Island in the Western
   Province that was hit by the Tsunami of April 2007; the second was of a
   community settled in an informal development on a flood-prone area in
   peri-urban Honiara that was hit by a flash flood in April 2014. Drawing
   from the villagers' experiences, we found that aid and support from
   family and community, referred to by the respondents as the ``wantok{''}
   system, was key to recovering from the disasters. Many respondents
   identified climate change as one leading factor that explained such
   catastrophic events. The social cooperation system, the government's
   role in responding to catastrophes and household net worth were
   identified among the main components of household responses. These
   constitute an effective engine to build palliative and preventive
   responses against catastrophic events and climate change risks. In spite
   of the extreme poverty observed, and the lack of government assistance,
   we conclude that amenities obtained from the community (through the
   wantok system) and household net worth (including the availability of
   common pool resources) enabled them to cope with the catastrophes. These
   factors are critical for long-term adaptation to EEEs and climate change
   risks. The community responses analysed with thematic analysis showed to
   be consistent with the conceptualization led by a farm-household model,
   and the household net worth as a source of income appears to be the
   correct measure of wealth instead the level of income in these less
   monetarised communities. Learning from how these communities and
   households responded to such EEEs provides evidence on how other
   communities could successfully adapt to increasing climate change risks.

Abstract = {{Extreme hydrometeorological events such as hurricanes and cyclones are
   increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change and often
   associated with flash floods in coastal, urbanized and industrial areas.
   Preparedness and response measures need to concentrate on toxicological
   and infectious hazards, the potential impact on environmental health,
   and threat to human lives. The recognition of the danger of flood water
   after hurricanes is critical. Effective health management needs to
   consider the likelihood and specific risks of toxic agents present in
   waters contaminated by chemical spills, bio-toxins, waste, sewage, and
   water-borne pathogens. Despite significant progress in the ability to
   rapidly detect and test water for a wide range of chemicals and
   pathogens, there has been a lack of implementation to adapt toxicity
   measurements in the context of flash and hurricane-induced flooding. The
   aim of this review was to highlight the need to collect and analyze data
   on toxicity of flood waters to understand the risks and prepare
   vulnerable communities and first responders. It is proposed that new and
   routinely used technologies be employed during disaster response to
   rapidly assess toxicity and infectious disease threats, and subsequently
   take necessary remedial actions.}},

Volume = {{158}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods in Egypt are considered frequent meteorological natural
   hazards. Qena is one of the most Egyptian governorates prone to flash
   floods. Various flash floods events hit Qena from 1954 till 2016. Flash
   floods occurred in Qena on 28th October 2016 inundated houses and roads,
   generated losses in lives, damages to private and public property. The
   intensive rainfall coupled with the rapid urban expansion in Qena and
   along the Nile Valley could worsen the situation. Despite, the
   destructive impacts of the flash floods in Qena, flash floods can be
   used as a valuable source of fresh water as the study area is classified
   as an arid zone and characterized with the fresh-water shortage.
   Integration of remotely sensed data with the Analytical Hierarchy
   Process and Geographic Information Systems spatial modeling presented
   valuable analysis techniques in this study. The present study focused on
   mapping the spatial distribution of flash floods vulnerability in Qena's
   urban areas. Ten indicators were used to analyze the flood floods
   namely; rainfall, soil, geology, slope, elevation, flow direction,
   drainage network, land cover, total population, and population density.
   The results revealed that Qena, Qus, Naqadah, and Dishna urban districts
   are the most vulnerable to flash floods and located in the very high
   zone with 25.3\%, 14.9\%, 12.3\%, and 9.8\% respectively. The total
   population situated at very high and high vulnerability zone reached
   represents 7.66\% and 43.36\% of the total population. The obtained
   results considered crucial information for decision-makers for future
   effective flash floods hazards mitigation, assessment management,
   planning, and sustainable development.}},

   Application to a Small Urban Stream in South Korea}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The runoff from heavy rainfall reaches urban streams quickly, causing
   them to rise rapidly. It is therefore of great importance to provide
   sufficient lead time for evacuation planning and decision making. An
   efficient flood forecasting and warning method is crucial for ensuring
   adequate lead time. With this objective, this paper proposes an analysis
   method for a flood forecasting and warning system, and establishes the
   criteria for issuing urban-stream flash flood warnings based on the
   amount of rainfall to allow sufficient lead time. The proposed
   methodology is a nonstructural approach to flood prediction and risk
   reduction. It considers water level fluctuations during a rainfall event
   and estimates the upstream (alert point) and downstream (confluence)
   water levels for water level analysis based on the rainfall intensity
   and duration. We also investigate the rainfall/runoff and flow
   rate/water level relationships using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's
   Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the HEC's River Analysis System
   (HEC-RAS) models, respectively, and estimate the rainfall threshold for
   issuing flash flood warnings depending on the backwater state based on
   actual watershed conditions. We present a methodology for issuing flash
   flood warnings at a critical point by considering the effects of
   fluctuations in various backwater conditions in real time, which will
   provide practical support for decision making by disaster protection
   workers. The results are compared with real-time water level
   observations of the Dorim Stream. Finally, we verify the validity of the
   flash flood warning criteria by comparing the predicted values with the
   observed values and performing validity analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are still a significant threat to people, despite of the
   considerable developments in forecasting, management, defensive, and

   (EUropean Flood Fatalities), which was built using documentary sources.
   The narratives of fatalities were investigated and standardized in the

   stable trend on flood fatalities, despite the existence of individual
   increasing (Greece, Italy, and South France) and decreasing (Turkey and
   Catalonia) trends. The 2466 fatalities were mainly males, aged between
   30-49 years and the majority of them happened outdoor. Most often people
   were dragged by water/mud when travelling by motor vehicles. Some cases
   of hazardous behaviors, such as fording rivers, were also detected. The
   primary cause of death was drowning, followed by heart attack. This work
   contributes to understand the human-flood interaction that caused

Abstract = {{Water problems arising from the negative effects of climate change will
   cause serious challenges to cities in the near future. Sudden, heavy
   rainfall in a short time as well as the summer drought periods can be a
   major concern for urban water management systems. In addition to
   overloading the urban sewer system, urban flash floods caused by large
   amounts of precipitation can lead to serious damage in connection with
   surface runoff; furthermore, this significant amount of water is removed
   from the water cycle of the city without utilization (infiltration,
   storage). Various water management and hydrology models, such as
   UFORE-Hydro used in our analyses, can serve as suitable tools for
   investigating these processes. In our research, we examined the role of
   vegetation covered areas in urban water cycle, paying special attention
   to their impact on surface runoff. The results of modeling in Szeged
   sample areas show that vegetation can considerably reduce the volume and
   amplitude of surface runoff. In the scenario studies, vegetation has
   always changed the rate of runoff in a favorable direction, thus our
   findings support the necessity of green infrastructure developments.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in past occurrences of flooding from
   intense rainfall, commonly referred to as ``flash flooding,{''} and the

   us to place recent events in context and to understand the effect of low

   Previous studies have focussed on fluvial flooding to reconstruct the

   flood chronology for the north and south-west of England for flash
   floods, including both surface water and fluvial flooding, with coverage
   from similar to 1700 to similar to 2013 (). The primary source of
   documentary material is local newspaper reports, which often give
   detailed descriptions of impacts. This provides a new resource to inform
   communities and first responders of flood risks, especially those from
   rapid rise in water level whose severity may be greater than those of
   accompanying peak flow. Examples are provided of historical flash floods
   that exemplify how the chronologies can help to place recent floods in
   the context of the preinstrumental record for: (a) more robust estimates
   of event return period, (b) identification of catchment or settlement
   susceptibility to flash flood events, and (c) characterisation of events

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{575}},
Pages = {{587-595}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Irrespective of the magnitude and spatial extend, the consequences of a
   natural hazard are strongly connected to the vulnerability of elements
   at risk (e.g. people, buildings and infrastructure). It is, therefore,
   obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required
   for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability
   assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as
   the socio-economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and
   coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is
   multidimensional (physical, social, economic, etc.), however, the
   dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to
   human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical
   vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in
   small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial
   sediment transport, debris floods, and debris flows. Furthermore, we
   included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential
   catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain
   areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the
   last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of
   buildings towards flash floods, debris flows and hyper-concentrated
   flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and
   approaches may be classified under the following three categories:
   vulnerability matrices, vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices.
   We provide a short review of these methods which became available over
   the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain
   hazard risk management, giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves. The
   approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from
   the European Alps and beyond. Furthermore, challenges in vulnerability
   assessment including data requirements, need for improved event
   documentation, uncertainties and challenges related to future climate
   and socio-economic changes are outlined. Finally, a discussion on
   progress-driving factors such as new technologies (e.g. mobile apps,
   drones), citizen science and new innovative assessment methods is
   provided.}},

   to main channel, drainage density, and land use cover. To decide the
   relative weight of the impact of each flood causative factors an
   Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was used. Accordingly, a composite

Abstract = {{This study aims to assess the impact of flash floods in the Wadi Nu'man
   basin on urban areas, east of Mecca, which are subjected to frequent
   floods, during the period from 1988-2019. By producing and analyzing the
   maps of the regions, an integrated approach to geomatics and hydraulic
   modelling is employed. The following maps are used: Flood-prone urbanity
   from 1988-2019, a flood risk map of Wadi Nu'man based on a risk matrix
   map, and a map of the proposed protection measures and alternatives in
   the study area. In order to achieve these goals, changes in the land use
   in the Wadi Nu'man basin were monitored by analyzing successive
   satellite images, taken by the US satellite, Landsat, in 1988, 1998,
   2013, and 2019. Using a supervised classification, with the maximum
   likelihood method of ERDAS IMAGINE 2016, GIS was used in the production
   and analysis of soil maps, and geological and hydrological groups of
   drainage basins, as well as the hydrological model (HEC-HMS), were
   applied in calculating the hydrograph curve of the Wadi Nu'man basin.
   The flood water volumes and flow rates were estimated based on the SCS
   unit hydrograph, and the rain depth was analyzed and estimated for
   different periods. The hydraulic modeling program (HEC-RAS) was
   employed, when developing a two-dimensional model to calculate the
   speed, depth, and spread of the flood, in order to apply the risk matrix
   method. The recommendations based on this study give priority to the
   implementation of a flood prevention plan and the protection of
   infrastructure by maintaining the existing flood drainage facilities and
   establishing new drainage facilities to protect lives, property, and

   approach}},
Journal = {{GEOJOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{The study examines the relationship between poverty and forest cover
   degradation in rural areas of Pakistan. The area selected for the study
   District Upper Dir is a rural and relatively backward region located in
   northwestern Pakistan, in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The study area is
   undergoing severe deforestation and natural disasters in the recent
   past. The study consists of two stages, in first stage the traditional
   Geographical information system image was used to analyze the
   spatial-temporal situation of the surroundings. In the second stage,
   well-designed questionnaire was used to collect the primary information
   from 420 randomly selected households of research areas. A
   multidimensional poverty index has been used to measure the poverty
   profile of the population. It has been found that 55\% households were
   below the poverty line. Almost, 95\% households are using wood for
   cooking purposes. High dependence on natural resources causes forest
   cover degradation while burning off too much wood causes CO2 emission
   and leads to environmental degradation. A major portion of population is
   living on steeply sloped areas with certain risks. It is found that
   frequency of flash flood is 53\% and agricultural land (54\%) is at high
   risk and often flows with flash floods. It is concluded that there is
   strong correlation between multidimensional poverty and forest cover
   degradation which leads to climate and environmental risks.}},

Title = {{The impact of intense rainfall on insurance losses in two Swedish cities}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{While a major part of previous research in the field of flood damage has
   focused on water depth as the most important causal factor, little
   attention has been paid to the role of rainfall intensity. As a test,
   this paper used correlation and regression analyses to investigate
   rainfall intensity as a factor affecting flood damage. For a time period
   of 15 years, the relationship between insurance losses caused by floods
   and rainfall intensity data from rain gauges was examined in two Swedish
   cities. Another objective was to find an approach for damage functions
   based on rainfall intensity as explanatory variable. Using linear
   regression, two approaches with considerable high degrees of explanation
   were found-one based on an exponential function and one on a power
   function. Using a lower limit for rainfall intensity, the approaches
   reached degrees of explanation between 30 and 78\%. From this study it
   was concluded that rainfall intensity during the summer months and the
   occurrence of insurance damages per day caused by floods were correlated
   and further that rainfall intensity has a great potential to explain
   urban flood damages. In the future, additional studies are needed to
   validate the proposed methods and integrate other flood damage affecting
   factors in the approach.}},

   coefficient and (ii) an iterative calculation of the spreading process.
   In addition, an equation is proposed to calculate the inundation around
   a metro station and to predict the potential inundation risks of the
   metro system. The proposed method is applied to simulate the inundation
   risk of the metro system in the urban centre of Shanghai under 50-year,
   100-year, and 500-year rainfall intensities. Both inundation extent and
   depth are obtained and the proposed method is validated with records of
   historical floods. The results demonstrate that in the case of a

Abstract = {{On December 2, 1959, the Malpasset arch dam in southeast France suddenly
   failed, flooding the valley down to the sea, causing huge destruction
   and more than 400 casualties. Built from 1952 to 1954 for water supply
   and irrigation, filling of the reservoir was delayed five years and the
   failure occurred following a flash flood of the river the dam was
   closing. Post failure studies and expertise during a trial revealed poor
   field investigations on a micaschist rock foundation crisscrossed by
   faults, and poor management of construction of the structure. The
   failure was ascribed to uplift, moving a rock dihedron defined by a
   conspicuous fault and a tear along foliation. This paper shows that, in
   addition to the many traps listed by previous investigations (mostly
   geological and geotechnical), the human and organizational factors can
   also shed a new light on this catastrophe. Keeping lessons from
   Malpasset alive and increasing the knowledge about this case is relevant
   since worldwide, after the catastrophe, not only did new regulations on
   dams appear but also both fields of geological engineering and rock
   mechanics were developed. Thus, consciously or not, every geological
   engineer or rock mechanics specialists is somehow, a descendant of this

Abstract = {{This paper presents the potential of documentary evidence for enhancing
   the study of fatalities taking place in the course of hydrological and

   HMEs (flood, flash flood, windstorm, convective storm, lightning, frost,
   snow/glaze-ice calamity, heat, and other events) in the 1981-2018 period
   is presented, with particular attention to closer characterisation of
   fatalities (gender, age, cause of death, place, type of death, and

   numbers of fatalities (severe frosts in the extremely cold winter of
   1928/1929, a flash flood on 9 June 1970, and a rain flood in July 1997)
   are described in detail. Discussion of results includes the problem of
   data uncertainty, factors influencing the numbers of fatalities, and the
   broader context. Since floods are responsible for the highest proportion
   of HME-related deaths, places with fatalities are located mainly around
   rivers and drowning appears as the main cause of death. In the further
   classification of fatalities, males and adults clearly prevail, while

Title = {{Mapping Flood-Related Mortality in the Mediterranean Basin. Results from
   the MEFF v2.0 DB}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recent events in Western Attica in Greece (24 deaths in November 2017),
   in the Balearic Islands (13 deaths in October 2018), and in southern
   France (15 deaths in October 2018) show that flood-related mortality
   remains a major concern in Mediterranean countries facing flash floods.
   Over the past several years, many initiatives have arisen to create
   databases on flood-related mortality. An international initiative
   started in 2011 pooling regional and national databases on flood
   mortality from region and/or countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.
   The MEditerranean Flood Fatality Database (MEFF DB) brings together, in
   2018, six Mediterranean regions/countries: Catalonia (Spain), Balearic
   Islands (Spain), Southern France, Calabria (Italy), Greece, and Turkey,
   and covers the period 1980-2018. MEFF DB is on progress and, every year,
   new data are included, but for this study, we kept only the preliminary
   data that were geolocated and validated on 31st of December 2018. This
   research introduces a new step in the analysis of flood-related
   mortality and follows the statistical description of the MEFF DB already
   published. The goals of this paper are to draw the spatial distribution
   of flood mortality through a geographical information system (GIS) at
   different spatial scales: country, NUTS 3 (Nomenclature of Territorial
   Units for Statistics. Level 3) regions, catchment areas, and grid. A
   fatality rate (F: number of deaths/year/million of inhabitants) is
   created to help this analysis. Then, we try to relate mortality to basic
   (human or physical) drivers such as population density, rainfall
   seasonality, or rainfall frequency across the Mediterranean Basin. The
   mapping of F shows a negative mortality gradient between the western and
   the eastern parts of the Mediterranean Sea. The south of France appears
   to be the most affected region. The maps also highlight the seasonality
   of flood-related deaths with the same west-east gradient. It confirms
   that flood mortality follows the climatological seasonal patterns across
   the Mediterranean Basin. Flood-related fatalities mainly occur during
   the early fall season in the western part of the Mediterranean area,
   while the Easter Basin is affected later, in November or during the
   winter season. Eastern Turkey introduces another pattern, as mortality
   is more severe in summer. Mortality maps are then compared with factors
   that potentially contribute to the occurrence of flood fatalities, such
   as precipitation intensity (rainfall hazard), to explain geographical
   differences in the fatality rate. The density of a fatal event is
   correlated to the population density and the rainfall frequency.
   Conversely, the average number of deaths per event depends on other
   factors such as prevention or crisis management.}},

   Northern Mountainous Regions of Vietnam}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{252}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Understanding household's decision making in agricultural production to
   natural hazards is significant for policymakers and extension
   organizations in supporting farmers to optimize adaptive strategies,
   there are, however, still limited empirical researches that emphasize
   the determinants affecting the choice of measures in the process of
   adaptation. This paper explores the decision-making process of rural
   households in adapting to flash floods and landslides (FF\&LS) by
   conducting a household survey on 405 purposively selected households in
   Yen Bai province, one of the poorest mountainous regions in Vietnam.
   Based on the multi-portfolio framework, the study assumes that farmers
   have multiple choice of adaptation strategies simultaneously and these
   adaptation measures are correlative. Multivariate Probit models were
   used to figure out the household decision making process in adapting to
   FF\&LS. Survey results showed that changing cropping patterns, crop
   variegation, diversifying types of crop varieties, as well as managing
   and implementing crop protection (soil and plant) are the primary
   adaptation measures applied by local farmers. Furthermore, lack of
   money, inadequate support from local government, shortage of machinery
   and technical equipment, as well as insufficient knowledge about FF\&LS
   were listed as major constraints in the study area. The MVP analysis
   indicated that all farmers' perception, socio-economic, farming
   features, and institutional conditions strongly influence the farmers'
   adaptation decisions regarding FF\&LS. Future policies may therefore
   need to consider these major contributing factors with appropriate
   interventions to facilitate suitable adaptations for local farmers.}},

Abstract = {{Cities increasingly use real-time control of combined sewer systems and
   green infrastructure to decrease emissions to surface waters, and
   incorporate infrastructure into the urban landscape to reduce flooding
   from short, intense rainfall events called cloudbursts, which can cause

   use of integrated stormwater inflow control to dynamically activate
   cloudburst conveyance infrastructure in the urban landscape as well as
   green storage elements more often than originally intended. This control
   facilitates synergy between sewers, green infrastructure and the urban
   landscape, and has lower environmental impacts than isolated control
   approaches. A simulated, yet realistic, case study in Copenhagen,
   Denmark, shows that combined sewage emissions can be eliminated or
   reduced substantially in this manner. Other potential benefits include
   increasing amenity value and educating citizens, for example. The
   results suggest that the proposed control concept potentially provides a

Abstract = {{Flash floods are among the most disastrous natural hazards worldwide
   because of their rapid onset that limits effective emergency response
   and management. Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of
   flash floods can help emergency managers and stakeholders in devising
   solutions to mitigate the associated risks and damages. In this study, a
   data-driven approach is employed to characterize flash flood hazard
   across the contiguous United States (CONUS). The National Weather
   Service (NWS) Storm Events database is utilized, and a total of 74,814
   flash flood events are assessed during 1996-2017. The frequency,
   duration, property damages, and fatalities of flash floods are
   investigated across spatial domains (i.e. county, state, regional, and
   entire CONUS) and multiple temporal scales (i.e. annual, seasonal,
   monthly, and diurnal). Results indicate that flash flood frequency has
   slightly increased over the CONUS in the past 22 years, and the property
   damages have substantially raised. Flash floods are found to be more
   frequent in summer and less frequent but longer in winter. Our analyses
   indicate distinct regional patterns for duration of median versus
   extreme flash floods. In addition, the diurnal distribution of flash
   floods indicate that they are more likely to initiate in the evening and
   terminate around midnight. The average duration of flash floods in the
   past 22 years has been about 3.5 h, yet in some rare cases, they
   persisted for about two days. The findings of this study can shed light
   on flash flood hazard across the CONUS, which can be useful for
   mitigating flash flood risks.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{A danger level at a river location is the level above which a flood may
   cause loss and damage to nearby lives, crops, and homesteads. Currently,
   in Bangladesh, the danger level is designed and updated considering the
   riverine flood during the monsoon season (June-September). However,
   during the premonsoon season (March-May), flash floods, almost every
   year, damage crops in some parts of the northeast Haor (saucer- or
   bowl-shaped large tectonic depression) region. Damage to Boro rice, the
   only crop that is grown in this region, is catastrophic to the local
   population and threatens the food security of the country. At present,
   there is no warning or danger level to inform the community to save the
   Boro crops from flash floods in that region. Hence, this study attempts
   to establish a flash flood danger level at 40 locations in the northeast
   region of Bangladesh based on flood frequency analysis and elevations of
   the river floodplains. The homogeneity and adequacy of the data series
   was tested by performing the run test, lag 1 auto correlation,
   Mann-Kendall test, and Mann-Whitney test. After passing the data quality
   tests, flood frequency analysis was conducted using six widely used
   distributions: lognormal, lognormal Type III, Pearson Type III,
   log-Pearson Type III, and Gumbel and generalized extreme value (GEV)
   distributions. Best regional distribution was selected from the
   probability plot correlations coefficient (PPCC), normalized root mean
   square error (NRMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) results. Among the
   candidate distributions, GEV distribution was found to provide the best
   results. Then, the danger level was fixed on the basis of the flooding
   inundation scenarios of different return periods at which the stage is
   at or near the floodplain level. The results showed that for most of the
   stations, the 2.33-year flood level coincides with the existing
   floodplain level. For the rest of the stations, flash flood danger
   levels were fixed at the 5-year return period's flood level. The
   recommended flash flood danger levels were found much lower than the
   existing monsoon flood danger levels. For example, at Sunamganj station,
   the existing flood danger level is 8.25 mPWD (Public Works Datum)
   whereas the recommended flash flood danger level is only 6.41 mPWD. At
   some stations, the difference is too prominent, even more than 5 m,
   which can cause severe destruction for the Boro rice cultivation during
   a flash flood. It is expected that flash flood danger levels estimated
   in this study may assist in flash flood forecasting in the northeast
   Haor region and provide an effective warning at the time of necessity,
   thus minimizing the loss and damage by the flash flood to some extent.

Abstract = {{Over recent decades, the number of people and the capital invested in
   flood-prone areas has undergone a significant increase worldwide,

   the causes and consequences of inefficient flood risk governance along
   the Spanish Mediterranean coastal municipalities. For that purpose,
   national and regional flood management policies were contrasted with the
   outcomes of a spatial intersection between cadastral data at local level
   and floodable areas, for different return periods (10, 50, 100 and 500

Abstract = {{Several regions of the world have been affected by one of the natural
   disasters named as flash floods. Many villagers who live near stream or
   dam, they suffer a lot in terms of property, cattle and human lives
   loss. Conventional early warning systems are not up to the mark for the
   early warning announcements. Diversified approaches have been carried
   out for the identification of flash floods with less false alarm rate.
   Forecasting approaches includes some errors and ambiguity due to the
   incompetent processing algorithms and measurement readings. Process
   variables like stream flow, water level, water color, precipitation
   velocity, wind speed, wave's pattern and cloud to ground (CG) flashes
   have been measured for the robust identification of flash floods. A
   vibrant competent algorithm would be required for the investigation of
   flash floods with less false alarm rate. In this research paper
   classifiers have been applied on the collected data set so that any
   researcher could easily know that which classifier is competent and can
   be further enhanced by combining it with other algorithms. A novel
   comprehensive parametric comparison has been performed to investigate
   the classification accuracy for the robust classification of false
   alarms. For the better accuracy more than one process variables have
   been measured but still contained some false alarm. Appropriate
   combination of sensor was integrated to increase the accuracy in results
   as multi-modal sensing device has been designed to collect the data.
   Linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, quadratic support
   vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and Ensemble bagged tree have been
   applied to the collected data set for the data classification. Results
   have been obtained in the MATLAB and discussed in detail in the research
   paper. The worst accuracy of the classification (62\%) has been achieved
   by the coarse k-NN classifier that means coarse k-NN produced 38\% false
   negative rate that is not acceptable in the case of forecasting.
   Ensemble bagged trees produced best classification results as it
   achieved 99 \% accuracy and 1\% error rate. Furthermore, according to
   the comprehensive parametric comparison of regression models Quadratic
   SVM found to be the worst with mean square error of 0.5551 and time
   elapsed 13.159 seconds. On the other hand, Exponential Gaussian process
   regression performed better than the other existing approaches with the
   minimum root mean squared error of 0.0002 and prediction speed of 35000
   observations per second.}},

Abstract = {{The management of torrential flood risk areas located in natural
   protected sites requires special approaches. Also, those processes can
   cause casualties and damage socioeconomic structures (roads, railways,
   houses, etc.) The processes intercept protected landscapes, sometimes
   endangering protected species and habitats. The restoration of the
   streambed's stability in protected areas and the protection of the
   economic objectives affected by the torrential floods, imply special
   measures of planning. The planning measures are based on the use of
   ecological materials and technologies with minimal impact on the
   environment.
   The article presents a methodology for identifying small river basins
   with high torrential risk and the endangered economic objectives, as
   well as applying this methodology into three Natura 2000 sites from
   central Romania (ROSCI0207 Postavaru, ROSCI0195 Piatra Mare and ROSCI
   0038 Ciucas).
   Identification of the basins was made considering their geomorphological
   and hydrological characteristics and the vulnerability of the
   intercepted socio-economic objectives. Into identified watershed,
   measurements of the streambed topography and the geometric
   characteristics of the endangered structures were made.
   Based on hydraulic simulations, maps were generated for floods with a
   100-year return period. Using these flood maps, the maximum water level
   was determined to highlight the flood risk areas for each socioeconomics
   structural objective.
   In areas identified as floodplain, special structural and nonstructural
   solutions are proposed for guiding water into convenient paths to avoid
   the endangered structures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, as extreme weather increasingly threatens human health and

   application of three (3) models: The WRF-ARW weather model, the
   WRF-Hydro hydrological model, and the HEC-RAS 2D hydraulic model. A
   flash flood event that occurred on 9 October 2006 in Volos city, Greece,
   is used as a case study to assess the accuracy of the integrated
   modelling approach to simulate the flood hydrograph and flood extent in
   Xerias ungauged catchment. The hydrometeorological simulation results
   indicated a severe persistent storm over Pelion mountain at the
   northeast of Volos, as the main factor of the major flash flood and
   extensive impacts. Historical flood records retrieved by several
   conventional and non-conventional sources are used to validate the
   flooded area. Compared to the collected data and prior studies, the
   generated inundation map of Xerias river is found to realistically
   capture highly impacted areas which experienced infrastructure damage

Abstract = {{The national warning system, Vigicrues Flash, developed by the French
   national service in charge of flood forecasting (SCHAPI), provides flash
   flood warnings at ungauged locations based on a discharge-threshold
   flood warning method called AIGA. The AIGA method leads to characterize
   flood hazard in real time at any point along the river network. A
   simplified hourly-distributed hydrologic model ingests the operational
   radar-based Quantitative Precipitation Estimate grids from Meteo-France
   at a 1-km(2) resolution to produce real-time peak discharge estimates
   along the river network. Every 15 minutes, these discharges are compared
   to reference flood quantiles, which were estimated from streamflow
   simulated time series (using the same model). A web interface provides
   in real time maps of the rivers exceeding the high flood and very high
   flood thresholds, as well as the associated municipalities. The
   automated system sends warning messages to registered users who might be
   impacted to help them better mitigate flood risk impacts. To better
   detect and anticipate flash flooding, the hydrologic model is being
   enhanced to ingest the Meteo-France's AROME-NWC high-resolution
   precipitation nowcasts, provided at a 1.3-km resolution for a 6-hr
   forecast horizon, and hourly updated. To account for the forecast
   uncertainties, the deterministic AROME-NWC forecasts are ingested as
   time-lagged ensembles and combined with multiple sets of hydrological
   regionalized parameters. The resulting flow ensembles lead to define
   probabilistic flood warnings. The evaluation, carried out on 13
   significant events from October 2015 to June 2017 for 750 French basins,
   shows significant improvements in terms of flash flood event detection
   and effective warning lead time, compared to warnings from the current
   Vigicrues Flash setup (without any future precipitation), and the added
   value of probabilistic warnings.}},

Abstract = {{The city of Nimes is exposed to flood risks (especially to flash
   floods). No major river flows in the dense urban area of the city.
   Instead, dry canals called ``cadereaux{''} cross the city and are used
   to collect water runoff. The Mediterranean rains, the small catchment
   basins (size under 30 km(2)) and the karstic type as well as the
   piedmont situation are factors bringing about significant runoff with
   major overflow and flash floods. After the floods that took place on the
   3rd of October 1988, the city of Nimes launched a new ambitious policy
   aiming at preventing flooding risks, including important works on the
   ``cadereaux{''}. In 2004, as part of this process, the city implemented
   an alert system ESPADA (Evaluation et suivi des precipitations en
   agglomeration pour devancer l'alerte). The goal of this system is to
   forecast the ``cadereaux{''} flow rates up to 1 h 30 ahead, by using a
   hydrological model with sharp representation of the karstic ecosystem.
   In 2014, within the framework of the Programs of Actions for Inundations
   Prevention, the city of Nimes initiated the modernization of the ESPADA
   system to improve the quality of the input data in real time (5-min time
   step). A radio network dedicated to the collection of the data (through
   the city's hydrometeorological sensors) was put in place, thus offering
   a secure and efficient data collection. The radio network also enables
   real-time data collection from the SPC-GD (Service de prevision des
   crues du Grand Delta, regional office in charge of flood prevention)
   stations. Furthermore, the city developed a high resolution spatial
   radar which enables rain measurement and forecasting. By using 500 m
   pixels waves, this tool can identify local intensities on the small
   drainage basins. Data calibration is made with rain gauges which are
   available. As part of the second step of modernization, the forecasting
   model is now being improved in order to work continuously with 5-min
   time step. The propagation is managed by 1D hydraulic model. In
   addition, the linmnigraphic data are used in real time to update the
   flow rates values and the storage levels of the basins. Similarly, a web
   interface is currently under development, allowing crisis-management
   key-players to efficiently use the risk mitigation tools. Over time, the
   general public will have access to some of the ESPADA system, using an
   interface similar to the Vigicrues portal.}},

Abstract = {{After different failures observed in the use of church tombs for

Abstract = {{Many urban areas face an increasing flood risk, which includes the risk
   of flash floods. Increasing extreme precipitation events will likely
   lead to greater human and economic losses unless reliable and efficient
   early warning systems (EWS) along with other adaptation actions are put
   in place in urban areas. The challenge is in the integration and
   analysis in time and space of the environmental, meteorological, and
   territorial data from multiple sources needed to build up EWS able to
   provide efficient contribution to increase the resilience of vulnerable
   and exposed urban communities to flooding. Efficient EWS contribute to

   addressed this matter, focusing on the improvement of knowledge,
   methods, and tools for the monitoring and forecast of extreme
   precipitation events and the assessment of the associated flood risk for
   small and medium watercourses in urban areas. To put this into practice,
   RainBO developed a webGIS platform, which contributes to the

Abstract = {{Flash floods are unexpected events, which evolve rapidly and affect
   relatively small areas. The short time available for minimising risks
   requires preparedness and active response. In this context of risk
   management, the flood risk perception of the local population is the
   first step towards achieving resilience of people and communities.
   Although flood risk perception has intrinsic spatial variability, few
   previous studies take this into account. This paper explores the spatial
   variability of flash flood risk perception in the village of Navaluenga
   in Central Spain, using nonparametric and multivariate geostatistical
   tools. How local people perceived the flash flood risk to their homes
   was assessed interviewing a representative sample. Results show that
   considering these flash flood risk related spatial variables enhances
   people's psychological interpretation of risk perception: the perception
   of flash flood risk in a short time event is congruent with those
   spatial variables. These findings determine priority areas for future
   risk communication plans. They could also be extrapolated to other urban
   areas with a similar hydrographic configuration, when there is a flood
   hazard from a main river and potentially flooded minor water courses,
   which are even closer to houses but are not considered dangerous by the
   local population.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a hydrologic assessment approach implemented in a
   safety-inspection methodology for river bridges in Turkey was developed
   in which various hydrologic indicators such as morphometric parameters,
   land cover and use, precipitation magnitude and type, flood history, and
   presence of retention structures were selected to assess hydrologic
   behavior and flash-flood potential of the bridge watershed. According to
   the proposed approach, hydrologic grading of the watersheds was
   performed by summing up the grades of the indicators and classifying the
   bridge watershed with regard to the flash-flood susceptibility of the
   bridge. This hydrologic assessment approach was applied to 10 river
   bridges in the Western Black Sea Basin in Turkey, where bridges are
   often affected by severe flash floods. It was found that the selected
   indicators encouragingly exhibited the flood potential and hydrologic
   behavior of the watersheds by comparing the grades of the bridges
   considered. So, hydrologic assessment could enable engineers to take
   necessary precautions against effects of flooding on river bridges both
   in design and operation stages. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Private risk reduction behaviours can significantly reduce the negative
   impacts of flooding and flash floods. Over the past decades, researchers
   have used various socio-cognitive models or threat and coping mechanisms
   to explain individual protective behaviours. However, these models
   ignore the fact that people are not equally ready to act upon a danger,
   and they (the models) give limited insights into the effectiveness of
   communication strategies to foster risk reduction behaviours. Therefore,
   we explored the current state of homeowners' readiness to undertake risk
   reduction behaviours in flood risk areas by applying a dynamic
   protection motivation framework. We conducted a survey in an Italian
   municipality that experienced severe flash flooding in September 2018.
   The results show that people are motivated by different factors in
   prompting risk reduction behaviour based on their chosen types of
   protective measures. For example, people that undertook structural or
   avoidance measures are more likely to be motivated to protect themselves
   by increased perceptions of vulnerability and response efficacy and are
   less worried about expected flood losses compared to people that
   undertook only basic emergency measures. In this paper, we argue how
   these new insights contribute to targeting flood risk communication
   strategies to groups of individuals characterized by different readiness
   stages and motivations to protect themselves.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-criteria method is a widely used technique to study and
   analyze the impact and causes of natural hazards. Our study area, that
   forms a part of the governorate of Sohag, lies in Southeast Sohag and is
   one of the most flash flood prone regions of Egypt's Eastern Desert. In
   the last decades, this area of Sohag has suffered from frequent flash
   floods, with some flood events resulting in human casualties. In our
   study, we use a multi-criteria process combined with geographical
   information system (GIS) and remotely sensed data to produce a flash
   flood susceptibility map. In addition, we discuss the various factors
   related to flash flooding such as elevation, slope, drainage network,
   lithology, topographic wetness index, as well as land use, and
   reclassify these based on their contribution and their effect on flood
   probability. To calculate the weighted factor for each raster, a
   pairwise matrix was constructed. Results from our multi-criteria
   analysis for flash flooding indicate that approximately 5\% of the total
   study area is at a very high risk of flooding, 10\% at a high risk, and
   25\% at a moderate flood risk. Furthermore, our results highlight the
   areas at risk of flooding and the need for the development of relevant
   warning systems. Our results also indicate that the southeastern part of
   the study area is most susceptible to flash floods and we suggest that
   the necessary focus be given to this region as well as the
   implementation of a flood warning system. A consistency index was used
   to determine the accuracy of our model and was calculated to be 0.058,
   indicating a well-performing model.}},

Title = {{ReAFFIRM: Real-time Assessment of Flash Flood Impacts - a Regional
   high-resolution Method}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods evolve rapidly in time, which poses particular challenges
   to emergency managers. One way to support decision-making is to
   complement models that estimate the flash flood hazard (e.g. discharge
   or return period) with tools that directly translate the hazard into the
   expected socio-economic impacts. This paper presents a method named
   ReAFFIRM that uses gridded rainfall estimates to assess in real time the
   flash flood hazard and translate it into the corresponding impacts. In
   contrast to other studies that mainly focus on individual river
   catchments, the approach allows for monitoring entire regions at high
   resolution. The method consists of the following three components: (i)
   an already existing hazard module that processes the rainfall into
   values of exceeded return period in the drainage network, (ii) a flood
   map module that employs the flood maps created within the EU Floods
   Directive to convert the return periods into the expected flooded areas
   and flood depths, and (iii) an impact assessment module that combines
   the flood depths with several layers of socioeconomic exposure and
   vulnerability. Impacts are estimated in three quantitative categories:
   population in the flooded area, economic losses, and affected critical
   infrastructures. The performance of ReAFFIRM is shown by applying it in
   the region of Catalonia (NE Spain) for three significant flash flood
   events. The results show that the method is capable of identifying areas
   where the flash floods caused the highest impacts, while some locations
   affected by less significant impacts were missed. In the locations where
   the flood extent corresponded to flood observations, the assessments of
   the population in the flooded area and affected critical infrastructures
   seemed to perform reasonably well, whereas the economic losses were
   systematically overestimated. The effects of different sources of
   uncertainty have been discussed: from the estimation of the hazard to
   its translation into impacts, which highly depends on the quality of the
   employed datasets, and in particular on the quality of the rainfall
   inputs and the comprehensiveness of the flood maps.}},

Abstract = {{Urban growth, extreme climate, and mismanagement are crucial controlling
   factors that affect flood vulnerability at wadi catchments. Therefore,
   this study attempts to understand the impacts of these three factors on
   the flash flood vulnerability in different climatic regions in Egypt. An
   integrated approach is presented to evaluate the urban growth from 1984
   to 2019 by using Google Images and SENTINEL-2 data, and to develop
   hazard maps by using a rainfall-runoff-inundation model (RRI). Annual
   rainfall trend analysis was performed to evaluate the temporal
   variability trend. The hazard maps that were created were classified
   into three categories (low, medium, and high) and integrated with the
   urban growth maps to evaluate the impacts on the flood-vulnerable areas.
   The results show a significant increase in urban growth resulting in an
   increase of prone areas for flood hazards over time. However, the degree
   of this hazard is mainly related to growth directions. Mismanagement
   affects urban growth directions in both planned and unplanned growth,
   whether by loss of control over unplanned growth or by deficiencies in
   approved plans. The rainfall analysis showed that there is no explicit
   relationship to increases or decreases in the flood vulnerable areas. An
   urban planning approach is recommended for risk reduction management

Abstract = {{Flash floods are among the most severe natural hazards that cause
   disastrous environmental and human impacts. The city of Gabes (Southern
   Tunisia) is prone to harmful flooding, because of its location on a low
   plane and its extremely erratic rainfall distribution. Flood risk
   associated with this is expected to increase further in the coming years
   due to the high rate of urbanization and an ever growing population. A
   particular interest is given to a major flooding event, which is the
   single event that hit the region in the summer season over the last
   century. Statistical tools, satellite images treatment and analysis,
   meteorological observation data, Geographic Information System (GIS),
   and survey data were considered in order to understand and explore the
   different causes of this disaster, its extent and its consequences. ERA5
   is a new global reanalysis tool which was used in this study to evaluate
   spatial and temporal extent of the examined major rainfall event. A
   survey was also conducted with 108 participants from different areas of
   the city. This latter revealed a variety of causes which amplified the
   flood disaster. The results obtained showed that the flood risk depends
   not only on rainfall intensity and the event total duration but also on
   land use, urban development, oasis destruction, and other anthropogenic
   settings. In this study, procedures are developed to classify and rank
   the causes and the impacts from the least to the most severe, with
   special attention to certain problematic spots in the city that were
   analyzed in detail. Flooding extent areas were estimated and were shown
   to be in good agreement with the observation data. Recommendations and
   scenarios to mitigate flood risk are also provided.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{An enquiry-based and participatory analysis approach is carried out to
   identify the strengths and weaknesses in the heterogeneous legislations
   across Europe that regulate the integration of landslide hazard into
   urban planning. Twenty one national and eight regional Geological
   Surveys (GSs) have participated in the analysis. The GSs report almost
   4000 recent (2015-2017) damaging landslides events resulting in 39
   fatalities and 155 injuries, destruction to housing, infrastructure and
   properties. In addition, 11 countries report 18 MORLE events over the
   past 10 years responsible for 150 fatalities and severe economic
   impacts. Results also reveal almost 48 million people living in areas
   with high and very high degrees of landslide-susceptibility (around 1
   million km(2) according to ELSUS v2). This work shows that almost half
   the participating countries (10 countries) have no legal guidance in the
   National Land Bill to stipulate consideration of landslides in urban
   planning practices, and mapping tools are often not adapted to a
   standard required to inform sustainable development. Furthermore, there
   is a wide range of laws and a large heterogeneity of mapping methods,
   scales and procedures. A relevant deficiency detected in many countries
   is the lack of landslide maps at a detailed resolution for urban
   planning. Additionally, some case studies of suboptimal urban
   development practices in areas of known instability have been discussed;
   they are found to be related to weak rule of law and/or absence of good
   governance. This paper shows inconsistencies across Europe in the
   handling of landslides and proposes a series of key actions to improve
   this situation, highlighting the need for a common regulatory framework
   to deal with this geohazard appropriately.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of the initial impact force is a major task associated with
   flood damage assessment of structures subjected to flash flooding

   impact. Therefore, a careful assessment of the initial flood impact is
   critical for the design of structures and during the flood damage
   assessment process. In most of the past flood damage studies, total
   flood load acting on the structures was estimated by maximum velocities

   modelling the three-dimensional free surface fluid-structure interaction

Abstract = {{Urbanization of stream ecosystems with the purpose of managing the
   flash-flood events is nowadays considered responsible for habitat loss
   and alteration of the natural flow regime with severe implications for
   the ecosystem functioning. Unsurprisingly, the river scientists have
   started seeking alternative options inspired from nature for mitigating
   the flood-risk and maintaining the stream at its natural state. With
   this article the authors demonstrate the effects of a nature-based
   solution (NBS) for managing an urban stream based on the use of
   bioengineering materials (e.g. plants) and the implementation of the
   actions that restore the stream to its natural form (e.g channel
   widening). The HEC-RAS software was employed to simulate the flow and
   hydraulic components of an approximately 800m long reach of an urban
   stream under three different scenarios of flood risk management with a
   design flow set to 400 m(3)/s. The first scenario was based on the
   current situation of the stream, the second scenario concerned the
   stream restoration by following the nature-based solutions, while the
   third scenario was based on the classical ``grey{''} engineering
   approach of concrete channelization. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
   photogrammetry methods and the Pix4Dmapper software were used in order
   to develop a detailed 3D model of the studied reach that accurately
   captured the current geomorphology. The obtained results showed that
   with concrete channelization, the average and maximum flow of the stream
   increases significantly in relation to the current situation, from 2.48
   and 4.88m/s to 9.82 and 11.22 m/s, respectively, while the average
   Froude number raises from 0.36 to 1.69 implying super-critical flows. In
   contrast, the NBS scenario retained lower flow velocities and average
   Froude number similar to those under the current conditions. In
   addition, a cost estimation analysis for both stream management
   techniques revealed that the NBS is much cheaper than the traditional
   channelization (1.1 mil (sic) vs 5.6 mil (sic)). In conclusion, our
   findings suggest that the future restoration of urban streams should
   consider the nature-based solutions since i) they can be effective with
   regard to the reduction of flood-risk, ii) are cheaper than the
   traditional ``grey{''} techniques and, most importantly, iii) maintain
   the natural state of the ecosystem which improves not only the ecosystem
   functioning but also the aesthetic value within the urban context.}},

Abstract = {{High magnitude flash flood has occurred several times in some areas in
   Central Sulawesi Province after the 2018 Palu Earthquake, one of them is
   in the Bangga River, Sigi Regency, Indonesia. It has caused massive
   impacts such as damaging agricultural and plantation areas and
   submerging public facilities and infrastructure and even causing
   fatalities. The flood carries a variety of materials, especially high
   concentration sediments which are thought to originate from eroded soils
   due to landslides induced by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. These materials
   are eroded and transported by the flow at the upstream watershed due to
   heavy rainfall. This study intends to investigate the potential of
   landslides, factors that trigger floods and increased flooding after the
   earthquake. This research was conducted by investigating the landslides
   potency based on field surveys and interpretation of the latest
   satellite imagery, analyzing the characteristics of rainfall as a
   trigger for flooding, and predicting the flood potency as the primary
   impact of these two factors. Rainfall-flood transformation was simulated
   with the HEC-HMS Model, one of the freeware semi-distributed models
   commonly used in hydrological analysis. The model input is the
   configuration of river networks generated from the National DEM
   (DEMNAS), hourly rainfall during floods and other watershed parameters
   such as land cover, soil types and river slope. The similar simulation
   was also carried out on the condition of the watershed before the
   earthquake. Based on the results of the analysis, It can be inferred
   that flash floods in the Bangga River are mainly caused by heavy
   rainfall with long duration and landslide areas in the upper watershed
   triggered by the 2018 Palu Earthquake with an area of approximately 10.8
   km(2). The greatest depth of rainfall as a trigger for flooding is 30.4
   mm with a duration of 8 hours. The results of the study also showed that
   landslides in the upper watershed could increase the peak flood by
   33.33\% from 118.56 m(3)/s to 158.08 m(3)/s for conditions before and
   after the earthquake.}},

Abstract = {{In developing countries, the urbanisation process occurs with empirical
   urban management, a high increase of impermeable areas, and a lack of
   connection between water resource management and planning. In Brazil,
   concentrated rainfall and ineffective urban drainage systems add to this
   context and may impact the population with flash floods. Although
   sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) are widely used for flood
   mitigation, it is still not very well known how those strategies behave
   in semi-arid regions, where most of the time the weather is very dry. In
   Brazil, flood mitigation still mostly involves structural measures such
   as larger pipes or channels, with limited guidance for SuDS use due to
   the great resistance to change by citizens and managers. This study
   sought to analyse the efficacy of SuDS in Campina Grande, a semi-arid
   region of Brazil. A land-use and legislation-based methodology was
   developed with physical, climate, hydrological and governance data for
   three catchments and 312 sub-catchments in 30 applications and
   simulations. Simulations suggest that these strategies would be
   appropriate for semi-arid regions, with reductions in the flooded area,
   flooding volume, and impacts. This study is of relevance for cities with

Abstract = {{Floods are considered one of the most severe natural disasters
   worldwide. They impact vast areas, particularly in arid/semi-arid
   regions, causing serious damages with thousands of human casualties and
   billions of Euros in economic losses. This study contributes to a
   comprehensive evaluation of flash flooding occurrences, impacts, and
   possible mitigation. In this study, The Dahab region in southern Egypt's
   Sinai Peninsula was selected for flash flooding vulnerability
   assessment. Although located in an arid region, it suffers from frequent
   and severe flash floods. Here, a straightforward workflow was applied to
   simulate the impact of flash flooding and assess the vulnerability of
   the Dahab area via consideration of a maximum storm event as a worst-
   case scenario. Originally, morphometric analysis was performed to
   determine the most hazardous sub-basins susceptible to flash flooding.
   The highest recorded storm event in the region was selected to calculate
   the maximum volume of surface runoff for the model simulation. Then, the
   hydrologic model and River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software were used
   to calculate the inundation level across the entire city of Dahab.
   Despite some data limitations, this study shows clearly that the Dahab
   area would have problems incurring from flash flooding if no mitigation
   measures were to be considered. Results indicate that the area of Dahab
   is greatly vulnerable to flash flooding with approximately 72\% of the
   total infrastructure being negatively impacted in the worst-case
   scenario. The adopted approach used in this study can be applied
   efficiently in similar regions in the Sinai Peninsula or elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Risk of flash floods is currently an important problem in many parts of

   Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), Radial Basis Function Classifier
   (RBFC), Multinomial Naive Bayes (NBM), and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) to
   generate flash flood susceptibility maps at the minor part of Nghe An
   province of the Center region (Vietnam) where recurrent flood problems
   are being experienced. Performance of these four methods was evaluated
   to select the best method for flash flood susceptibility mapping. In the
   model studies, ten flash flood conditioning factors, namely soil, slope,
   curvature, river density, flow direction, distance from rivers,
   elevation, aspect, land use, and geology, were chosen based on
   topography and geo-environmental conditions of the site. For the
   validation of models, the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic
   (ROC), Area Under Curve (AUC), and various statistical indices were
   used. The results indicated that performance of all the models is good

Title = {{Climate change vulnerability of rural households in flood-prone areas of

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY}},
Abstract = {{The Himalayan foothills of West Bengal are a part of the great Eastern
   Himalaya, which is by locational virtue a recognized flood-prone area.
   The area is also well known for frequent and heavy rain storms and
   climate-induced catastrophic events, such as flash floods due to the
   unprecedented rains in the Bhutan Himalaya. Therefore, climate-induced
   disasters like floods have been the prime reasons for rural
   vulnerabilities. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study is to
   find out whether there are any differences between levels of
   vulnerability amidst agriculture-dependent villages and forest
   resource-dependent villages in the same flood-prone area or not. In
   addition, the study will also examine how the agriculture-dependent
   villages are different from forest resource-dependent villages in terms
   of climate vulnerability and vice versa. The climate change
   vulnerability index has been applied, and a total of 100 households have
   been surveyed covering seven dimensions of vulnerability. The exposure
   score was found to be the highest in Raja Bhatkhawa (0.41) followed by
   Nathuar Char (0.30) and Bhelakoba (0.27). No significant differences
   were found in terms of climatic exposure except in Mendabari. Further,
   it has been observed that the resilience factors in households like
   education, workforce opportunities, health, and institutional
   accessibility are highly uneven, which has been creating hinders to the
   adaptive capacity. In the villages where overall vulnerability to
   climate change was found to be high, the adaptive capacity was found to
   be low. Simultaneously, in those villages, the sensitivity was found to
   be high. It has been found that the location of the villages plays an
   important role when it comes to vulnerability because the forest
   villages are relatively more vulnerable than the agricultural villages.
   However, the riverside location of Nathuar Char has made this village
   highly vulnerable; and the people of Nathuar Char have been living with
   floods, and they are trying to adapt with climate-induced floods.
   Finally, it has been observed that vulnerability is context dependent
   (i.e. based on land resources, accessibility to basic infrastructure,
   water and sanitation facilities, and awareness to disasters) and varies
   from household to household.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Flash flood is a recurrent natural hazard with substantial impacts in
   the Southeast US (SEUS) due to the frequent torrential rainfalls that
   occur in the region, which are triggered by tropical storms,
   thunderstorms, and hurricanes. Flash floods are costly natural hazards,
   primarily due to their rapid onset. Therefore, predicting property
   damage of flash floods is imperative for proactive disaster management.
   Here, we present a systematic framework that considers a variety of
   features explaining different components of risk (i.e. hazard,
   vulnerability, and exposure), and examine multiple machine learning
   methods to predict flash flood damage. A large database of flash flood
   events consisting of more than 14 000 events are assessed for training
   and testing the methodology, while a multitude of data sources are
   utilized to acquire reliable information related to each event. A
   variable selection approach was employed to alleviate the complexity of
   the dataset and facilitate the model development process. The random
   forest (RF) method was then used to map the identified input covariates
   to a target variable (i.e. property damage). The RF model was
   implemented in two modes: first, as a binary classifier to estimate if a
   region of interest was damaged in any particular flood event, and then
   as a regression model to predict the amount of property damage
   associated with each event. The results indicate that the proposed
   approach is successful not only for classifying damaging events (with an
   accuracy of 81\%), but also for predicting flash flood damage with a
   good agreement with the observed property damage. This study is among
   the few efforts for predicting flash flood damage across a large domain
   using mesoscale input variables, and the findings demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}},

Title = {{An approximation method for evaluating flash flooding mitigation of
   sponge city strategies - A case study of Central Geelong}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{257}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Urban flooding is a severe problem and a growing development challenge
   for many cities around the world. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
   introduce mitigation measures through managing rainwater to reduce these
   risks. The sponge city system is regarded as an effective mechanism to
   manage rainwater and reduce flooding, as it is capable of promoting
   infiltration and retaining rainwater. However, the main challenge is how
   to efficiently quantify and visualise the flooding mitigation effects of
   a sponge city project with various technical measures. There is also a
   lack of cost analysis of sponge city strategies to reduce risks of a
   large-scale urban project. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate and
   visualise mitigation effects from sponge city strategies on urban
   floods. This paper establishes a rapid and simplified modelling
   framework for assessing the approximate effects of sponge city
   strategies on flooding mitigation through GIS simulation in a real-world
   environment. Various sponge city elements, such as green roofs and
   wetlands, are systematically integrated in a rainfall-runoff model.
   Central Geelong will be used as a case study. Scenarios are created in
   terms of project expenditure, green benefit and infiltration. With the
   GIS mapping technologies and MATLAB-based digital image processing, maps
   presenting results for the proposed scenarios are displayed to visualise
   the mitigation effects of the strategies on urban flooding inundation.
   The results reveal that the sponge city strategies are capable of
   generating varying degrees of mitigation of urban flash floods. The
   scenario with the largest infiltration volume has shown the most
   significant effect on the flooding mitigation, such as a reduction of
   80\% in the runoff volume during a one-in-50-year rainfall event, but it
   may cost twice as much as other options. Overall, this study could be
   applied to rapid assessment measures of sponge city strategies in the
   flooding control and decision making on urban green infrastructure
   planning. The approach proposed here could be adopted for disaster
   mitigation though sponge city technologies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Floods are a prominent risk factor in the world of public health, as
   there is a risk of dispersal of harmful biological and chemical
   contaminants in floodwater. As climate change increases, the occurrence
   of natural disasters and risk of adverse health outcomes due to flash
   flooding also increases. Fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia
   coli and Enterococci, are often encountered in contaminated floodwater
   and can cause gastrointestinal illnesses as well as a variety of
   infections. In August 2016, East Baton Rouge and surrounding parishes in
   Louisiana suffered heavy floods due to intense rainfall. No study of
   water quality during flooding has been conducted previously in Baton
   Rouge, Louisiana. Twenty-three pre-flush and post-flush water samples
   were collected immediately from accessible homes that had been affected
   by the floods in order to quantify concentrations of fecal indicator
   bacteria. These samples were analyzed for the presence of E. coli and
   Enterococci through both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
   and the IDEXX enzyme substrate method. The qPCR results indicated that
   30\% of the samples contained Enterococci and 61\% of the samples
   contained E. coli, with the highest concentrations found in the
   pre-flush outdoor hose and the pre-flush kitchen tap. The IDEXX method
   yielded total coliforms in 65\% of the samples, E. coli in 4\%, and
   Enterococci in 35\%, with the highest concentrations in the pre-flush
   outdoor faucet and the pre-flush post-filtration kitchen tap. Physical
   parameters including temperature, barometer pressure, dissolved oxygen,
   oxidation reduction potential, pH, conductivity, and salinity of these
   samples were also recorded. Of these parameters, conductivity and
   salinity were significant, suggesting they may positively influence E.
   coli and Enterococci growth.}},

Title = {{Bayesian lifetime analysis for landslide dams}},
Journal = {{LANDSLIDES}},
Abstract = {{Landslide dams are a common hazard which threaten downstream human
   settlement or infrastructure, as their collapse may result in a flash
   flood. The danger is compounded by the amount of water accumulated;
   therefore, estimation of the time to failure becomes crucial for
   assessing engineering risk mitigation procedures. Dam dimension indices,
   descriptive multivariate analysis and logistic regression have been used
   to produce a static image of the dam conditions, estimating the
   probability of failure, but they provide no information of when a
   failure might occur. We propose a Bayesian model to predict the time to
   failure of landslide dams, based on imputing missing dam and reservoir
   measurements via an analysis of their covariate structure. The resulting
   data is then used in a Bayesian survival model which links the
   (censored) failure time to dam and reservoir variables. A case study on
   heterogeneous Italian events is presented, on which our model is tested.
   Results show that it is possible to produce a probabilistic model of
   time to failure. The length and height of dams, and the catchment area
   behind them, are identified as the most important covariates controlling
   the time to failure. The addition of area-based intercepts confirms the
   robustness of the methodology. Examples of potential results
   (forecasting) and possible generalizations of the model are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are among the most destructive natural hazards that cost lives
   and disrupt the socioeconomic activities of residents, especially in the
   rapidly growing cities of developing countries. Jeddah, a coastal city
   situated in Saudi Arabia, has experienced severe flash flood events in
   recent years. With intense rainfall, extensive coastal developments, and
   sensitive ecosystems, the city is susceptible to severe flash flood
   risks. The objective of this article is to apply an Analytic Hierarchy
   Process (AHP) model to explore the impacts of flash flood hazards and
   identify the most effective approaches to reducing the flash flood
   impacts in Jeddah using expert's opinions. The study utilizes experts'
   judgments and employs the AHP for data analyses and modeling. The
   results indicated that property loss has the highest probability of
   occurrence in the events of a flash flood with a priority level of 42\%,
   followed by productivity loss (28\%). Injuries and death were rated the
   least priority of 18\% and 12\%, respectively. Concerning flood impact
   reduction alternatives, river management (41\%) and early warning system
   (38\%) are the most favorable options. The findings could assist the
   government to design appropriate measures to safeguard the lives and
   properties of the residents. The study concludes by underscoring the
   significance of incorporating experts' judgments in assessing flash
   flood impacts.}},

Title = {{Exposure to Geo-Hydrological Hazards of the Metropolitan Area of Genoa,
   Italy: A Multi-Temporal Analysis of the Bisagno Stream}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Geo-hydrological risk reduction policies are becoming a critical
   challenge for environmental sustainability, both at the national and
   international levels. The reason is twofold: On the one hand, climate
   change has increase rainfall frequency and intensity, while on the
   other, reckless urban expansion has increased exposure to such hazards
   over time. Italy is a country that is very vulnerable to flood and
   landslide hazard; the city of Genoa, which, in recent decades, has been
   frequently hit by severe floods, has risen to symbolize Italian
   geo-hydrological risk. Recent studies on Genoa's geo-hydrological hazard
   have focused on the analysis of hydro-geomorphological features of the
   Bisagno stream basin, yet their main focus was on hazard control. Very
   little research has been done to enhance the understanding of the source
   of risk in such catchments. This paper presents a study on the increased
   urban exposure and vulnerability to geo-hydrological hazard along the
   Bisagno stream catchment area over the last 200 years. Morphometric
   analyses were coupled with historical documents showing the evolution of
   the urban layout in this area. The results show that the ``Bisagno
   Master Plan{''}, a territorial planning strategy aimed at reducing
   geo-hydrological hazard and risk, has not produced the expected
   benefits. In spite of the plan, critical changes in land use and the
   hydrographic network, along with uncontrolled anthropization of the
   Genoa metropolitan area, has continued over the last two decades.}},

Title = {{Implementation of Nature-Based Solutions for Hydro-Meteorological Risk
   Reduction in Small Mediterranean Catchments: The Case of Portofino
   Natural Regional Park, Italy}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Nature-based solutions (NBS) are usually defined as complementary or
   alternative solutions to ``grey infrastructures{''} (traditionally made
   with cement) aimed at conserving and regenerating the functionality of
   natural and semi-natural ecosystems. The research to date shows a
   considerable potential of NBS to address the current challenges related
   to climate change and geo-hydrological risks. Despite significant
   interest in NBS by researchers and practitioners, knowledge concerning
   their practical implementation, monitoring, and evaluation is still
   lacking. This is particularly true for large-scale NBS. The present
   paper discusses how such solutions can be implemented in the context of
   hydro-meteorological risk reduction in small Mediterranean catchments
   with a strong tourist vocation. The work presented here is situated
   within the RECONECT Project (Regenerating ECOsystems with Nature-based
   solutions for hydro-meteorological risk rEduCTion), which aims to
   contribute to a European reference framework on NBS by demonstrating,
   upscaling, and replicating large-scale NBS in rural and natural areas.
   The Italian case study of RECONECT is the Portofino Natural Regional
   Park, which represents a unique natural landscape element with high
   ecologic, social, and economic (touristic) value, which is threatened by
   a range of geo-hydrological hazards, such as flash floods,
   hyper-concentrated floods, shallow landslides, rockfalls, and storm
   surges. This paper also presents details of NBS interventions in two
   pilot catchments (San Fruttuoso and Paraggi) visited by thousands of
   tourists throughout the year. It addresses some of the key aspects
   related to monitoring meteorological and hydrological processes, as well
   as remote sensing activities (i.e., LiDAR surveys), which are necessary
   for the identification of critical-instability areas along waterways and
   the reconstruction of dry stone walls. Lastly, a discussion of relevant
   mitigation and adaptation strategies that are potentially replicable at
   national and international levels is also provided.}},

Abstract = {{Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a widely used method in solving
   classification and regression applications in industries, engineering,
   and science. This study investigates the optimizing capability of a
   swarm intelligence algorithm named moth flame optimizer (MFO) for the
   optimal search of a CNN hyper-parameters (values of filters) and weights
   of fully connected layers. The proposed model was run with a
   3-dimensional dataset (7 width height depth), which was constructed
   through including seven neighbor pixels (vertically and horizontally)
   from landslide location and 12 predictor variables. Muong Te district,
   Lai Chau province, Vietnam was selected as the case study, as it had
   recently undergone severe impacts of landslides and flash floods. The
   performance of this proposed model was compared with conventional
   classifiers, i.e., Random forest, Random subspace, and CNN-optimized
   Adaptive gradient descend, by using standard metrics. The results showed
   that the CNN-optimized MFO (Root mean square error \& x003D; 0.3685,
   Mean absolute error \& x003D; 0.2888, Area under Receiver characteristic
   curve \& x003D; 0.889 and Overall accuracy \& x003D; 80.1056 \& x0025;)
   outperformed the benchmarked methods in all comparing indicators.
   Besides, the statistical test of difference was also carried out by
   using the Wilcoxon signed ranked test for non-parametric variables. With
   these statistical measurements, the proposed model could be used as an
   alternative solution for landslide susceptibility mapping to support
   local disaster preparedness plans.}},

Abstract = {{River floods are among the most damaging natural hazards that frequently
   occur in Germany. Flooding causes high economic losses and impacts many
   residents. In 2016, several southern German municipalities were hit by
   flash floods after unexpectedly severe heavy rainfall, while in 2013
   widespread river flooding had occurred. This study investigates and
   compares the psychological impacts of river floods and flash floods and
   potential consequences for precautionary behaviour. Data were collected
   using computer-aided telephone interviews that were conducted among
   flood-affected households around 9 months after each damaging event.
   This study applies Bayesian statistics and negative binomial regressions
   to test the suitability of psychological indicators to predict the
   precaution motivation of individuals. The results show that it is not
   the particular flood type but rather the severity and local impacts of
   the event that are crucial for the different, and potentially negative,
   impacts on mental health. According to the used data, however,
   predictions of the individual precaution motivation should not be based
   on the derived psychological indicators - i.e. coping appraisal, threat
   appraisal, burden and evasion - since their explanatory power was
   generally low and results are, for the most part, non-significant. Only
   burden reveals a significant positive relation to planned precaution
   regarding weak flash floods. In contrast to weak flash floods and river
   floods, the perceived threat of strong flash floods is significantly
   lower although feelings of burden and lower coping appraisals are more
   pronounced. Further research is needed to better include psychological
   assessment procedures and to focus on alternative data sources regarding
   floods and the connected precaution motivation of affected residents.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of flood early warning system from the perspective of
   experts and three affected communities in urban areas of Pakistan}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Abstract = {{Pakistan has faced frequent flash and riverine flooding in the recent
   decades. This study evaluates the effectiveness of flood EWS from the
   perspectives of local experts/institutions and communities. Interviews
   and consultations with the local experts (13 officials from government
   and other concerned departments) were carried out to understand the
   institutional challenges in communicating early warnings, whereas three
   flood-prone communities from different-sized cities (Rawalpindi, Sialkot
   and Muzaffargarh) were surveyed. A total of 210 samples were collected
   through household questionnaire surveys to assess their understanding of
   the local warning system. The analysis revealed that almost half of the
   community respondents did not receive a warning last time when the flood
   occurred. Variations were also observed regarding the main source of
   early warning in the three communities. This study identifies
   institutional challenges, such as lack of (1) resources to keep an EWS
   equipment operational; (2) community trust; and (3) proper guidelines to
   communicate warnings. The study calls for an immediate revision of
   strategies to communicate early warnings to the end-users and to
   incorporate their feedback in designing/redesigning the early warning
   mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Variation of hydro-environment during past four decades with underground
   sponge city planning to control flash floods in Wuhan, China: An
   overview}},
Journal = {{UNDERGROUND SPACE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of the variation in the hydro-environment
   over the past four decades in Wuhan, China, and discusses its close
   relationship with flash flood events. These flash flood events have
   inundated underground infrastructures and resulted in significant
   economic losses and casualties, which are also discussed in relation to
   various external and internal factors. The external factors are
   predominantly owing to heavy rainstorms resulting from extreme climate
   change. The internal factors predominantly include a decrease in wetland
   areas, changes in topography, and disrepair of drainage systems in urban
   areas. Since the 1970s, lakes in Wuhan have been significantly reduced
   in size (by approximately 40\%). This reduction in wetland area
   decreases the water storage capacity in urban areas, and the frequency
   of large flooding events thus increased from 0.1 event/year to
   approximately 0.2 event/year. Additionally, the disrepair of drainage
   systems in urban areas has reduced their ability to resist flood
   hazards. Changes in topography have also intensified the flood volume
   per unit time, further burdening the drainage systems. In 2016, Wuhan
   suffered from several large flooding events that led to some of the most
   severe economic losses in recorded history. The drainage system at the
   urban center of Wuhan and proposed flood prevention methods are
   discussed in detail in this paper. The sponge city (SPC) concept has
   been attempted in Qingshan District, Wuhan, and its success proved the
   reliability of the theory. A SPC is believed to reduce the impacts of
   future flash floods in China and other developed and developing
   countries. (C) 2020 Tongji University and Tongji University Press.

Title = {{Urban flood inundation and damage assessment based on numerical
   simulations of design rainstorms with different characteristics}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Abstract = {{In the context of global climate change and urbanization, urban flooding
   is an important type of natural disaster that affects urban development,
   especially in China, which is experiencing rapid urbanization. In the
   past 10 years, urban flooding events have caused huge disaster losses in
   Chinese cities. This has resulted in significant negative effects on the
   urban infrastructure, socioeconomic systems, and urban residents, thus
   causing widespread concern. Studies have confirmed the change in extreme
   rainstorms is due to the changing environments in many cities globally
   Conducting studies on the impact of these rainstorms with different
   characteristics for urban flooding is valuable for coping with
   unfavorable situations In addition, numerical simulations provide an
   economical and viable means to perform these studies. This paper
   presents a numerical model of Xiamen Island in China. Simulations were
   conducted for 12 design rainstorm events with different return periods,
   rain patterns, and durations. The results indicate that, in the case of
   an equal rainfall amount, the rainfall intensity is the key factor that
   affects the inundated area, depth, and damages. However, the rainfall
   intensity is not the only determining factor; the rainfall pattern also
   affects the inundations. In regard to the rainfall pattern, a higher
   rainfall peak coefficient usually leads to severe urban inundation and
   damage. As a result, the lag time would be shorter, which may further
   exacerbate the impact of urban flood disasters. The results of this
   study provide insights into managing flood risks, developing urban flood
   prevention strategies, and designing flood prevention measures.}},
