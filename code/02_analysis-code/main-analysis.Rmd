### A Fancy Title 



```{r}
# Load the data and the core directory locations.  This will automatically work things out from globalvariables file.
# Use file.choose() to find the 0_GlobalVariables_Functions.R.  Copy/paste the EXACT address and location in here

address <- "~/Documents/GitHub/systematic-review-flash-floods/code/0_GlobalVariables_Functions.R"
source(address)

```




In order to look at the full text, we wanted to pull a selection of papers into a reference management software like Zotero. 
The easiest way we found, was to create a CSV of the selected DOIs and copy that into the reference manager. 
```{r}

# write.csv(data_bib$DI, "exports/DOIs-all.csv", row.names = data_bib$TI)
social_data_bib <- data_bib[data_bib$Screen2_Social == TRUE, ]
write.csv(social_data_bib$DI, "exports/DOIs-social.csv", row.names = social_data_bib$TI)

```
