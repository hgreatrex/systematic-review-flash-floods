PD  - 
AB  - Floods and droughts are important features of most running water
ecosystems, but the alteration of natural flow regimes by recent human
activities, such as dam building, raises questions related to both
evolution and conservation. Among organisms inhabiting running waters,
what adaptations exist for surviving floods and droughts? How will the
alteration. of the frequency, timing and duration of flow extremes
affect flood- and drought-adapted organisms? How rapidly can populations
evolve in response to altered flow regimes? Here, we identify three
modes of adaptation (life history, behavioral and morphological) that
plants and animals use to survive floods and/or droughts. The mode of
adaptation that an organism has determines its vulnerability to
different kinds of flow regime alteration. The rate of evolution in
response to flow regime alteration remains an open question. Because
humans have now altered the flow regimes of most rivers and many
streams, understanding the link between fitness and flow regime is
crucial for the effective management and restoration of running water
ecosystems.

PD  - 
AB  - Soil plastic and liquid limit are important physical properties
determining soil consistency. They are commonly considered for
engineering and agronomic purposes. However, they also represent a
measure of soil vulnerability to shallow movements, involving limited
soil depths, such as soil slips and debris flow. Such phenomena are
frequently triggered by flash flood events, i.e. extremely intense
rainfall, and enhanced by discontinuities in structure and strength a
long the soil profile.
The objective of this work was to assess soil consistency in the study
area, then estimate soil liquid limit (LL) and plastic limit (PL) from
routine analyses, for Alpine soils vulnerable to severe instability
phenomena (solifluxion, liquefaction, debris flow, surface erosion).
We considered relevant chemical and physical properties and obtained
equations for liquid and plastic limit estimation, for surface and
subsurface samples, with satisfactory goodness of fit. The equations,
involving variables related with texture and aggregation, could help
individuate potential areas showing strong profile discontinuities, and
to rank them according to a preliminary vulnerability scale.

PD  - 
AB  - Egypt was one of the first developing countries in Africa that used
earth observation and remote sensing in various applications since
1970s. It has grown up in the last decades to build its own capacity in
space science and technology that ended up by launching earth
observation satellites. At the same time Egypt continued to develop the
capacity in EO applications and contribute to the national development
plans. In this domain NARSS, the governmental research institute that
lead the EO and space applications has completed many research and
development projects in EO applications in mineral resources
exploration, coastal and marine resources, air quality, water resources
management, food security, etc. This was via operational projects with
the stakeholders and users to ensure sustainability and operation of the
services. For example, NARSS has developed an operational system to
monitor the national crop rice using EO information that capable to
provide the actual land planted with rice and predict the yield. The
system has enabled to provide recommendations for other plots of land
that suitable for rice plantation. In the area of environmental hazards,
many projects on the flash floods and the vulnerability to flash flood
hazards were developed providing decision makers with vulnerability maps
and Atlases on national level. Further details on the EO activities and
future plans at NARSS, Egypt will be presented in this paper.

AB  - A disaster is a result from the combination of hazard, vulnerability and
insufficient Capacity or measures to reduce the potential chances of
risk. Disaster in mining occurs in different ways when poisonous gas
leakage such as methane occurs, Due to fire catch-up, Due to blasts, Due
to earth quack, roof collapse and flash flood. In this project we are
going to incorporate 4 sensors Gas, Light, Temperature and Vibration,
for detecting disasters in mining industries. These sensors are put in a
single package, and can be carried by each miner. By using wireless
communication if any disaster occurs the corresponding sensor will sense
the anomaly and sends the information to control station. The MANET
topology can be used for communication in order to provide uninterrupted
communication.

T1  - Climate impact on drinking water protected areas
A1  - Homolya, Emese

A1  - Selmeczi, Pal
Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Extreme weather conditions have caused difficulties in the Hungarian
drinking water management many times in the past. High demand for
drinking water in dry summer periods and the accompanying reduction in
water resources lead to insufficiency in the availability of a number of
water supplies, therefore causing limitations in water access. In some
other cases, as a result of excessive precipitation, floods and flash
floods evolved over karstic areas, and several water supplies had to be
excluded from operation in order to avoid the risk of infections.
The expected increase in the number of extreme weather conditions and
further possible changes in future climate necessitates the analysis of
the vulnerability of drinking water resources to climate change. Since
95% of the total drinking water supply in Hungary originates from
subsurface layers, significance of groundwater resources is outstanding.
Our work was carried out in the frames of the NAGiS (National Adaptation
Geo-information System) project with the aim to devise a methodology for
the study and determination of the vulnerability of drinking water
supplies to climate. Methods have been chosen according to the CIVAS
(Climate Impact and Vulnerability Assessment Scheme) model that has been
developed in the frame of the international climate research project
CLAVIER (Climate Change and Variability: Impact on Central and Eastern
Europe). The CIVAS model, being based on the combined evaluation of
exposure, sensitivity, impact, adaptability, and vulnerability provides
a unified methodical scheme to quantitative climatic impact assessment.
The investigation involves the analyses of climatic parameters primarily
influencing drinking water supplies and hydrogeological characteristics
of the geological media that significantly determines vulnerability.
Apart from the expected environmental changes,societal and economic
processes have also been taken into account. Climate vulnerability has
been determined on the basis of the distribution and categorization of
the chosen indicators.
Further effects, independent of climate change and caused by
anthropogenic activity, result in similar phenomena. It is often
difficult to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic effects
that occur simultaneously; therefore, anthropogenic activity is
necessary to be taken into account.
In the analyses we used data of two different climate models covering
two separate future time periods. Results on the basis of both climate
model projections suggest that a considerable number of regions in the
area under investigation appear to be vulnerable to climate change to a
certain extent, and vulnerability intensifies to the end of the 21st
century.

AB  - In Sardinia, Italy, karst springs are strategic water resources and
potential hotspots of biodiversity; however, they are understudied, and
their communities remain largely unknown. This study was conducted at Sa
Vena spring (Su Gologone system) to characterize the diatom communities,
to describe their relationships with environmental variables, and to
evaluate the impact of an extreme flash flood. High species richness,
diversity, and evenness were found both in epiphytic and epilithic
assemblages. Statistical analyses showed significant differences between
assemblages from the 2 substrates and in assemblages from the same
substrate. Differences seem due to the stronger impact of seasonal water
level variations and flash flood on macrophytes than on cobbles.
Further, epilithic assemblages showed more stable behavior over time,
both on an annual (higher resistence) and a multiannual (higher
resilience) scale. Alkalinity (p = 0.002) and dissolved oxygen (p =
0.004) explained a significant amount of variance in epiphytic and
epilithic assemblages, respectively, according to RDA analyses; however
BOD5, negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen, can be the most
probable driver of epilithic diatoms. The results suggest the importance
of the proper management and preservation of this biotope, both for the
high biodiversity and potential vulnerability to climate change.

A1  - Delle Rose, Marco

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - In karstic endorheic basins the hydraulic works for runoff regulation,
marshland reclaiming and defense from inundations usually consist of
channels tributary to sinkholes vertically connected to aquifers through
karstic conduits and fractures. The drainage capacity of such basins
reduces as conduits and fractures are progressively clogged by
sediments; thus, floodings may occur during heavy rains. The sinks may
also be utilized to inject treated wastewater underground. This note
concerns the management issues of the Asso Torrent basin (Italy), where
the recharge through water sinks preserves the deep aquifer from
saltwater intrusion. The basin represents a controversial case for which
the sequence of infrastructures produced a critical system, and
nowadays, it is difficult to find a compromise among mitigation of flood
hazard, safeguard of groundwater resources and preservation of human
health. The hydrogeological framework and the hydraulic works executed
in the basin are described, followed by considerations on the
environmental effects of the decision-making process. Finally,
statements concerning alternative measures for the management of the
water resources are given. Management actions conforming to the
Integrated Water Resources Management recommendations fail in the
studied case because there is an intrinsic difficulty to transform the
related concepts to practical and robust solutions.

PD  - 
AB  - Fogo volcano, the largest of the three active volcanoes of Sao Miguel
Island in the Azores, presents a range of hazards, which are related to
non-eruptive processes. Often termed indirect volcano hazards, these are
the focus of the present paper and on Fogo volcano are produced by
interactions between the unstable volcanic edifice and processes
controlled by seismic, hydrothermal, slope instability and hydrological
processes. Many houses, roads and bridges are at risk should significant
earthquake activity occur. Since the island was settled in the 15th
century, earthquakes exceeding IX on the European Macroseismic Scale
(i.e. EMS 98) have struck Sao Miguel in 1522, 1713, 1811 and 1935. An
estimated 45,000 people live within the Fogo District and, without
action to reduce vulnerability, future losses are inevitable. Gases are
emitted from several locations on Fogo, and CO2 is a dangerous gas when
it ponds in depressions. Concentrations of over 15% often lead to
asphyxiation and death, and case studies of the hazards posed by gas
discharge are presented. Sao Miguel has been affected by several
destructive landslides and flash floods in the last five centuries,
triggered by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or periods of heavy
rainfall. A large (X, EMS 98) earthquake in October 1522 generated a
debris flow that buried and completely destroyed the town of Vila Franca
do Campo. About 5,000 people were killed and an area of similar to 4.5
km(2) was covered by millions of cubic metres of debris. Indirect
volcanic hazards are an ever-present threat to people living on the Fogo
Volcano, yet until recently they have been little researched.

T1  - Lightning hazards to human societies in a changing climate
A1  - Yair, Yoav
Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Lightning is a natural hazard, lethal and destructive on short
timescales and with important climatic effects on longer time-scales
(through NOxproduction and forest fire ignition). It is accompanied by
severe weather, hail and flash flooding that often entail significant
economic losses. It also poses threats to aviation safety and to
renewable energy production by wind-turbines, and is known to adversely
affect electric power utilities and transmission lines. Present day
global trends in urbanization, land-use and energy production are mapped
to climate change through several scenarios, relating future
concentrations of green-house gasses in the atmosphere ('Representative
Concentration Pathways' or RCPs; IPCC et al 2013 Climate Change 2013:
The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p 1535) to the adopted energy
policies and international agreements. These scenarios predict a few
degrees of atmospheric warming near Earth surface, which offer
significantly different climatic regimes in many regions on Earth, and
also affect the intensity and frequency of atmospheric natural disasters
(e.g. tropical storms). Although it is hard to precisely predict what
future lightning distributions will look like, the combination of large
metropolitan areas, increased population and a warmer climate almost
guarantee an intensification of the human exposure to lightning hazard.
Were view current trends in population, urbanization and technology
usage and assess their vulnerability to future lightning activity in
different scenarios.

T1  - Trade-offs in linking adaptation and mitigation in the forests of the Congo Basin
A1  - Few, Roger
A1  - Martin, Adrian
A1  - Gross-Camp, Nicole
Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Recent discussions on forests and climate change have highlighted the
potential for conservation of tropical forests to contribute
synergistically to both mitigation (reducing emissions of greenhouse
gases) and adaptation ( increasing capacity to cope with changing
climate conditions). Key mechanisms through which adaptive advantages
might be gained include the potential for forest resources to support
livelihoods in the context of climatic strains on agriculture and the
protection that intact forest ecosystems might provide against
landslides, flash floods and other hazards related to extreme weather.
This paper presents findings from field research with forest communities
in three areas of the Congo Basin in Central Africa, in which the
adaptive role and potential of forests in these respects is critically
analysed. The investigation was carried out through a combination of
structured and semi-structured qualitative techniques within six
villages in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Rwanda. The findings of the
research highlight the need to understand both the limits of synergy,
and the constraints and trade-offs for rural livelihoods that may be
associated with a forest conservation agenda driven by the additional
impetus of carbon sequestration. The search for synergy may be
conceptually laudable, but if forest management actions do not take
account of on-the-ground contexts of constraints and social trade-offs
then the result of those actions risks undermining wider livelihood
resilience.

A1  - Bahlburg, Heinrich
Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - Numerous post-tsunami surveys have been conducted in the last two
decades, especially since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. These studies
have documented a variety of characteristic sedimentary and erosional
features that can be ascribed to known events. Nevertheless, the
question arises whether these structures are just ephemeral or have a
potential to be preserved in the geological record. This review
describes the changes that have affected muddy to sandy siliciclastic
tsunami deposits in Peru. Each of these was surveyed in the first months
after the tsunami: Chimbote (1996), Camand (2001) and Pisco-Paracas
(2007). Here, we describe the changes we observed during re-surveys in
2007 and 2008.
It has long been recognized that onshore tsunami deposits may suffer
from surficial processes, tectonic movements and anthropogenic
alteration. Earthquake-induced uplift or subsidence may subject a
tsunami deposit to erosion or burial, respectively. Quick burial in
rapidly subsiding coastal areas may enhance preservation. Deposits of
the last or most landward-reaching wave may be preferentially preserved
if they escape erosion by subsequent tsunami waves; however, inland
areas are also vulnerable to subaerial reworking, including by wind and
by humans.
The Peruvian examples reviewed here show that the preservation of
arid-coast tsunami deposits depends on interactions that are more
complex that hitherto perceived. These involve sediment type, grain
size, depositional setting, co-seismic movement, bioturbation, winds,
and anthropogenic modification. In one example, all traces of the
tsunami have been removed or reworked by flash floods and ocean waves.
In another example, clasts on a coastal plain from tsunami-backwash
began to be rounded and abraded by eolian sands immediately after the
event. Eolian processes also smoothed and filled tsunami scours. By
contrast, muddy tsunami deposits in certain areas escaped erosion by
wind, probably because of their greater cohesion. In still another
example, 0.5 m of co-seismic uplift was not enough to prevent ocean
waves from removing a tsunami sand sheet that had mantled a coastal
marsh. The buried record of tsunami deposits on modem coasts may
therefore not fully represent the vulnerability of these regions to
tsunamigenic hazards. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PD  - 
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess smallholder farmers'
vulnerability to climate change and variability based on the
socioeconomic and biophysical characteristics of Chiredzi District, a
region that is susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change and
variability.
Design/methodology/approach - Vulnerability was assessed using the
Vulnerability to Resilience and the Climate Vulnerability and Capacity
frameworks.
Findings - The major indicators and drivers of vulnerability were
identified as droughts, flash floods, poor soil fertility and
out-migration leaving female-and child-headed households. From
sensitivity analysis, it was shown that different areas within the
district considered different biophysical and socioeconomic indicators
to climate change and variability. They also considered different
vulnerability indicators to influence the decisions for adaptation to
climate change and variability.
Originality/value - The results of this study indicate that the area and
cropping systems are greatly exposed and are sensitive to climatic
change stimuli, as shown by the decline in main cereal grain yield.
These results also showed that there is a need to define and map local
area vulnerability as a basis to recommend coping and adaptationmeasures
to counter climate change hazards.

AB  - Discriminating DDoS flooding attacks from flash crowds poses a tough
challenge for the network security community. Because of the
vulnerability of the original design of the Internet, attackers can
easily mimic the patterns of legitimate network traffic to fly under the
radar. The existing fingerprint or feature based algorithms are
incapable to detect new attack strategies. In this paper, we aim to
differentiate DDoS attack flows from flash crowds. We are motivated by
the following fact: the attack flows are generated by the same pre-built
program (attack tools), however, flash crowds come from randomly
distributed users all over the Internet. Therefore, the flow similarity
among DDoS attack flows is much stronger than that among flash crowds.
We employ abstract distance metrics, the Jeffrey distance, the Sibson
distance, and the Hellinger distance to measure the similarity among
flows to achieve our goal. We compared the three metrics and found that
the Sibson distance is the most suitable one for our purpose. We apply
our algorithm to the real datasets and the results indicate that the
proposed algorithm can differentiate them with an accuracy around 65%.

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - The rapid development of economic construction and urbanization, highly
dense population, infrastructure and traffic, all have caused a lot of
troubles to the main cities in the Syrian coastal region. In addition,
this region which is located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean
Sea, and among Arabian, African and European Asian plates is suffering
from increasing the number of natural and man-made disasters such as
earthquakes, climate change, flash flooding, and mainly the expected sea
level rise. This rise effect often depends on many elements, such as
seismic hazard, vulnerability, exposure and emergency response and
recovery capability. It is not possible to completely avoid this rise,
but the sufferings can be minimized by creating proper awareness of this
hazard and its impacts through developing an integrated system of the
geographical and environmental data collection and management tools with
simulation and decision tools for risk reduction and assessment. Great
change becomes to integrated management and more to eco-environmental
safety construction, especially to the prevention for disasters
destroyed structure as sea level rise. Therefore, the purpose of this
chapter is to address the need for an integrated disaster risk
management in Syrian coastal zone. This will help to manage the risk of
these disasters and hazards in a more effective manner through linking
up disaster management more closely and consistently with urban planning
and management.

T1  - Vulnerability assessment of Central-East Sardinia (Italy) to extreme rainfall events
A1  - Bodini, A
A1  - Cossu, Q A
Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - In Sardinia (Italy), the highest frequency of extreme events is recorded
in the Central-East area (3-4 events per year). The presence of high and
steep mountains near the sea on the central and south-eastern coast,
causes an East-West precipitation gradient in autumn especially, due to
hot and moist currents coming from Africa. Soil structure and
utilization make this area highly vulnerable to flash flooding and
landslides. The specific purpose of this work is to provide a
description of the heavy rainfall phenomenon on a statistical basis. The
analysis mainly focuses on i) the existence of trends in heavy rainfall
and ii) the characterization of the distribution of extreme events.
First, to study possible trends in extreme events a few indices have
been analyzed by the linear regression test. The analysis has been
carried out at annual and seasonal scales. Then, extreme values analysis
has been carried out by fitting a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)
to the data. As far as trends are concerned, different results are
obtained at the two temporal scales: significant trends are obtained at
the seasonal scale which are masked at the annual scale. By combining
trend analysis and GPD analysis, the vulnerability of the study area to
the occurrence of heavy rainfall has been characterized. Therefore, this
work might support the improvement of land use planning and the
application of suitable prevention systems. Future work will consider
the extension of the analysis to all Sardinia and the application of
statistical methods taking into account the spatial correlation of
extreme events.

AB  - The repercussions of climate change will be felt in various ways
throughout both natural and human systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate
change projections for this region point to a warming trend,
particularly in the inland subtropics; frequent occurrence of extreme
heat events; increasing aridity; and changes in rainfall-with a
particularly pronounced decline in southern Africa and an increase in
East Africa. The region could also experience as much as one meter of
sea-level rise by the end of this century under a 4 A degrees C warming
scenario. Sub-Saharan Africa's already high rates of undernutrition and
infectious disease can be expected to increase compared to a scenario
without climate change. Particularly vulnerable to these climatic
changes are the rainfed agricultural systems on which the livelihoods of
a large proportion of the region's population currently depend. As
agricultural livelihoods become more precarious, the rate of rural-urban
migration may be expected to grow, adding to the already significant
urbanization trend in the region. The movement of people into informal
settlements may expose them to a variety of risks different but no less
serious than those faced in their place of origin, including outbreaks
of infectious disease, flash flooding and food price increases. Impacts
across sectors are likely to amplify the overall effect but remain
little understood.

AB  - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks poses a severe threat to
widely used Internet-based services and applications. Currently, during
in the technology era, the internet is the only real exigent that
delivers a glut of services like businesses, banking, communication,
education, e-commerce, etc. Distributed Denial of Service attack aims to
deny access by legitimate users to shared services or resources. Because
of the vulnerability of the initial style of the web, attackers can
merely mimic the patterns of legitimate network traffic. The prevailing
fingerprint or feature-based methods are not appropriate to detect a
recent DDoS attack. In this paper our goal is to detect a DDoS attack as
well as Flash Crowd using various information distance measures such as
Kullbeck-Leibler, Hellinger and Manhattan distance to measure the flow
similarity among the traffic. Further the detection parameters such as
Detection Rate, Classification Rate, Precision Rate and False Positive
Rate is computed and shows that the Kullbeck-Leibler detection metric
effectively detects the attack as compared to the other two.

AB  - Granada and its metropolitan area lie on the eastern edge of a basin
where the foothills rise into the adjacent Sierra Nevada (3,482 m). On
the west the valley is bordered by several faulted, Quaternary-age
alluvial fans and by dissected terraces of the Genil River. Landscape
evolution from about Tortonian to Pleistocene time is reflected by
relict Quaternary glaciers preserved on a deeply eroded lower Paleozoic
terrain and by terrace remnants and channels resulting from rapid Late
Pleistocene and Holocene fluvial incision. This particular geological,
geomorphic, and active tectonic setting, combined with a Mediterranean
climate under continental influence, and the rapid urban development in
the last 60 years have increased exposure to several natural hazards.
Urban expansion has increased flash-flood and mass-wasting
vulnerability, and seismic risk is similarly increasing with the 1884
Andalusian Earthquake (M 6.3), reflecting the last of several large,
similar to 500-year recurrence temblors that have affected the area
since at least Roman times. Modern Granada and its metropolitan area,
with about a half million inhabitants, are currently increasingly
challenged by the highest levels of exposure to natural hazards, by
strain on traditional society resulting from adapting to the changes
produced by the three decades since the advent of democracy (1978) and
by the consequences of the deep economic crisis.

AB  - Risk management traditionally addresses the control of hazards. However,
this field of research is now more focused on reducing territorial
vulnerability. This requires prior accurate knowledge of this
territorial vulnerability. The present work, applicable to any location,
proposes a GIS-based methodology for vulnerability assessment using the
greater Lyon, France, as a model. The study is based on a spatial
decision-making method that awards priority to vulnerability using
expert judgments. Vulnerability is defined as the combination of the
sensitivity of assets facing hazards and their strategic importance in
the functioning of a city. This approach can be applied to multiple
layers of hazards for a specific envisioned risk.

AB  - Changes of the frequency and intensity of storms, tornadoes, river
floods, flash floods, extreme temperatures and droughts affect the
operability and efficiency as well as the safety the nuclear power
plants. Response to extreme hydroclimatic events depends on the features
of particular hazards, e.g., predictability, possibility and time
available for the protective actions, potential for causing cliff-edge
effects and the possible combinations of events. Effective protection
against the adverse effects of the hydroclimatic extremes can be ensured
by proper definition of the design basis that compensate the potential
changes of the extreme values and their frequencies due to climate
change. In the paper the vulnerability of the nuclear power plants with
respect of hydroclimatic extremes is analysed. The considerations in the
paper are illustrated by the case of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant,
Hungary.

AB  - Climate change in the Canadian north is, and will be, managed by
communities that are already experiencing social, political, economic
and other environmental changes. Hence, there is a need to understand
vulnerability to climate change in the context of multiple
exposure-sensitivities at the community level. This article responds to
this perceived knowledge need based on a case study of the community of
Kugluktuk in Nunavut, Canada. An established approach for vulnerability
assessment is used to identify current climatic and non-climatic
exposure-sensitivities along with their associated contemporary
adaptation strategies. This assessment of current vulnerability is used
as a basis to consider Kugluktuk's possible vulnerability to climatic
change in the future. Current climate-related exposure-sensitivities in
Kugluktuk relate primarily to subsistence harvesting and community
infrastructure. Thinner and less stable ice conditions and unpredictable
weather patterns are making travel and harvesting more dangerous and
some community infrastructure is sensitive to permafrost melt and
extreme weather events (e. g., flash floods). The ability of individuals
and households to adapt to these and other climatic
exposure-sensitivities is influenced by non-climatic factors that
condition adaptive capacity including substance abuse, the erosion of
traditional knowledge and youth suicide. These and other non-climatic
factors often underpin adaptive capacity to deal with and adapt to
changing conditions and must be considered in an assessment of
vulnerability. This research argues that Northern communities are
challenged by multiple exposure-sensitivities-beyond just those posed by
climate-and effective adaptation to climate change requires
consideration if not resolution of socio-economic and other issues in
communities.

PD  - 
AB  - This work examined the plot-scale differences in soil-water retention
caused by wildfire in the area of the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire in the
Colorado Front Range, United States. We measured soil-water retention
curves on intact cores and repacked samples, soil particle-size
distributions, and organic matter content. Estimates were also made of
plant-available water based on the soil-water retention curves.
Parameters for use in soil-hydraulic property models were estimated;
these parameters can be used in unsaturated flow modeling for comparing
burned and unburned watersheds. The primary driver for measured
differences in soil-water retention in burned and unburned soils was
organic matter content and not soil-particle size distribution. The
tendency for unburned south-facing soils to have greater organic matter
content than unburned north-facing soils in this field area may explain
why unburned south-facing soils had greater soil-water retention than
unburned north-facing soils. Our results suggest that high-severity
wildfire can ``homogenize{''} soil-water retention across the landscape
by erasing soil-water retention differences resulting from organic
matter content, which for this site may be affected by slope aspect.
This homogenization could have important implications for ecohydrology
and plant succession/recovery in burned areas, which could be a factor
in dictating the window of vulnerability of the landscape to flash
floods and erosion that are a common consequence of wildfire. Citation:

AB  - The current Internet infrastructure has very few built-in protection
mechanisms, and is therefore vulnerable to attacks and failures. In
particular, recent events have illustrated the Internet's vulnerability
to both denial of service (DoS) attacks and flash crowds in which one or
more links in the network (or servers at the edge of the network) become
severely congested. In both DoS attacks and flash crowds the congestion
is due neither to a single flow, nor to a general increase in traffic,
but to a well-defined subset of the traffic - an aggregate. This paper
proposes mechanisms for detecting and controlling such high bandwidth
aggregates. Our design involves both a local mechanism for detecting and
controlling an aggregate at a single router, and a cooperative pushback
mechanism in which a router can ask upstream routers to control an
aggregate. While certainly not a panacea, these mechanisms could provide
some needed relief from flash crowds and flooding-style DoS attacks. The
presentation in this paper is a first step towards a more rigorous
evaluation of these mechanisms.

T1  - Overloading Vulnerability of VoIP Networks
A1  - Sengar, Hemant

PD  - 
AB  - Internet is vulnerable to overloading caused by flash crowds and
distributed denial-of-service (DDos) attacks. Recently voice over IP
(VoIP), an Internet-based service is experiencing a phenomenal growth.
As its deployment spreads, VoIP systems are likely to become attack
targets, of which flooding lists high, perhaps due to its simplicity and
the abundance of tool support The DDoS attacks and flash crowds degrade
the performance of call processing server to the point where it becomes
sluggish and even unresponsive. The network administrator's dilemma is
that how to give a differential treatment to malicious and legitimate
call requests that differ in intent. but not in content.
In this paper, we show that DDoS attacks and flash crowds, while similar
in the message structure and the number. of INVITES they generate,
exhibit different traffic patterns and hence making them
distinguishable. We also introduce a new entropy-based approach to
detect those DDoS attacks that masquerade as flash crowds. Our approach
ie based on an observation that the creation of malicious sessions has
certain effects on entropy of the call durations; hence, a change in the
entropy provides an important clue. for mimicry attack detection. As an
overloading preventive measure, we exploit the SIP protocol's inbuilt
reliability mechanism and exponential backoff timer values to regulate
and distinguish legitimates call requests from the spoofed ones.

AB  - This study was carried out in the Xujiawan watershed in Sichuan
Province, China. The area is characterized by easy weathering of bedrock
(sedimentary sandstone and shale) and vulnerability to erosion due to
coarse soil texture and weak soil structure. The objective of this study
was to understand the dynamics of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses
during typical storm events. The results showed that runoff generation
was sudden and ephemeral, giving rise to flash floods with sharp, narrow
hydrographs and short time lags in this type of agricultural ecosystems.
The time lag effect of runoff formation depended on soil conditions
before storm events. Suspended solids (SS) concentration peaks occurred
at the beginning of the storm flow and decreased as rainfall progressed.
Meanwhile, SS losses increased at the beginning of runoff flow, then
decreased due to flow volume change. Concentrations of NO3--N were four
times higher than NH4+-N in runoff. NO3--N concentrations first
decreased as runoff volume increased until reaching relatively low
concentrations, then increased again as runoff volume decreased. Both
NH4+-N and dissolved phosphorus (DP) in runoff remained at low
concentrations with a small magnitude of variation. Suspended
particulate nitrogen (SN) was the dominant N form. Losses of NO3--N were
higher than NH4+-N in the dissolved nitrogen (DN). Suspended particulate
nitrogen losses were several times higher than DN in the early period of
runoff formation, but the ratio of SN/DN decreased gradually as rainfall
progressed, and by the end of the storm event the rate was lower than 1,
indicating DN took the main form after the early physical flush. In the
early period of storm events, suspended particulate phosphorus (SP)/DP
was above 70 and decreased as rainfall progressed, but remained higher
than 1, which showed that SP was the main form of P loss. The transport
of N, and particularly P, was intimately linked to sediment in the
runoff, indicating an obvious soil erosion-associated nutrient
transport, especially in relation to P loss. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

AB  - This paper contributes to an enhanced understanding of present climatic
conditions, observed climate trends and regional climate vulnerability
of the Bhutan Himalayas. Bhutan's complex, often high-altitude terrain
and the severe impact of the Indian summer monsoon leads to a strong
exposure of the countries' key economic sectors (agriculture, forestry,
hydropower generation and tourism) to climatic changes. Climate change
also threatens Bhutan's vast biodiversity and increases the likelihood
of natural hazards (e.g. glacier lake outburst floods, flash floods,
droughts and forest fires). A better understanding of Bhutan's climate
and its variability, as well as observed and possible climate impacts,
will help in improving the handling of regional social, economic and
ecologic challenges not limited to the Himalayas. Only a few
climatological studies exist for the eastern Himalayas. They mainly
focus on adaptation to immediate threats by glacier lake outbursts. In
contrast, this paper (1) investigates the average spatial and
inner-annual diversity of the air temperature regime of Bhutan, based on
local meteorological observations, (2) discusses past temperature
variability, based on global datasets, and (3) relates effects of
observed warming to water availability, hydropower development, natural
hazards, forests, biodiversity, agriculture, human health and tourism in
the Bhutan Himalayas. Results indicate a large spatial and temporal
temperature variability within Bhutan and considerably increasing
temperatures especially over recent decades. Implications of regional
climatic changes on various socio-economic sectors and possible
adaptation efforts are discussed.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Climate change was appeared as a phenomenon since the early 19th
Century, and since then non serious international commitment was
conducted to reduce its rapid impacts, however after 1980th many
countries made extreme efforts to document and understand climate change
complex impacts and how to deal with it, but those efforts marked by
successes and failures within a very uneven pace. Nowadays many
(developed) countries adopted the idea of planning the city for climate
change (In-spite of inherent limitations to predictive capacity and
uncertainty) that guarantee providing the city not only with the
necessary Actions and precautions that insure the city resiliency and
inhabitants' safety, but also contribute to quality of life to have
liveable cities.
However, many of developing countries have another point of view in
considering this issue, as they don't take climate change issue into
consideration while planning for its local/national development Agenda,
despite most of them are expose to natural disasters/Hazards (such as
tsunamis, floods, flash floods or excessive increase in temperature),
depending on the Reaction strategy and short-term Adaptation plans to
confront such disasters or at least minimize their impacts. As they
believe that even if they accept to conduct climate change action plan;
it may represent extreme financial burden on its Local/National budget
or it may affect the NGOs/international fund for development.
This paper aims to reveal this conflict by explain the climate change
paradigm and how/why it transformed from just a phenomenon to Action
plan. Followed by identifying the climate change planning cycle and how
to make climate change action plan and the challenges that the
developing countries faces in planning for climate change and how we
could support their initiatives. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

T1  - Risk and the neoliberal state: Why post-Mitch lessons didn't reduce El Salvador's earthquake losses
A1  - Wisner, B
Y1  - 2001///
PD  - 
AB  - Although El Salvador suffered light losses from Hurricane Mitch in 1998,
it benefited from the increased international aid and encouragement for
advance planning, especially mitigation and prevention interventions.
Thus, one would have supposed, El Salvador would have been in a very
advantageous position, able more easily than its economically crippled
neighbours, Honduras and Nicaragua, to implement the `lessons of Mitch'.
A review of the recovery plan tabled by the El Salvador government
following the earthquakes of early 2001 shows that despite the rhetoric
in favour of `learning the lessons of Mitch, very little mitigation and
prevention had actually been put in place between the hurricane (1998)
and the earthquakes (2001). The recovery plan is analysed in terms of
the degree to which it deals with root causes of disaster vulnerability,
namely, the economic and political marginality of much of the population
and environmental degradation. An explanation for the failure to
implement mitigation and preventive actions is traced to the adherence
by the government of El Salvador to an extreme form of neoliberal, free
market ideology, and the deep fissures and mistrust in a country that
follow a long and bloody civil war.

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Rajasthan, with its climate ranging from arid to semi-arid to sub-humid,
and rapidly depleting natural resources, is already experiencing the
effects of climate change. The region's climate is projected to become
harsher, with increased average temperatures, intensity of rainfall
events, and increased variability in space & time of monsoon rains
being consistently projected for the region. Without action in the form
of adaptation of social, human, economic, and natural resource
management systems, these weather changes are predicted to result in
decreasing surface and ground water availability, flash floods,
degradation of soil resources, decrease in crop yields, greater
vulnerability to crop pest outbreaks, and declines in forest and
pastureland ecosystem goods and services, thus rendering agricultural
and herding communities extremely vulnerable to weather related losses
of life, livelihood, and food security.
In Rajasthan, government is focussing for sustainable development and
climate change adaptation by finding and administering alternative
methods to deal with issues of poverty and environmental degradation in
context of linkage between livelihood and the immediate environment of
the people. The livelihoods of the rural poor are directly dependent on
environmental resources like land, water, forests and are vulnerable to
weather and climate variability. Climate change affects every aspect of
society, environment and economy requiring adjustments in behaviour,
livelihoods, infrastructure, laws, policies and institutions in response
to experienced based expected climatic events. However, it was found
that local coping strategies and traditional knowledge need to be used
in synergy with government and local interventions. Solutions must be
integrated to address the interrelationships between water, agriculture,
forests and pastures, livestock. Finally, there is great potential for
existing policies and schemes to be employed synergistically towards
building true adaptive capacity for the rural communities. However,
adapting to climate change will entail adjustments and implementation at
every level from community to national and international.

PD  - 
AB  - Hydraulic structures constitute the most vulnerable elements of
transportation infrastructure. Recent increases in precipitation have
resulted in severe and more frequent flash flooding incidents. This has
put bridges over waterways at higher risk of failure due to scour. This
study presents a new sensor for measuring scour depth variation and
sediment deposition processes in the vicinity of the foundations to
underpin systems for early warning of impending structural failure. The
monitoring system consists of a probe with integrated electromagnetic
sensors designed to detect changes in the dielectric permittivity of the
surrounding bridge foundation. The probe is equipped with a wireless
interface and was evaluated to assess its ability to detect scour and
sediment deposition in various soil types and under temperature and
water salinity conditions that would commonly occur in a practical
installation environment. A novel methodology is also developed enabling
discrimination between in situ and re-deposited sediment delivering
vital information about the load bearing capacity of the foundation. The
experimental approach was validated using `static' scour simulations and
real-time open channel flume experiments. Results indicate that the
sensor is highly sensitive to underwater bed level variations and can
provide an economical and accurate structural health monitoring
alternative to existing instruments.

intensity as a function of duration and return period, and they are
significant for water resources planning, as well as for the design of
hydraulic constructions and structures. In this study, scaling
properties of extreme rainfall are examined to establish the scaling
behavior of statistical non-central moment over different durations. IDF
curves and equations are set up for all stations by using the parameter
obtained from scaling behavior, the location and scale parameters mu 24
and sigma 24 of the Gumbel distribution (EVI) sample of annual maximum
1440 min rainfall data. In another hand, we have established the IDF
curves for ten selected rain gauge stations in the Northern (Oueme
Valley) parts of Benin Republic, West Africa by using the simple scaling
approach. Analysis of rainfall intensities (5 min and 1440 min rainfall
data) from the ten rainfall stations shows that rainfall in north-Benin
displays scales invariance property from 5 min to 1440 min. For time
scaling, the statistical properties of rainfall follow the hypothesis of
simple scaling. Therefore, the simple scaling model applies to the
rainfall in (Oueme Valley). Hence, the simple scaling model is thought
to be a viable approach to estimate IDF curves of hourly and sub-hourly
rainfall form rainfall projections. The obtained scaling exponents are
less than 1 and range from 0.23 to 0.59. The empirical model shows that
the scaling procedure is a good estimator as it is more efficient and
gives more accurate estimates compared with the observed rainfall than
the traditional method which only consists the Gumbel model in all
stations for lower return periods (T<5 years) but not for higher return
periods.

AB  - The first renewable hydrogen refuelling station in China is under
development for fuel cell vehicles. A safety study is conducted for the
hydrogen station that consists of hybrid solar and wind power,
integrated hydrogen generation and tube trailer delivery, hydrogen
compression, hydrogen storage, and hydrogen filling system. Hazards
associated with hydrogen systems are identified and typical failure
scenarios are analyzed in terms of event probabilities and consequences
severities. Safety measures and emergency responses are discussed.
Results show that compressors are the major risk contributor and
additional safety measures are required to reduce the hazards from the
failure of compressors. Releases of hydrogen can result in either jet
fire or flash fire depending on the time of ignition. From the
consequence perspective, jet flame length determines the longest lethal
distances and flash fire leads to the longest harm distances. To
mitigate the risk of catastrophic tank rupture in fire events, all tanks
must be cooled with flooding quantities of water. A safety distance of 6
m from the compressors would be appropriate during siting and location
decision process, from the risk perspective. However, in the worst-case
scenarios, a setback perimeter of 50 m is suggested to keep the public
away from the accident scene. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

AB  - The development of the Australian Tsunami Warning System (ATWS) was in
recognition of the fact that the Australian coastline faces some 8000 km
of active tectonic plate boundary capable of generating a tsunami that
could reach Australia in two to four hours. The work reported in this
paper complements an earlier questionnaire study (Paton, Frandsen &
Johnston 2010) with detailed interview data to inform understanding of
respondents' awareness of tsunami risk and their willingness (or lack
of) to respond to a rare but possible natural hazard. A belief that no
tsunami events had occurred in Australia (at least since colonial times)
and that major causes (e.g. seismic and volcanic) were absent, supported
the view of participants that tsunami is a non-existent or a very
low-probability hazard for Australia. This view was reinforced by the
lack of discussion of tsunami by government or in the media. The ensuing
sense of `risk rejection' resulted in respondents believing that no
resources or effort should be directed to tsunami risk reduction. The
data raises the possibility that the ATWS may not be fully effective
unless action is taken to increase tsunami risk acceptance and
readiness. Recommendations for doing so draw on participant discussions
of how to localise risk reduction activities. Their suggestions for
increasing tsunami readiness in coastal communities included integrating
it with community-based, localised discussions around frequent flash
floods, coastal storms, bushfires and climate change hazards. These
concepts are discussed, as well as the use of local volunteer resources
to develop preparedness activities.

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - The study focused on the seepage of uranium from unlined tailing dams
into the alluvial aquifer in the Gawib River floodplain in Namibia where
the region solely relies on groundwater for its economic activities as a
result of arid climatic condition. The study reviewed previous works
besides water sample collection and analyses for major ions, metals and
environmental isotopes in addition to field tests on physico-chemical
parameters (pH, Electrical Conductivity, Redox and T). Estimation of
seepage velocity (true velocity of groundwater flow) has been conducted
in order to understand the extent of radioactive plume transport. The
hydrochemistry, stable isotopes and tritium results show that there is
uranium contamination from the unlined uranium tailings in the Gawib
shallow aquifer system which suggests high permeability of the alluvial
aquifer facilitating groundwater flow in the arid region. The
radioactive contaminants could spread into the deeper aquifer system
through the major structures such as joints and faults. The
contamination plume could also spread downstream into the Swakop River
unless serious interventions are employed. There is also a very high
risk of the plume to reach the Atlantic Ocean through seasonal flash
floods that occurs in the area.

T1  - An Investigation of Local and National NWS Warning Outbreaks for Severe Convective Events
A1  - Bruick, Zachary S
A1  - Karstens, Christopher D
Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - The National Weather Service (NWS) is charged with the responsibility of
issuing severe weather warnings for the public whenever life and
property may be in danger. During severe convective events, the NWS
issues severe thunderstorm, tornado, and flash flood warnings. This
study solely examines severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings conveying
threats for wind, hail, and tornadoes.
Since 1 October 2007, the NWS has issued storm-based warnings, which
cover smaller areas than the previous county-based system. Situational
awareness and appropriate staffing levels are necessary to make warning
operations successful within a NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO). If
storm coverage and severity are great enough, warning outbreaks can
occur in which an NWS WFO has an anomalously high number of warnings
valid at the same time-covering large portions of their areas of
responsibility. In the top cases, there have been >= 10 warnings in
effect at the same time within a county warning area, and >= 30 across
the country.
A dichotomy exists between the environments that are associated with
local and national tornado warning and severe thunderstorm warning
outbreaks. Tornado warning outbreaks occur with high-end supercellular
storm modes in high convective available potential energy (CAPE) and
shear profiles. These events are often identified by the Storm
Prediction Center as moderate or high risk with particularly dangerous
situation tornado watches issued. Meanwhile, severe thunderstorm warning
outbreaks transpire in mostly slight or enhanced risk areas with modest
CAPE and low shear, which produce mainly pulse and linear thunderstorms.
Verification statistics of these warnings indicate poorer performance
compared to national averages-whether on local or national scales-with
lower critical success index scores and higher false alarm ratios,
although most events are warned during these outbreaks.

PD  - 
AB  - To mitigate against future changes to estuaries such as water quality,
catchment and estuary models can be coupled to simulate the transport of
harmful pathogenic viruses, pollutants and nutrients from their
terrestrial sources, through the estuary and to the coast. To predict
future changes to estuaries, daily mean river flow projections are
typically used. We show that this approach cannot resolve higher
frequency discharge events that have large impacts to estuarine
dilution, contamination and recovery for two contrasting estuaries. We
therefore characterise sub-daily scale flow variability and propagate
this through an estuary model to provide robust estimates of impacts for
the future.
River flow data (35-year records at 15-min sampling) were used to
characterise variabilities in storm hydrograph shapes and simulate the
estuarine response. In particular, we modelled a fast-responding
catchment-estuary system (Conwy, UK), where the natural variability in
hydrograph shapes generated large variability in estuarine circulation
that was not captured when using daily-averaged river forcing. In the
extreme, the freshwater plume from a `flash' flood (lasting <12 h) was
underestimated by up to 100% - and the response to nutrient loading was
underestimated further still. A model of a slower-responding system
(Humber, UK), where hydrographs typically last 2-4 days, showed less
variability in estuarine circulation and good approximation with
daily-averaged flow forcing. Our result has implications for entire
system impact modelling; when we determine future changes to estuaries,
some systems will need higher resolution future river flow estimates.

AB  - The risks of flooding in rice production include losses that can affect
some 13 million ha of rice lands in Southeast Asia. This study
integrated social and gender perspectives into the varietal evaluation
process to contribute to planned faster uptake of submergence-tolerant
rice (Sub1) varieties. In this study, the participatory varietal
selection (PVS) process was used in eliciting male and female farmers'
opinions with respect to selecting popular varieties with the SUB1 gene
introgressed, for added tolerance of flash floods of up to two weeks.
Fifteen Sub1 varieties and the farmers' local check were tested under
the PVS researcher-managed (PVS-RM) trials, which involved farmers'
preference analysis (PA). The farmers tested the pre-selected lines with
the SUB1 gene in their own fields to further evaluate their performance
under varying conditions. During flooding, farmers experienced lower
production depending on water depth, timing with respect to rice growth
stage, duration, frequency of occurrence and quality. On-farm PA results
showed wide variability in the performance of the Sub1 varieties
compared with local popular varieties. This implies the need for further
testing of pre-released lines in terms of adaptability and the
continuous development of rice genotypes for varying flood-prone rice
ecosystems. Women are as knowledgeable as men because of the significant
roles they play in rice production and food preparation. Moreover,
farmers and breeders have almost the same criteria in choosing the best
performing rice lines. Sensory tests revealed the eating and cooking
qualities important to farmers. The findings of this study can provide
feedback to breeding programmes to ensure a greater likelihood of
adoption and ultimately increasing rice productivity in
submergence-prone rice areas.

PD  - 
AB  - Dam failure causes catastrophic flooding and immense damage downstream.
There are many factors that affect the magnitude of such flash floods.
In this study the influence of reservoir side slopes on dam-break
hydrographs and water levels was investigated using experimental and
numerical methods. Ideal trapezoidal reservoirs with different side
angles varying from 30 degrees to 90 degrees were examined in the
laboratory, while the reservoir capacity and breach cross section were
considered to be the same. Due to the experimental limitations for
measuring the flow parameters at any required points, 3D-numerical
modeling was used. The results showed that the dam-break flood from the
reservoir with a 30 degrees side slope has the highest peak-discharge,
the sharpest rising and recession limbs of the hydrograph, and the
earliest maximum water level and discharge. Based on the results, in
view of risk assessment, the reservoirs with lower side slopes are
expected to have more potential risk for damage in the event of dam
break.

AB  - The management of stormwater runoff via distributed green
infrastructures delivers a number of environmental services that go
beyond the reduction of flood risk, which has been the focus of
conventional stormwater systems. Not all of these services may be
equally valued by the public, however. This paper estimates households'
willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements in water security, stream
health, recreational and amenity values, as well as reduction in flood
risk and urban heat island effect. We use data from nearly 1000 personal
interviews with residential homeowners in Melbourne and Sydney,
Australia. Our results suggest that the WTP for the highest levels of
all environmental services is A$799 per household per year. WTP is
mainly driven by residents valuing improvements in local stream health,
exemptions in water restrictions, the prevention of flash flooding, and
decreased peak urban temperatures respectively at A$297, A$244, A$104
and A$65 per year. We further conduct a benefit transfer analysis and
find that the WTP and compensating surplus are not significantly
different between the study areas. Our findings provide additional
support that stormwater management via green infrastructures have large
nonmarket benefits and that, under certain conditions, benefit values
can be transferred to different locations.

PD  - 
AB  - A common misconception is that wilderness adventure travel is risky
owing to the nature of the objective dangers that are encountered, such
as avalanches, rock falls, flash floods, failure of technical equipment
and so forth. However, when one critically examines the proximal causes
of wilderness accidents, even those caused by such `objective dangers',
it is apparent that many are due to `human factors' or nontechnical
skills. These are broadly defined as the continuous process of
identifying and avoiding the activities, interactions and decisions that
may jeopardise safe and effective response to adverse events. Objective
dangers and adverse events are unavoidable, but the response to them is
governed by how team dynamics, leadership and followership modes,
situational awareness and experience may mitigate these risks or manage
their consequences effectively. On the other hand, ignoring human
factors during wilderness travel is predictive of wilderness accidents.
This article outlines how an awareness of human factors may be used to
reduce the risks of adventure travel significantly.

AB  - The uncertainty in a hydrological model, due to its structure or
implemented input parameters, affects the accuracy of simulations that
are usually used for important applications such as drought predictions,
flood risk assessment, irrigation scheduling, ground water recharge and
contamination. Several models describing soil infiltration processes
have been developed. Some are analytical, while others implement
numerical solutions of the Richards' equation. The objective of this
work was to assess the impact of infiltration process modeling on soil
water content simulations. For this study, different infiltration models
were included within FEST-WB (Flash Flood Event-based
Spatially-distributed rainfall-runoff Transformations-Water Balance)
distributed hydrological model (SCS-CN, Green and Ampt, Philip and Ross
solution). Performances of implemented infiltration models in simulating
soil water content were evaluated against observations acquired in the
experimental site located in a maize field in northern Italy. Soil water
content was monitored together with continuous measurements of
meteorological data. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the
most important parameters governing infiltration process in the
different models tested. A comparison of soil water content simulations
show that Ross solution allowed the description of soil moisture
variation along the vertical, but simpler lumped models provide
sufficient accuracy when properly calibrated.

A1  - Ebel, Brian A

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Hydrologic recovery after wildfire is critical for restoring the
ecosystem services of protecting of human lives and infrastructure from
hazards and delivering water supply of sufficient quality and quantity.
Recovery of soil-hydraulic properties, such as field-saturated hydraulic
conductivity (K-fs), is a key factor for assessing the duration of
watershed-scale flash flood and debris flow risks after wildfire.
Despite the crucial role of K-fs in parameterizing numerical hydrologic
models to predict the magnitude of postwildfire run-off and erosion,
existing quantitative relations to predict K-fs recovery with time since
wildfire are lacking. Here, we conduct meta-analyses of 5 datasets from
the literature that measure or estimate K-fs with time since wildfire
for longer than 3-year duration. The meta-analyses focus on fitting 2
quantitative relations (linear and non-linear logistic) to explain
trends in K-fs temporal recovery. The 2 relations adequately described
temporal recovery except for 1 site where macropore flow dominated
infiltration and K-fs recovery. This work also suggests that K-fs can
have low hydrologic resistance (large postfire changes), and moderate to
high hydrologic stability (recovery time relative to disturbance
recurrence interval) and resilience (recovery of hydrologic function and
provision of ecosystem services). Future K-fs relations could more
explicitly incorporate processes such as soil-water repellency, ground
cover and soil structure regeneration, macropore recovery, and
vegetation regrowth.

AB  - Historical in situ sub-daily rainfall observations are essential for the
understanding of short-duration rainfall extremes but records are
typically not readily accessible and data are often subject to errors
and inhomogeneities. Furthermore, these events are poorly quantified in
projections of future climate change making adaptation to the risk of
flash flooding problematic. Consequently, knowledge of the processes
contributing to intense, short-duration rainfall is less complete
compared with those on daily timescales. The INTENSE project is
addressing this global challenge by undertaking a data collection
initiative that is coupled with advances in high-resolution climate
modelling to better understand key processes and likely future change.
The project has so far acquired data from over 23 000 rain gauges for
its global sub-daily rainfall dataset (GSDR) and has provided evidence
of an intensification of hourly extremes over the US. Studies of these
observations, combined with model simulations, will continue to advance
our understanding of the role of local-scale thermodynamics and
large-scale atmospheric circulation in the generation of these events
and how these might change in the future.

AB  - Wildland fire is a major disturbance promoting landscape changes and
triggering desertification processes in the Northern Mediterranean
basin. Addressing that issue in the long term requires both fire
prevention and pot-fire restoration measures. Post-fire restoration
should mitigate ecosystem degradation, and improve ecosystem
regeneration rate and quality.
The impact of wildfires is especially acute in the transition between
semi-arid and dry subhumid climates, where dry vegetation fuels
facilitate fire spread and water shortage limits post-fire regeneration.
In addition, the occurrence of torrential rains produces a high risk of
post-fire flash-floods, especially in autumn after summer fires.
The major objectives of post-fire restoration are soil and water
conservation and increasing ecosystem resistance and resilience in front
of fire. Post-fire restoration strategies are defined according to the
degradation stage of the ecosystems and the recovery capacity of
vegetation. Plant cover regeneration rate highly influence post-fire
soil erosion and flooding risk. The abundance of woody resprouters is
recognized in eastern Spain as a critical factor to ensure an efficient
recovery of plant cover after fire.
Post-fire restoration planning is addressed taking into account
vegetation fragility to wildfires, together with soil erosion risk and
soil moisture availability (physical features). Vegetation fragility is
defined both in relation to spontaneous regeneration capacity of plant
cover and in relation to the ability of keystone woody species topersist
after fire. A synthetic indicator to asses wildland protection and
restoration priorities in relation to wildland fires is developed by
combining vegetation fragility and physical layers in a GIS.

PD  - 
AB  - The selection of the disposal site is probably the most important step
in the development of solid waste management. In site selection, geology
plays a determining role. This study evaluates the characteristics of
the environment on the basis of the geological, hydrogeological and
geo-engineering properties of the solid waste site of the Sivas city,
Turkey. The area is underlain by the Oligocene-Miocene rocks which have
limited aquifer properties. Thin Quaternary alluvium and soil cover
overlie the Oligo-Miocene rocks, which are represented as well graded
sand and inorganic silt of low plasticity. The Quaternary alluvium and
soil cover are classified as inorganic clays having a low plasticity and
the permeability varies from 1.2x10(-6) to 3.11x10(-6) m/s. These values
are much higher than 1x10(-8) m/s, which is accepted for waste disposal
standards. Seepage waters have a potential to pollute the ground water
and the Kizilirmak River, which is 500 m to the southwest of the waste
disposal area and because the disposal site is close to the river, the
potential for flash flooding poses a high pollution risk. The waste
disposal area must be covered by clay layers or an impervious artificial
membrane. In addition, seepage must be controlled and removed from the
site.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of
extreme climate events. Tests on empirical data of theory-based
predictions on the consequences of extreme climate events are thus
necessary to understand the adaptive potential of species and the
overarching risks associated with all aspects of climate change. We
tested predictions on the genetic and life-history consequences of
extreme climate events in two populations of marble trout Salmo
marmoratus that have experienced severe demographic bottlenecks due to
flash floods. We combined long-term field and genotyping data with
pedigree reconstruction in a theory-based framework. Our results show
that after flash floods, reproduction occurred at a younger age in one
population. In both populations, we found the highest reproductive
variance in the first cohort born after the floods due to a combination
of fewer parents and higher early survival of offspring. A small number
of parents allowed for demographic recovery after the floods, but the
genetic bottleneck further reduced genetic diversity in both
populations. Our results also elucidate some of the mechanisms
responsible for a greater prevalence of faster life histories after the
extreme event.

AB  - Wetlands provide a range of ecosystem services such as drought
resistance, flood resistance, nutrient deposition, biodiversity, etc.
This study presents a new multi-criteria, ecosystems service
value-driven method to drive the optimal placement of restored wetlands
in terms of maximizing selected ecosystem services which a wetland can
provide or affect. We aim to answer two questions: 1) which of the
ecosystem services indicators defines the placement of wetlands today?
2) Based on the ecosystem services indicator assessment, what are the
recommendations for future selection of catchments for potential wetland
reconstruction (i.e. restoration)?
Five key ecosystem services indicators produced or affected by wetlands
in Denmark were mapped (recreational potential, biodiversity, nitrogen
mitigation potential, inverse land rent, and flash-flood risk). These
services were compared to current placements of wetlands. Furthermore,
scenario testing and hotspot analysis were combined to provide future
recommendations for optimal placements of wetlands. The scenarios
investigated were Climate Adaptation and Protection of Aquatic
Environment, Land-Based Economy, and Rich Nature. Based on these
scenarios, the most suitable areas for wetland reconstruction were
mapped, taking both the scenarios and attached weightings of ecosystem
services indicators into account.
According to statistical results current reconstructed wetlands are
situated in catchments with lower biodiversity, higher nitrogen
mitigation potential, higher land rent (i.e. agricultural intensive
areas), and to some extent higher flash flood risk compared to the
median of catchments with wetlands. Hence, recreation potential, high
biodiversity, and low land rent has not been prioritized. 35 out of the
3023 catchments investigated were identified with an especially high
suitability when optimizing all scenarios. This coincides with a high
suitability around peri-urban and urban areas and near natural areas,
hence capturing both supply and demand services. Of the 35 identified
catchments with potentially high suitability, only 2 actually hold a
presently reconstructed wetland. This indicates a prior placement with
almost no consideration of maximizing ecosystem services benefits.
We recommend a systematic approach, such as the ecosystem service
value-driven method demonstrated in the present case study, to target
more services and improve the overall benefit from wetlands. This
approach seeks to inform decision makers of synergies in the landscape,
which is likely to transcend future policy implementations. (C) 2016

AB  - The effects on coastal lagoons of floods resulting from intense rainfall
need to be assessed using a multi-isciplinary approach, able to describe
in real time the occurrence of changes in sediment quality, anticipating
risk situations. In the present study the effectiveness as pre-screening
tool of the MOT-test, an innovative bioassay that uses sperm motility as
endpoint, has been evaluated; its response has been compared with the
sediment chemical characterization, in order to determine the effects of
a flood event occurred in the Varano lagoon, a poorly anthropized
Mediterranean coastal lagoon.
The MOT-test effect percentages ranged from 10% to 30%, fully
reflecting data from chemical analyses. Organic pollutants showed
concentrations always below the critical levels. The highest metal
values were found in the south-eastern area; however, only for few
metals (mainly Cd), and in few sites, they reached the limits defined by
the sediment quality guidelines; consistently, these sites are located
in the area where a higher stressors' impact was expected and the
highest MOT-test effect percentages were recorded.
In conclusion, even if results exclude the occurrence of serious
contamination events as a consequence of the flood, the runoff resulting
from the intense rainfall event has caused a pollutant load in the
lagoon, consistent with the localization of the main anthropogenic
activities in the catchment area.
Moreover, preliminary data indicate the validity of the approach adopted
for the post-flood quality assessment, proving the usefulness of the
MOT-test as early-screening tool in the case of extreme events.

T1  - Field Performance of Unvented Cathedralized (UC) Attics in the USA
A1  - Rudd, Armin
Y1  - 2005///
PD  - 
AB  - This article reports on field experience of unvented cathedralized (UC)
attics in several environments in the United States. Traditionally, in
some regions of the country, because of high water tables or the risk of
flash flooding and lower cost, slab on grade construction is a preferred
mode of construction. Mechanical equipment for air conditioning and
distribution ducts are usually located in the attic spaces to conserve
space. Conventional construction involves providing insulation on the
floor of the attic and venting the attic space to the outside. The loss
in efficiency in operation of the equipment and through duct leakage is
no longer sustainable. Insulating the attic roof itself and blocking of
ventilation to the outside transfers the air and thermal energy controls
from the boundary with the living space to the plane of the roof. The
air distribution systems now fall within conditioned space, which
increases their efficiency, durability, and maintainability.
While design criteria vary for different climatic regions, UC attics can
be insulated in various ways and by using different vapor diffusion
resistance strategies of the roof assemblies depending on the climate.
The field data presented in this article include measured temperature of
asphalt shingles, and thermal and moisture conditions of attic spaces
and roof sheathing, as well as air leakage rates. This is of interest
for determining probable roofing durability. A more complete
understanding of the hygrothermal performance of the assemblies was
gained through these measurements.

PD  - 
AB  - Bhutan has taken the initiative in developing a comprehensive guideline
on disaster risk preparedness and management in response to several
minor disasters, namely earthquakes and flash floods in the country
during the last couple of years. It is now widely accepted that the
psychological symptoms of trauma resulting from devastation to lives and
livelihood of affected people remain much longer and sometimes
throughout their entire life span unless taken care of. Therefore, it is
important to include psychosocial components of mental health protection
and treatment of the affected persons in disaster risk preparedness and
management to make it a comprehensive package. A four-tier system of
mental health intervention and counselling has been proposed in line
with the existing healthcare system and resources available in the
country to make it sustainable. At the core of this programme is the
mobilizing and training of volunteers from the community on psychosocial
intervention, counselling and rehabilitation, backed up by three layers
of trained health workers and mental health professionals.

AB  - The influence of flash flood events on the input and distribution of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs), and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) in surface sediments
from the Mar Menor lagoon were characterized in this study. These
contaminants were analyzed in surface water samples collected during two
flash flood events in the main surface watercourse which flow into the
Mar Menor lagoon. Surface sediments were sampled semiannually before and
after flash flood events. The total input of PAHs, OCPs, and PCBs
(sorbed + dissolved) during two flash flood events was estimated at
0.98, 1.32, and 0.34 kg, respectively, the main input corresponding to
p, p'-DDE (1.00 kg). The distribution of organic contaminants in surface
sediments was not homogeneous as a consequence of the presence of many
simultaneous sources and different meteorological, hydrodynamic, and
physicochemical conditions. As a consequence of flash flood events, p,
p'-DDE concentrations in surface sediments increased significantly in
the central and south zones of the lagoon. However, in the case of PCBs,
a dilution effect was observed in the south zone after such events,
reducing the environmental risk. These changes in the pollutant
distribution persisted at least 1 year later (autumn 2010), showing that
the impact of flood events in the distribution of persistent organic
contaminants in Mediterranean coastal lagoons is of relevance according
to the ecological risk assessment carried out. The impact of these
events should be also considered in other coastal systems, especially in
semiarid and semiconfined areas.

wood (LW) is transported, pose several challenges. The process chain
consisting of flood propagation, LW recruitment, entrainment, transport,
and entrapment triggers, at critical sections such as bridges,
unexpected and exacerbated impacts to the exposed built environment. We
provide a review on the recent advances in modelling LW dynamics during
extreme river floods through computational approaches. Moreover, we
describe how scaled flume experiments can enhance process understanding
at critical flow sections such as bridges to address risk mitigation
problems. Additionally, we present a framework based on Formative
Scenario Analysis (FSA) to allow for expert knowledge integration and to
subsequently derive consistent hazard process scenarios in steep
mountain streams where the application of computational approaches is
less reliable. Finally, we discuss how the application of the presented
set of assessment methods can support integral flood risk management by
explicitly considering LW dynamics since the effectiveness of mitigation
critically depends on the acquired process understanding.

PD  - 
AB  - The spatial and seasonal distributions of current-use pesticides (CUPs),
including triazines, organophosphorus pesticides, and tributylphosphate,
were characterized in surface sediments from the Mar Menor lagoon during
2009 and 2010. The impact of two flash flood events on the input of CUPs
and their distribution in the lagoon were also assessed. The total
(dissolved + sorbed phase) input of CUPs in the two flash floods through
the El Albujon watercourse into the lagoon was estimated at 38.9 kg, of
which 9.9 kg corresponded to organophosphorus pesticides and 5.5 kg to
triazines. CUP distribution onto sediments was not homogeneous in the
lagoon due to the different contaminant sources, sediment types, and the
physicochemical and hydrodynamic conditions of the Mar Menor lagoon.
Thirteen CUPs were detected in 2009 and 19 in 2010, including mainly
herbicides, insecticides, and the additive tributylphosphate. Mean CUP
concentrations in the lagoon were generally below 20 ng g(-1), except
for chlorpyrifos and tributylphosphate in 2010. The highest
concentrations were detected in depositional areas of the lagoon, in the
area of influence of the El Albujon watercourse and other wadis with
groundwater contributions such as El Mirador (north) and Los Alcazares
(east) and that of marine water from El Estacio channel. In fact, the
maximum concentration was detected close to El Albujon watercourse
(chlorpyrifos, 102.8 ng g(-1) dry weight). Four herbicides, two
insecticides, two fungicides, and tributylphosphate showed a risk
quotient higher than 1, with that for chlorpyrifos ranging from 96 to
35,200 after flash flood events.

AB  - The Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH hereafter) region is characterized by
mountainous environments and a variety of regional climatic conditions.
High-altitude regions in the HKH have the recent warming amplifications,
especially during the global warming hiatus period. The rapid warming
cause solid state water (snow, ice, glacier, and permafrost) to shrink,
leading to increase in meltwater and there have been found more frequent
incidences of flash floods, landslides, livestock diseases, and other
disasters in the HKH region. Increasing awareness of climate change over
the HKH region is reached a consensus. Meanwhile, the HKH region is
often referred to as the water towers of Asia as many high-altitude
regions store its water in the form of snow and/or glacier, feeding ten
major large rivers in Asia. Therefore, the impacts of climate change on
water availability in these river basins have huge influences on the
livelihood of large number of population, especially in downstream
regions. However, the scarcity of basic hydro-meteorological
observations particularly in high-altitude regions of HKH limits
rigorous analysis of climate change. Most studies used reanalysis data
and/or model-reconstructed products to explore the spatial and temporal
characteristics of hydro-meteorological processes, especially for
extreme events. In this study, we review recent climate change in the
HKH region, and the scientific challenges and research recommendations
are suggested for this high-altitude area.

AB  - Mayotte is a French Overseas Territory of the Comoros archipelago. Since
the 1980. Mayotte has developed quickly: its population has multiplied
by four in less than 30 years, infrastructure expanded rapidly in
lowlands and slums developed in steep areas (through deforestation) or
close to riverbeds. This development urgently required steps to ensure
the safety of urban areas.
From 2002 to 2006, a major programme of natural hazards evaluation and
zonation was conducted by the French Geological Survey in the 17
districts of Mayotte. The programme resulted in the publication of the
first single-hazard zonation maps for Mayotte, at 1:25 000-scale in
rural areas and at 1:10 000-scale in urban areas. Hazard maps regarding
landslides and rock falls, stream floods, seismic lithological and
topographical amplification potential, liquefaction potential and
cyclonic marine submersion were produced for mayors and land planners.
These atlases also included prevention guidelines to minimize risks
associated with land-use or urbanization within hazard-prone areas.
This article presents the main achievements of the programme whose main
problems were the absence of archives, of previous studies and the
original volcanic geology of the island of Mayotte. The atlases
highlight areas with numerous landslides, zones susceptible to flash
floods, sectors likely to be submerged by storm surges and areas subject
to seismic site effects due to thick volcanic weathered formations. This
programme emphasizes the fundamental role in such tropical volcanic
islands, of a good knowledge of the weathered formations, for the
assessment of most natural hazards.
This initial hazard mapping represented the first step to achieve
specific regulatory Risk Prevention Plans for an efficient land use risk
mitigation and reduction policy in Mayotte. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB  - The main objective of this work is to identify and evaluate the
potential impacts produced by climate and land-use changes in six
European test-bed basins (Llobregat, Guadalhorce, Gardon d'Anduze,
Linth, Verzasca and Sambuco). Data to build future scenarios that can
modify the different basins' flash flood and debris flow risk level has
been analyzed in this paper. High resolution climate scenarios have been
obtained from several European projects and/or National initiatives,
depending on each case. Climatic variables have been widely analyzed,
with a special focus on extreme precipitation. Typical generalized
extreme value (GEV) distributions have been fitted to observed and
projected rainfall data to assess impacts in the frequency distributions
of extreme rainfall up to 2100. Regarding climate, the main conclusion
is the importance of using data at the maximum spatial and temporal
resolution applying downscaling methodologies adapted to basin scale
(test-bed areas ranging from approx 200 to 5000 km(2)) and oriented to
obtain extreme rainfall values.
In general, high variability has been detected, obtaining very different
results for the different models and scenarios. Data corrections may
lead to better representations of present situations and, therefore,
more reliable future projections, but currently some of them are not
suitable for extreme precipitation assessment.
Regarding land-use changes, a cellular automata-based model has been
used (MOLAND) to simulate the 2000-2040 period taking the CORINE
land-use dataset as input data. Llobregat, Guadalhorce and Gardon
d'Anduze basins have been identified as potentially interesting for
simulating urban land-use dynamics due to the existence of important
urban areas within their limits. The assessment of the rural land-use
changes has been carried out using the results from the EURURALIS
project (2000-2030 period), available for all the basins.
The results of this paper are framed in the FP7 project IMPRINTS that
has the aim of analyzing impacts of future changes to provide guidelines
for mitigation and adaptation measures and, in general, to improve the
application of the EC Flood Risk Management Directive. (C) 2011 Elsevier

PD  - 
AB  - In ephemeral streams, floods can temporarily connect isolated pools and
provide otherwise spatially restricted organisms with the option to stay
in or leave a pool. A field survey of the middle-eastern fire salamander
(Salamandra infraimmaculata) larvae demonstrated that 18% disappeared
from pools during high-discharge events, and similar to 2% were found
subsequently in downstream pools. We conducted indoor experiments to
test whether larvae alter drift rate in response to different velocities
and perceived risk of predation. We manipulated flow velocities within
the range of natural ephemeral streams during floods. Anesthetized
larvae (passive drifters) drifted out of a central pool faster than
conscious larvae at low velocities but not at high velocities,
suggesting that conscious larvae actively resisted hydraulic pressures.
Drift of small larvae out of a pool in the presence of a caged, larger
cannibalistic conspecific was faster than in the absence of a predator,
indicating that the larvae perceived and attempted to avoid the
predator. Our findings confirm that larval drift that occurs from
normally isolated temporary pools in ephemeral streams, is in part
behaviorally controlled, and can be mediated by predation risk. We
suggest that larval drift can serve as a dispersal pathway for
amphibians and may be of particular importance at local spatial scales
when the terrestrial habitat surrounding breeding sites is fragmented
and movement of terrestrial stages is restricted.

analyzed. These are the front and rear edge elevation, accumulation area
and horizontal sliding distance. Then, the volume and the spatial
distribution of the thickness of the deposit were calculated from the
difference between the DEM available before the landslide, and the
UAV-derived DEM collected after the landslide. Also, the disaster was
assessed using high-resolution satellite images acquired before the
landslide. These include QuickBird, Pleiades-1 and GF-2 images with
spatial resolutions of 0.65 m, 0.70 m, and 0.80 m, respectively, and the
aerial images acquired from the UAV after the landslide with a spatial
resolution of 0.1 m. According to the analysis, the area of the
landslide was 1.62 km(2), and the volume of the landslide was 7.70 +/-
1.46 million m(3). The average thickness of the landslide accumulation
was approximately 8 m. The landslide destroyed a total of 103 buildings.
The area of destroyed farmlands was 2.53 ha, and the orchard area was
reduced by 28.67 ha. A 2-km section of Songpinggou River was blocked and
a 2.1-km section of township road No. 104 was buried. Constrained by the
terrain conditions, densely populated and more economically developed
areas in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River basin are mainly
located in the bottom of the valleys. This is a dangerous area regarding
landslide, debris flow and flash flood events. Therefore, in
mountainous, high-risk disaster areas, it is important to carefully
select residential sites to avoid a large number of casualties.

AB  - Interest in semiarid climate forecasting has prominently grown due to
risks associated with above average levels of precipitation amount.
Longer-lead forecasts in semiarid watersheds are difficult to make due
to short-term extremes and data scarcity. The current research is a new
application of classification and regression trees (CART) model, which
is rule-based algorithm, for prediction of the precipitation over a
highly complex semiarid climate system using climate signals. We also
aimed to compare the accuracy of the CART model with two most commonly
applied models including time series modeling (ARIMA), and adaptive
neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for prediction of the
precipitation. Various combinations of large-scale climate signals were
considered as inputs. The results indicated that the CART model had a
better results (with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE > 0.75) compared to
the ANFIS and ARIMA in forecasting precipitation. Also, the results
demonstrated that the ANFIS method can predict the precipitation values
more accurately than the time series model based on various performance
criteria. Further, fall forecasts ranked ``very good{''} for the CART
method, while the ANFIS and the time series model approximately
indicated ``satisfactory{''} and ``unsatisfactory{''} performances for
all stations, respectively. The forecasts from the CART approach can be
helpful and critical for decision makers when precipitation forecast
heralds a prolonged drought or flash flood.

AB  - In 1996, an abandoned uranium mine was re-discovered in the Djilubulak
ephemeral stream valley on the southern shore of Issyk- Kul - one of the
largest and most pristine lakes in the world. The tail storages from the
past mining may pose a pollution hazard to the lake water and sediments.
A chain of six protective pools interconnected by drain pipes descend
from the abandoned mine and processing plant down the Djilubulak stream
valley. To assess the effectiveness of these catch pools and the scale
of pollution risk the investigation of tail storages composition was
performed. As a result, three sources of anomalous radioactivity were
discovered:
1. Natural brown coal with the mean total radioactivity value not
exceeding 16 kBq kg(-1), with U being in state of equilibrium with Ra.
2. Ashes depleted in U (relative to Ra) with the mean radioactivity
reaching 49 kBq kg(-1), mostly due to the Ra content.
3. Clay and silt from the artificial protective pools where U activity
(up to 2 - 2.5 kBq kg(-1)) significantly exceeds that of Ra indicating
recent process of U enrichment. Uranium in these pools is accompanied by
very high contents of heavy metals such as Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, Cr, and to a
smaller degree Pb, Mo, Hg, Ag.
From the upper catch pool to the lower ones the content of U and some
heavy metals diminishes. Within the two lowest pools neither U nor heavy
metal contents exceed background values ( U < 0.1 kBq kg(-1)). It
appears that the system of catch pools effectively protects Lake Issyk-
Kul from inorganic pollutants at the present time. However, a flash
flood or other catastrophic event could breach the catch pool dams and
carry radioactive elements and heavy metals into the Djilubulak stream
valley and the lake.

AB  - Field experiments were done in two sites, Yixing and Changshu, Jiangsu
province, China, to study P movement and leaching in flooded paddy
soils. P movement in soil was investigated by using the KH2 (PO4)-P-32
tracker method, and the amount of P leached from the soil layer in
different depths was estimated by measuring P concentrations in the soil
solution and saturated hydraulic conductivities in field. Determination
was done about one month after P application. There was 46% and 42% of
total P-32 retained in the 0 - 5cm layer of soil in the Yixing site and
in the Changshu site respectively. The P-32 retained in the 25 - 30 cm
layer was only about 1 - 2% of the total P-32 added. Furthermore,
8.01% of P-32 in the soil of Yixing site and 16.8% of P-32 in the soil
of Changshu site was lost from the layer 0 - 30 cm soil. The seasonal
amounts of P leached from the top soil layer and from bottom layer are
about 4.5 - 5.8% and 1.6 - 2.1% of the total P application,
respectively. Changes of total P concentrations in soil solutions during
rice growth showed that the fertilizer P applied before flooding of the
paddy fields suffered a flash leaching loss and a slow leaching loss. We
concluded that the fertilizer P could quickly move in the flooded paddy
rice field and parts of it can enter into surface water and ground
water. Unless the P application is well managed the risk of P loss and
consequently environmental pollution exist.

PD  - 
AB  - A mediterranean-type climate exists in five widely separated regions;
the Mediterranean basin, parts of western North America, parts of
western and southern Australia, southwestern South Africa and parts of
central Chile. Streams in these regions feature seasonal disturbances of
contrasting hydrology with high predictability of the timing of flooding
and drying but low constancy. We would expect fish living in these
streams to avoid scouring flow and breed after cessation of the flood
period. The aim of the present study was to examine the adaptation of
the Yarqon bleak, Acanthobrama telavivensis, an endemic cyprinid in the
coastal streams of Israel, to mediterranean-type stream
(mediterranean-written with a small m, is used in connection with
climate or ecological region and is distinguished from Mediterranean
that is used in a geographical context, referring to the Mediterranean
basin.) conditions. For that we studied its reproductive strategy (age
at maturity and life span, gonad activity, oocyte maturation, spawning
activity and habitats, appearance of juveniles), in a major costal
stream (Yarqon). Our findings show that the Yarqon bleak exhibits life
history traits attuned with a mediterranean-climate hydrologic regime.
It breeds in late winter and early spring, a window of opportunity
between flash floods and habitat desiccation. Being a multiple spawner
allows the fish to compensate for the potential loss of part of its
reproductive output due to scouring flows of late floods. The ability of
the Yarqon bleak to spawn on different substrate-types enables it to
take advantage of different stream conditions that pertain in different
years. The fish attains pre-adult size (ca. 33-42 mm) within the first
year, prior to drying out of most stream reaches, and matures by the
beginning of the second year (males > 41; females > 42 mm). The cost of
these tactics is a short life span (4-5 age groups). The reproductive
strategy of the Yarqon bleak falls into the category of in-channel
breeding but, unlike the case suggested by a low flow recruitment model,
the fish breed during the period of flood cessation, a transitional time
between high and low flows, rather than at the time of low flow.
Breeding at this time of the year in mediterranean-type streams puts
early stages somewhat at risk of being washed away by late floods, but
gains them a longer period of growth under favorable conditions. We
suggest an additional positive tradeoff that should be investigated: the
reduced competition with age 0 of other fish that breed later in the
season. This suggested model of recruitment during the period of flood
cessation seems appropriate for fish in streams with seasonal
contrasting flows of high predictability but low constancy.

AB  - The directive 2008/105/EC suggests the use of sediment or biota matrix
for long-term monitoring of specific priority pollutants that tend to
accumulate. But, the intermittent nature of flow in the majority of the
Mediterranean rivers results in large variability of biological
communities and especially fish, making advantageous the examination of
pollution trend in sediment matrix and not in living organisms (biota).
In this study, sediment environmental quality standards (EQSs) and
sediment quality indicators (SQIs) were used to assess pollution by
heavy metals (cadmium, nickel, lead, mercury, arsenic, chromium, copper,
and zinc) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Evrotas River,
South Greece, monitored seasonally for 2 years (2009-2010) in five
sampling sites. The results showed that, based on SQIs (geoaccumulation
index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), and modified degree of
contamination (mCd)), sediments of the Evrotas River can be classified
as ``low polluted,{''} with some exceptions of ``extreme pollution.{''}
EQS assessment revealed heavy metal pollution ranging from ``low{''} to
``medium high.{''} Furthermore, based on the Hakanson's ecological risk
index (RI) method, heavy metal potential risk was classified from
``low{''} to ``extreme.{''} Cadmium showed the highest RI values, while
mercury reached ``moderate{''} pollution level. The average SPAH
concentration (24.4 ng g(-1)) was lower than both the reported EQSs and
the values found in literature for unpolluted or moderately polluted
river sediments. Increased heavy metal and PAH concentrations were found
in sites where mixing of freshwater with reclaimed water occurred. EQSs
are suggested to be supplemented with the RI or EF index that consider
the natural background to assist a first ecorisk assessment and should
be foreseen by 2008/105/EC directive. Sediments can be considered as a
valuable matrix in assessing the spatial and temporal trends of several
contaminants and should be included in the monitoring program of
temporary river management plans. Special attention should be given when
defining reference sites and the sampling period. Decreasing flow period
at the beginning of the spring prevailed in order to diminish any
disturbance by flash flood events.

T1  - Morphological impacts of flow events of varying magnitude on ephemeral channels in a semiarid region
A1  - Hooke, J M
Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Flows in ephemeral channels in semiarid areas are only occasional, and
channel changes are episodic; but the flash floods can be devastating
and have major geomorphological impacts. Data on morphological impacts
of flows in semiarid areas are needed to increase understanding of the
dynamics and variability of geomorphic responses in such channels. For
this purpose nine reaches of river channel in three catchments in SE
Spain - the Nogalte, Torrealvilla, and Salada - have been sites for
measurement of flows and their effects over the period 1997-2012. The
sites encompass a range of channel size, channel morphology, substrate,
vegetation, and position within the catchments. A major difference is
between schist and marl bedrock areas. Peak flow stage has been recorded
and topography surveyed at frequent intervals and after major flow
events. Over the 16-year period, an average of 0.5 flow events per year
has been recorded at the schist sites, and an average of one per year at
the marl sites; but occurrence has been highly variable from year to
year. Threshold daily rainfall for channel flow is mostly 15-20 mm, but
higher rainfalls do not always produce flow. One to two major floods
have occurred in each of the catchments in the period, including the
extreme flood event of September 2012 in the Nogalte catchment. Measured
morphological changes have occurred between 2 and 10 times at the
monitored sites. The same size flow can have differing effects depending
on the state of the system. Low flow can mobilise sediment without
producing much morphological change. The long-term trajectory of the
reaches and the sediment substrate has a major influence on response to
events. Channel change is governed by threshold values of hydraulic
conditions. The measurements provide an indication of the scale of
maximum erosion and deposition that occurs within the channels and on
the floodplains over a range of flow magnitudes and the flow impacts
that need to be considered in management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

PD  - 
AB  - Rivei managers are aware that wood-clogging mechanisms frequently
trigger damage-causing processes like structural damages at bridges,
sudden channel outbursts, and occasionally, major displacements of the
water course. To successfully mitigate flood risks related to the
transport of large wood (LW), river managers need a guideline for an
accurate and reliable risk assessment procedure and the design of river
sections and bridges that are endangered of LW clogging.
In recent years, comprehensive research dealing with the triggers of
wood-clogging mechanisms at bridges and the corresponding impacts on
flood risk was accomplished at the University of Innsbruck. A large set
of laboratory experiments in a rectangular flume was conducted. In this
paper we provide an overall view of these tests and present our
findings. By applying a logistic regression analysis, the available
knowledge on the influence of geometrical, hydraulic, and wood-related
parameters on LW clogging probabilities is processed in a generalized
form. Based on the experimental modeling results a practice-oriented
guideline that supports the assessment of flood risk induced by LW
clogging, is presented. In this context, two specific local structural
protection measures at the bridge, aiming for a significant decrease of
the entrapment probabilities, are illustrated: (i) a deflecting baffle
installed on the upstream face of the bridge and (ii) a channel
constriction leading to a change in flow state and a corresponding
increase of the flow velocities and the freeboard at the bridge cross
section. The presented guideline is based on a three-step approach:
estimation of LW potential, entrainment, and transport; clogging
scenario at the bridge; and the impact on channel and floodplain
hydraulics. For a specific bridge susceptible to potential clogging
caused by LW entrapment, it allows for a qualitative evaluation of
potential LW entrainment in the upstream river segments, its transport
toward the hydraulic bottleneck, and for a quantification of expected
entrapment probabilities. Depending on the amount and characteristics of
the impacting LW, consequences of bridge clogging can be determined and
LW bridge-clogging scenarios can be considered within hydrodynamic
numerical modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

commissioned a study into measures taken by local municipalities to plan
for climate change. Two areas were selected for their dissimilar
climatic challenges: the //Khara Hais Municipality,(1) a semi-desert
area in the Northern Cape Province plagued by droughts and severe
weather events, and the George Municipality, an area in the Western Cape
Province plagued by droughts, the rising sea level and flash floods. It
was found that despite South African laws and regulations requiring
local government to take action to reduce the risk of disasters,
planning for climate change is still no more than sophisticated rhetoric
in the two municipalities. This lack of urgency can be ascribed to local
municipalities having other more pressing developmental priorities. It
would, however, be short-sighted of municipalities not to plan for
climate change, as major setbacks in hard-won economic and social
development follow a disaster.

AB  - Arsenic (As) is an odorless semi-metal that occurs naturally in rock and
soil, and As contamination in groundwater resources has become a serious
threat to human health. Thus, assessing the spatial and temporal
variability of As concentration is highly desirable, particularly in
heavily As-contaminated areas. However, various difficulties may be
encountered in the regional estimation of As concentration such as
cost-intensive field monitoring, scarcity of field data, identification
of important factors affecting As, over-fitting or poor estimation
accuracy. This study develops a novel systematical dynamic-neural
modeling (SDM) for effectively estimating regional As-contaminated water
quality by using easily-measured water quality variables. To tackle the
difficulties commonly encountered in regional estimation, the SDM
comprises of a neural network and four statistical techniques: the
Nonlinear Autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) network, Gamma
test, cross-validation, Bayesian regularization method and indicator
kriging (IK). For practical application, this study investigated a
heavily As-contaminated area in Taiwan. The backpropagation neural
network (BPNN) is adopted for comparison purpose. The results
demonstrate that the NARX network (Root mean square error (RMSE): 95.11
mu g l(-1) for training; 106.13 mu g l(-1) for validation) outperforms
the BPNN (RMSE: 121.54 mu g l(-1) for training; 143.37 mu g l(-1) for
validation). The constructed SDM can provide reliable estimation (R-2 >
0.89) of As concentration at ungauged sites based merely on three
easily-measured water quality variables (Alk, Ca2+ and pH). In addition,
risk maps under the threshold of the WHO drinking water standard (10 mu
g l(-1)) are derived by the IK to visually display the spatial and
temporal variation of the As concentration in the whole study area at
different time spans. The proposed SDM can be practically applied with
satisfaction to the regional estimation in study areas of interest and
the estimation of missing, hazardous or costly data to facilitate water
resources management. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

human health in the Himalayan region by applying ecosystem approaches to
human health (or EcoHealth). Land-use transition in the Himalayan and
similar regions includes sedentarization, agricultural intensification,
habitat modification, migration, change of livelihoods and lifestyles,
biodiversity loss, and increasing flash floods. These transitions, which
can have impacts on human health, are driven by state policies, a market
economy, and climate change. Human health is dependent on access to
ecosystem services for food, nutrition, medicine, fiber and shelter,
fresh water, and clear air. Ecosystem management has been a key means of
controlling disease vectors and creating suitable habitats for human
well-being. The paper identifies the web of environmental factors that
influence human health. Institutional and policy issues for land-use and
health transitions are also discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB  - Although spate irrigation systems are risk-prone, they can be an
important component for livelihood security in semi-arid areas. Spate
uses water (flood water), which upstream users often do not require, as
rainfall during these periods is more than sufficient. The use of this
flood water for spate irrigation is therefore a good opportunity to
convert water with a low opportunity cost to high value water. As more
rivers are closing, due to socio-economic and climate changes, spate
irrigation may become increasingly relevant in semi-arid areas. Spate
irrigation systems pose institutional and technical challenges:
collective action is challenged by complex upstream-downstream
interactions between users within the system, and the high labour
demands for regular reconstruction of temporary diversion weirs and
intake structures. This paper describes a spate irrigation system in
Makanya village, Tanzania that emerged in response to increased upstream
water use. We use three of the four dimensions (hydrological, hydraulic
and sociological) of spate irrigation proposed by Van Steenbergen (1997)
to assess the Makanya spate irrigation system. The Makanya spate
irrigation system has an organisational structure that is similar to the
canal irrigation (furrow) committees located upstream, and effectively
deals with the institutional demands of managing water in spate
irrigation systems. Water allocation is reminiscent to the water sharing
arrangements existing in the full irrigation system, which previously
was in place at the site and in the high- and midlands of the Makanya
catchment and therefore set this system apart from the traditional spate
irrigation practice elsewhere. Technically, a major challenge is the
reconstruction of the head works after each flood. Another aspect is the
changes in the river bed. Flash floods carry sediments that deposit on
the fields, raising the elevation of the irrigated land every year and
making it increasingly difficult for the river water to enter the plots.
Improving system efficiency through modernisation of the diversion and
distribution structures in this case is not feasible due to the huge
amounts of sediments delivered to the system each year. Instead
investments in conjunctive use of groundwater could be the solution
because it involves a relatively small intervention, minimises the
physical disturbance of the system, and therefore is likely to respect
the existing locally developed water management arrangements. (C) 2010

AB  - The Llobregat is a Mediterranean river that is severely impacted by
anthropogenic pressures. It is characterized by high flow variability
which modulates its chemical and biological status. The present work
evaluates the effects of flow changes on the concentration of
pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) and their relationship to
cellular parameters of river biofilms. To this end, at two selected
sampling sites at the lower course of the Llobregat river, surface water
samples were collected twice a week over two hydrologically different
periods exhibiting low and high river flows. Higher levels of PhACs were
detected at the downstream sampling site. Irrespective of the flow
regime, analgesics, anti-inflammatories and lipid regulators were the
most abundant substances at both sampling sites with total
concentrations of up to1000 ng/L and 550 ng/L at the upstream and
downstream sites, respectively. Antibiotics (fluoroquinolones) and
psychiatric treatment drugs were also detected at high levels in the
second campaign achieving concentrations of up to 500 ng/L. The
principal component analysis (PCA) performed with the PhACs
concentrations of the two campaigns revealed differences in the various
therapeutic groups depending on sampling site and period. After a flash
flood event during the second sampling period, dilution of PhACs
occurred, but their average concentrations measured before the flood
were restored within two weeks. For the majority of compounds, PhAC
concentrations displayed an inverse relationship with river discharge
The effects of water containing different concentrations of PhACs on
biofilm communities were evaluated and related to flow regime
variations. Translocation of biofilm communities from a less to a more
polluted site of the river demonstrated an increase in bacteria
mortality in the translocated biofilms. After the flood, extracellular
peptidase activity and chlorophyll-a concentration were significantly
reduced, and biofilm growth rate was significantly lower. (C) 2013

AB  - In Kenya, sub-surface groundwater dams are constructed at a rapid pace
to store water for livestock, irrigation and domestic use. The basic
principle of such dams is that water is stored sub-surface instead of at
the surface. Evaporation losses and contamination risks are thus greatly
reduced. The sub-surface reservoirs are recharged through flash floods
originating from rainfall events. A simple groundwater-flow model was
developed to understand hydrological processes and flows around the dam.
Two different situations in Kenya were studied with the model. The first
case in Voi shows how the groundwater levels upstream of the dam and in
the adjacent riverbanks are strongly influenced when the sub-surface
water is used for relatively intensive irrigation. The second case in
Kitui shows the relatively mild effects of household water use on
groundwater levels. The model results appear to be realistic. Therefore
the model can be used to evaluate the hydrological processes of sand
storage dam reservoirs in situations where measured data are scarce. (c)

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Plants require water for growth and development, but excessive water
negatively affects their productivity and viability. Flash floods
occasionally result in complete submergence of plants in agricultural
and natural ecosystems. When immersed in water, plants encounter
multiple stresses including low oxygen, low light, nutrient deficiency,
and high risk of infection. As floodwaters subside, submerged plants are
abruptly exposed to higher oxygen concentration and greater light
intensity, which can induce post-submergence injury caused by oxidative
stress, high light, and dehydration. Recent studies have emphasized the
significance of multiple stress tolerance in the survival of submergence
and prompt recovery following desubmergence. A mechanistic understanding
of acclimation responses to submergence at molecular and physiological
levels can contribute to the deciphering of the regulatory networks
governing tolerance to other environmental stresses that occur
simultaneously or sequentially in the natural progress of a flood event.

PD  - 
AB  - Climate changing is a global threat to the world. There are so many
reasons behind this problem. One of the major reasons is carbon
emissions in atmosphere. The causes for this global threat are many,
among them GHG (green house gas emission) is one of them. Also
deforestation, land use change, sulfate aerosol and black carbon are the
other major reason leading to the ozone layer depletion and changing
climate. Due to the carbon emission atmosphere is being polluted and
also so many disasters happen routinely. Atmosphere is getting hot day
by day. Due to this unnatural and sudden temperature rise, glaciers are
melting, so sudden flash floods occur. Agricultural sector is also
suffering due to the global warming effects. This will also affect the
productivity of grains world wide. Climate changing increases land and
as well as sea temperature and alters precipitation quantity and
patterns. As a result increasing the global average sea level, risk of
coastal erosions, etc. climate change will be an added stress for the
fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Effects will also be severe on coasts
and marine ecosystems. Extreme events like drought, flood may also
happen due to these impacts. This paper elaborately present the current
situation of climate changing and the causes of its vulnerable effects,
also the mitigation action of climate changing are also discussed. (C)

AB  - Advances in e-Infrastructure promise to revolutionize sensing systems
and the way in which data are collected and assimilated, and complex
water systems are simulated and visualized. According to the EU
Infrastructure 2010 work-programme, data and compute infrastructures and
their underlying technologies, either oriented to tackle scientific
challenges or complex problem solving in engineering, are expected to
converge together into the so-called knowledge infrastructures, leading
to a more effective research, education and innovation in the next
decade and beyond. Grid technology is recognized as a fundamental
component of e-Infrastructures. Nevertheless, this emerging paradigm
highlights several topics, including data management, algorithm
optimization, security, performance (speed, throughput, bandwidth,
etc.), and scientific cooperation and collaboration issues that require
further examination to fully exploit it and to better inform future
research policies. The paper illustrates the results of six different
surface and subsurface hydrology applications that have been deployed on
the Grid. All the applications aim to answer to strong requirements from
the Civil Society at large, relatively to natural and anthropogenic
risks. Grid technology has been successfully tested to improve flood
prediction, ground-water resources management and Black Sea hydrological
survey, by providing large computing resources. It is also shown that
Grid technology facilitates e-cooperation among partners by means of
services for authentication and authorization, seamless access to
distributed data sources, data protection and access right, and

AB  - The present work addresses the problem of lack of coordination between
policies and actors with joint competence for risk management, i.e.,
civil protection, spatial planning, and sectoral planning (e.g., forest
policy in the case of forest fire risk). Spatial planning in particular
is assigned a minor or no role at all though it might perfectly operate
as the coordinating policy platform; the reason is that spatially
relevant analysis and policy guidance is an omnipresent component of the
risk management cycle. However, disconnected risk relevant policies
turning a blind eye to spatial planning might cause several adverse
repercussions: Breaks in the
response-preparedness-prevention-remediation chain (which should
function as a continuum), minimal attention to prevention, risk
expansion and growth instead of mitigation, lack of synergies between
involved actors as well as duplicated or even diverging measures and
funding. The authors bear witness to the above suggestions by examining
three cases of European (regional and local) risk management systems
faced with failures when confronting natural hazards (floods and forest
fires). These three systems are embedded in different types of
political-administrative structures, namely those of the city of
Dortmund (Germany) facing floods, Eastern Attica region (Greece), and
Lazio Region (Italy) facing forest fires.

AB  - Climate changes in the Mediterranean region, related to a significant
increase in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns, can
potentially affect local economies. Agriculture and tourism are
undoubtedly the most important economic sources for Greece and these may
be more strongly affected by changing future climate conditions. Climate
change and their various negative impacts on human life are also
detected in their environment; hence this study deals with implications,
caused by changing climate, in urban and forest areas. Potential changes
for the mid-twenty-first century (2021-2050) are analysed using a
high-resolution regional climate model. This paper presents relevant
climatic indices, indicative for potential implications which may
jeopardise vital economic/environmental sectors of the country. The
results provide insights into particular regions of the Greek territory
that may undergo substantial impacts due to climate change. It is
concluded that the duration of dry days is expected to increase in most
of the studied agricultural regions. Winter precipitation generally
decreases, whereas an increase in autumn precipitation is projected in
most areas. Changing climate conditions associated with increased
minimum temperatures (approximately 1.3A degrees C) and decreased winter
precipitation by 15% on average suggest that the risk for forest fires
is intensified in the future. In urban areas, unpleasantly high
temperatures during day and night will increase the feeling of
discomfort in the citizens, while flash floods events are expected to
occur more frequently. Another impact of climate change in urban regions
is the increasing energy demand for cooling in summer. Finally, it was
found that continental tourist areas of the Greek mainland will more
often face heatwave episodes. In coastal regions, increased temperatures
especially at night in combination with high levels of relative humidity
can lead to conditions that are nothing less than uncomfortable for
foreigners and the local population. In general, projected changes
associated with temperature have a higher degree of confidence than
those associated with precipitation.

Y1  - 2008///
PD  - 
AB  - Natural disturbance regimes-cycles of fire, flood, drought or other
events-range from highly predictable (disturbances occur regularly in
time or in concert with a proximate cue) to highly unpredictable. While
theory predicts how populations should evolve under different degrees of
disturbance predictability, there is little empirical evidence of how
this occurs in nature. Here, we demonstrate local adaptation in
populations of an aquatic insect occupying sites along a natural
gradient of disturbance predictability, where predictability was defined
as the ability of a proximate cue (rainfall) to signal a disturbance
(flash flood). In controlled behavioural experiments, populations from
predictable environments responded to rainfall events by quickly exiting
the water and moving sufficiently far from the stream to escape flash
floods. By contrast, populations from less predictable environments had
longer response times and lower response rates, reflecting the
uncertainty inherent to these environments. Analysis with signal
detection theory showed that for 13 out of 15 populations, observed
response times were an optimal compromise between the competing risks of
abandoning versus remaining in the stream, mediated by the
rainfall-flood correlation of the local environment. Our study provides
the first demonstration that populations can evolve in response to
differences in disturbance predictability, and provides evidence that
populations can adapt to among-stream differences in flow regime.

AB  - Global simulations have been conducted with the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts operational model run at T1279 resolution
for multiple decades representing climate from the late twentieth and
late twenty-first centuries. Changes in key components of the water
cycle are examined, focusing on variations at short time scales. Metrics
of coupling and feedbacks between soil moisture and surface fluxes and
between surface fluxes and properties of the planetary boundary layer
(PBL) are inspected. Features of precipitation and other water cycle
trends from coupled climate model consensus projections are well
simulated. Extreme 6-hourly rainfall totals become more intense over
much of the globe, suggesting an increased risk for flash floods.
Seasonal-scale droughts are projected to escalate over much of the
subtropics and midlatitudes during summer, while tropical and winter
droughts become less likely. These changes are accompanied by an
increase in the responsiveness of surface evapotranspiration to soil
moisture variations. Even though daytime PBL depths increase over most
locations in the next century, greater latent heat fluxes also occur
over most land areas, contributing a larger energy effect per unit mass
of air, except over some semiarid regions. This general increase in land
atmosphere coupling is represented in a combined metric as a ``land
coupling index{''} that incorporates the terrestrial and atmospheric
effects together. The enhanced feedbacks are consistent with the
precipitation changes, but a causal connection cannot be made without
further sensitivity studies. Nevertheless, this approach could be
applied to the output of traditional climate change simulations to
assess changes in land atmosphere feedbacks.

PD  - 
AB  - The Tet River is a typical Mediterranean river in the South of France
where brief and violent flash-floods frequently occur. This paper
presents a detailed portrait of the average hydroclimatic patterns in
this river basin and investigates their evolution from 1980 to 2000.
Average temperatures during this period have been the warmest of the
last century, and we intended to find out whether this temperature
increase was accompanied by a greater risk of floods, according to the
general believe that greater temperatures should lead to an
intensification of the water cycle. Average spring temperatures in the
basin follow indeed a highly significant trend towards increasing
temperatures. Average autumn temperature, however, decreased and
counterbalanced partly the spring increase. Mean annual runoff was
highly variable and shows no clear trend over the investigated period.
But for flood discharge, an evolution towards increasing values can be
detected, although only in the downstream part of the basin. Also mean
annual precipitation over the entire basin shows no clear evolution, but
the contribution from the highest basin parts decreased whereas the
contribution from the middle and lower basin parts increased. Our
findings suggest that humidity of Mediterranean origin became more
important for the hydroclimatic functioning of the Tet basin. If these
trends persist in the future, flood frequency of the river may increase.

AB  - Millions of dollars are spent each year in the United States to mitigate
the effects of wildfires and reduce the risk of flash floods and debris
flows. Research from forested, chaparral, and rangeland communities
indicate that severe wildfires can cause significant increases in soil
water repellency resulting in increased runoff and erosion. Few data are
available to document the effects of fire on the spatial and temporal
variability in soil water repellency and potential impacts on
infiltration and runoff on sagebrush-dominated landscapes. Soil water
repellency, infiltration and runoff were assessed after two wildfires
and one prescribed fire in three steep, sagebrush-dominated watersheds
with coarse-textured soils. Water repellency was generally greater on
unburned hillslopes and annual variability in water repellency had a
greater impact on infiltration capacity than fire effects. The most
significant impact of fire was canopy and ground cover removal on
coppice microsites. Infiltration rates decreased on coppice microsites
after fire even though soil water repellency was reduced. Fire-induced
reduction in infiltration resulted from the combined effect of canopy
and ground cover removal and the presence of naturally strong water
repellent soils. Removal of ground cover likely increased the spatial
connectivity of runoff areas from strongly water repellent soils. The
results indicate that for coarse-textured sagebrush landscapes with high
pre-fire soil water repellency, post-fire increases in runoff are more
influenced by fire removal of ground and canopy cover than fire effects
on soil water repellency and that the degree of these impacts may be
significantly influenced by short-term fluctuations in water repellent
soil conditions. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Towards a scientific understanding of the risk from extreme space weather
A1  - Hapgood, M A
Y1  - 2011///
PD  - 
AB  - Like all natural hazards, space weather exhibits occasional extreme
events over timescales of decades to centuries. Historical events
provoked much interest, and sometimes alarm, because bright aurora
becomes visible at mid-latitudes. However, they had little economic
impact because the major technologies of those eras were not sensitive
to space weather. This is no longer true. The widespread adoption of
advanced technological infrastructures over the past 40 years has
created significant sensitivity. So these events now have the potential
to disrupt those infrastructures and thus have profound economic and
societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such events are
rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of the
events. This limitation is uniquely serious for space weather since it
is a global phenomenon. Many other natural hazards (e.g. flash floods)
are highly localised, so statistically significant datasets can be
assembled by combining data from independent instances of the hazard
recorded over a few decades. Such datasets are the foundation on which
reliable risk assessment methodologies are built. But we have a single
instance of space weather so we would have to make observations for many
centuries in order to build a statistically significant dataset. We show
that it is not practicable to assess the risk from extreme events using
simple statistical methods. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of
solar-terrestrial physics to find other ways to assess these risks. We
discuss three alternative approaches: (a) use of proxy data, (b) studies
of other solar systems, and (c) use of physics-based modelling. We note
that the proxy data approach is already well-established as a technique
for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not yet
provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms.
This latter risk is more suited to the other approaches, but significant
research is needed to make progress. We need to develop and expand
techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar
systems (stellar flares, radio emissions from planetary aurorae). And to
make progress in modelling severe space weather, we need to focus on the
physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e.g. how can dayside
and tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to
envelop mid-latitudes? (C) 2010 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

T1  - The environmental state of rivers in the Balkans-A review within the DPSIR framework
A1  - Skoulikidis, Nikolaos Th.
Y1  - 2009///
PD  - 
AB  - Fifteen major Balkan rivers with over 80% of the inflows in Eastern
Mediterranean were examined for their environmental state within the
DPSIR framework. Physicogeographic and hydrochemical conditions differ
substantially among river basins, which may be roughly classified into
three main zones. Despite Strong fragmentation, most of the rivers are
liable to flash floods and have low summer flow. Decreasing
precipitation and (mis)management caused a dramatic discharge reduction
over the last decades. Wars, political instability, economical crises
over the past decades, combined with administrative and structural
constraints, poor environmental planning and inspection and, frequently,
a lack of environmental awareness imposed significant pressures on
rivers. Large wetland areas were drained in favour of widespread
intensive agriculture. The treatment of municipal wastewaters is barely
adequate in Greece and insufficient elsewhere, while management and
treatment of mining and industrial wastewaters is overall poor. In
general, lowland river sections are hydro-morphologically modified and
are at the greatest pollution risk, while upstream areas mostly retain
their natural conditions. Nutrient concentrations in a number of central
and eastern Balkan rivers often exceed quality standards, whereas
pesticides and heavy metals, partly of geochemical origin, occasionally
exceed quality standards. Reservoirs retain vast masses of sediments,
thus adversely affecting delta evolution, while dam operation disturbs
the seasonal hydrological and hydrochemical regimes. Almost all Balkan
countries face daunting water resource challenges because Of urgently
needed investments in water supply, sanitation, irrigation, and
hydroelectricity. International treaties and designations and European
Union Directives have mobilized pollution mitigation and conservation
efforts. However, the application of environmental legislation has
proved in a number of cases inadequate. Constraints arise from
long-standing top-down planning traditions, inadequate planning of
national environmental policies, poor administrative capacities, and
heavy investment requirements, often combined with a lack of
environmental awareness. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PD  - 
AB  - Global warming is expected to make the climate warmer, wetter, and
wilder. It is predicted that such climate change will increase the
severity and frequency of climate-related disasters like flash floods,
surges, cyclones, and severe storms. This article uses econometric
methods to study the consequences of climate-induced natural disasters
on economic growth, and how these disasters are linked to the onset of
armed civil conflict either directly or via their impact on economic
growth. The results show that climate-related natural disasters have a
negative effect on growth and that the impact is considerable. The
analysis of conflict onset shows that climate-related natural disasters
do not increase the risk of armed conflict. This is also true when we
instrument the change in GDP growth by climatic disasters. The result is
robust to inclusion of country and time fixed effects, different
estimation techniques, and various operationalization of the disasters
measure, as well as for conflict incidence and war onset. These findings
have two major implications: if climate change increases the frequency
or makes weather-related natural disasters more severe, it is an
economic concern for countries susceptible to these types of hazards.
However, our results suggest - based on historical data - that more
frequent and severe climate-related disasters will not lead to more
armed conflicts through their effects on GDP growth.

T1  - Flash floods and aquatic insect life-history evolution: Evaluation of multiple models
A1  - Lytle, D A
Y1  - 2002///
PD  - 
AB  - In disturbance ecology there is a tension between ecological and
evolutionary viewpoints, because while disturbances often cause
mortality in populations (an ecological effect), populations may also
evolve mechanisms that ameliorate mortality risk (an evolutionary
effect). Flash floods cause high mortality in the juvenile aquatic stage
of desert stream insects, but these ecological effects may be mitigated
by the evolution of life-history strategies that allow the terrestrial
adult stage to avoid floods. Life-history theory predicts that, to
balance trade-offs between juvenile growth and mortality risk from
floods, (1) most individuals should emerge before the peak of the flood
season, (2) optimal body size at emergence should decline as flood
probability increases, and (3) a second decline in body size at
emergence should occur as the reproductive season ends. These
predictions were tested with data on body mass at and timing of
emergence of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus measured in three montane
Chihuahuan Desert (Arizona, USA) streams over two years. P. aeneus that
had not reached the adult stage were eliminated from site-years that
experienced flash floods, suggesting that timing of emergence is an
important fitness component. On average 86% of emergence occurred
before the long-term (similar to100 yr) mean arrival date of the first
seasonal flood, supporting prediction 1. The presence of two consecutive
declines in body mass at emergence in most site-years was congruent with
predictions 2 and 3. To test whether the two declines were associated
with increasing flood probability and end of the reproductive season,
respectively, maximum-likelihood methods were used to compare five
body-size models: a null model that contains no parameters related to
flood regime or reproductive season, a seasonal model that incorporates
a reproductive time constraint, and three disturbance models that
incorporate both reproductive time constraints and flood dynamics. The
disturbance models outperformed the other models, suggesting that at
least some of the body-mass pattern was influenced by flood dynamics.
The timing of the first flood of the season was the most important
determinant of observed emergence patterns. Overall, this study
demonstrates that aquatic insects can compensate for flash floods by
using state-dependent emergence strategies that are synchronized with
long-term flood dynamics.

AB  - Countering network attacks is becoming ever more challenging. Web-based
vulnerabilities represent a substantial portion of the security
exposures of computer networks. In order to detect a new Web-based
assault named shrew Distributed Denial of Service attacks based on HTTP
flood, Principle Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis
are applied to abstract the multivariate observation vector. A novel
anomaly detector based on hidden semi-Markov model is proposed.
Experiment results based on real traffic trace and emulated attacks
show, the scheme can be used effectively to implement the detection of
the shrew HTTP flood attacks embedded in the normal flash crowd of
large-scale Website; and the detection is not dependent on the intensity
of attack traffic.

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Disasters are on the rise, and we cannot estimate the full range of
impact of natural hazards, climate change and climate variability. Water
scarcity is a major challenge for some part of our country. Increasing
urbanization and pressure on land use will continue to increase our
vulnerability and as a result more and more people will be at risk. We
need to stop environmental degradation, enhance information exchange and
cross border cooperation to ensure disaster risk reduction. However,
there is a need of sustainable and coherent institutional mechanism with
a vision of long term planning. Governments will still be judged by how
they respond to a disaster. Disasters do give us windows of opportunity.
We need to use these windows to ensure that people are not put back into
the same vulnerable position again and again. There is a need to change
the traditional one-dimensional focus on response and to build a
stronger understanding of the need to evolve strong and disaster
resilient societies. The earthquake 2005 was an eye opener for the
government of Pakistan and the whole nation. The establishment of
Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (ERRA), National
Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Provincial Disaster management
Authorities (PDMAs) and FATA Disaster Management Authority (FDMA) reveal
the significance of the disaster management. Beside, this development
the efforts of the private sector institutions and organizations cannot
be ignored. They not only responded to the earthquake, 2005 and flash
floods of Peshawar, 2008 but are also engaged in providing services to
the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and still providing services to
the affected communities of floods 2010 throughout the country. It is
clear that a radical change in the approach towards comprehensive
disaster management is needed, with far greater attention toward
prevention and preparedness rather than relief and rehabilitation.
Perhaps we should begin by tackling the matter at the most fundamental
level in order to ascertain and apportion the moral responsibility for
the safety of the marginal population that inhibits risk zones. The
present chapter is an attempt to explore the institutional structure for
disaster management in Pakistan. The chapter focuses on an overview of
disasters in Pakistan, causes of Pakistan's vulnerability to disasters
and climate change impacts as well as legal framework for disaster
management in Pakistan, Institutional and organizational arrangements
and problems in the current system is also discussed in the chapter.

T1  - Inherent vulnerability assessment of rural households based on socio-economic indicators using categorical principal component analysis: A case study of Kimsar region, Uttarakhand

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - The recent trend of shifting focus from hazard centric drivers of
vulnerability towards the social and economic drivers of vulnerability
has led to a number of conceptual frameworks for social vulnerability
assessment. Contributing towards this growing trend of social
vulnerability assessment, this study proposes a framework to measure
inherent vulnerability, which is centered on hazard generic and
livelihood oriented socioeconomic factors of vulnerability. Inherent
vulnerability is defined as the predisposition of a household to suffer
harm. The study focuses on the mountainous communities in Kimsar region,
located in Uttarakhand state, India. The communities in the region
suffer from multiple stressors including extreme precipitation, drought,
landslides, cloudbursts and flash floods. Vulnerability indicators with
mixed scaling are used, to capture household's perception and other
socio-economic attributes, which contribute towards its inherent
vulnerability. Data was collected by conducting household surveys in
nine villages of Kimsar region. In order to process the indicators with
mixed scaling, and obtain an empirical summary of the data set, the
method of Non-Linear Principal Component Analysis was used for computing
a household level Inherent Vulnerability Index. Results obtained
revealed that principal components explaining a major variance in the
data set were access to employment opportunities, effectiveness of local
government, access to food, occupational diversity, access to resources,
educational attainment and access to water. It was observed that the
villages of Dharkot, Kandakhal and Bhumiyakisar have the highest
percentage of households, which were relatively less vulnerable to
environmental stressors. Higher vulnerability was observed in majority
of households in the village Kimsar, Ramjeewala and Malls Banas. A
majority of households in Talla Banas, Jogiyana and Kasan were
moderately vulnerable. Inherent vulnerability assessment has the
potential to predict the future harm a household might suffer due to
hazard events.

T1  - Landscape vulnerability and rehabilitation issues: a study of hydropower projects in Garhwal region, Himalaya
A1  - Sati, Vishwambhar Prasad
Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - The Himalaya is known for its rich biodiversity, and it supports the
Indian subcontinent with wide varieties of natural resources including
the life-sustaining water. Its huge potential to develop
micro-hydropower projects is untapped. Large-scale multi-purpose river
valley projects are not feasible as the landscape of Garhwal region is
highly vulnerable-ecologically fragile, geologically unstable and
tectonically and seismically active. Here, the issues of landscape
vulnerability and rehabilitation, due to the construction of hydropower
projects, are renowned. In Garhwal region, the hydropower projects,
which have been constructed and are under construction and proposed, are
located in the densely populated river valleys, where terraced arable
land is also available. These areas are highly prone to atmospherically
triggered hazards-debris flows, flash floods, landslides, mass movements
and rockfalls. Rehabilitation of the affected population has been
remaining as a major challenge in all the river valley projects from the
very onset of the commencement of hydropower projects in Garhwal region.
This paper examines the landscape vulnerability and rehabilitation
issues related to the hydropower projects in Garhwal region, Himalaya.
The author collected the data from the primary and secondary sources and
from the rapid field visits of the hydropower project sites. This study
reveals that only micro-level hydropower projects are feasible in the
fragile landscape of the Garhwal Himalaya, keeping vulnerability and
rehabilitation issues in mind.

AB  - Vulnerability to natural hazards is spatially variable, and these
variations are not necessarily in direct proportion to physical risk.
Other variables come into play, including those related to the nature of
the hazard, in this case flash floods, and those related to
socio-economic and land use variables, and all of these might be
influenced by political decision-making. These data can be incorporated
as separate data layers in a Geographic Information System, thus
facilitating analysis of spatial patterns as well as providing the basis
for determining measures of vulnerability; a number of methods have been
developed. These methods take into account probability of occurrence,
indices of the spatial extent, and characteristics of the community at
risk. Community is sometimes defined by spatial boundaries and other
times by characteristics such as age or mobility, and the proportion or
absolute number of people and amount of property at risk. Despite these
advances, little work has been done to evaluate methods of defining and
depicting social vulnerability. This is addressed by testing three
methods in a case study community.

PD  - 
AB  - Given their unique natural attractions, including the highest mountain
range in the world, the Nepalese Himalayas have long been a Mecca for
trekkers and mountaineers. Nature-based tourism in the Nepalese
Himalayas, however, is highly vulnerable to change in climatic
conditions. This paper proposes a conceptual framework based on Jodha's
mountain specificities, which include inaccessibility, fragility,
marginality, diversity and niche, to examine the impacts and
vulnerability of climate change on tourism in the Himalayas, with the
cases of the three most popular protected areas of Nepal - Mt Everest
National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area and Chitwan National Park -
located in three physiographic zones. Each physiographic zone differs
greatly and hence presents potentially different impacts and
vulnerability to climate change. Avalanches and glacial lake outburst
floods are the major hazards in high mountains; landslides, debris flows
and flash floods are common in the hills; and floods are rampant in
lowland Terai. The effects of these climate-related hazards on tourism
are further exacerbated by mountain characteristics.

AB  - The assessment of regional climate change impacts combined with the
sensitivity of landscape functions by predictive modelling of hazardous
landscape processes is a new fundamental field of research. In
particular, this study investigates the effects of changing weather
extremes on meso-regional-scale landscape vulnerability.
Climatic-exposure parameter analysis was performed on a predicted
climate change scenario. The exposure to climate change was analysed on
the basis of the original data of the meso-scale IPCC A1B climate
scenario from the REMO and ALADIN regional models for the periods of
2021-2050 and 2071-2100, and the regional types of climate change
impacts were calculated by using cluster analysis. Selected climate
exposure parameters of the REMO and ALADIN models were analysed, in
particular, for extreme events (days with precipitation greater than 30
mm, heat waves, dry periods, wet periods) and for daily temperature and
precipitation. The landscape functions impacted by climate change are
proxies for the main recent and future problematic processes in Hungary.
Soil erosion caused by water, drought, soil erosion caused by wind, mass
movement and flash floods were analysed for the time periods of
1961-1990, 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. Based on the sensitivity thresholds
for the impact assessments, the landscape functional sensitivity
indicators were interpreted, and an integrative summary of the five
indicators was made, differentiating the regions facing only a few or
multiple sensitivities. In Central Hungary, the increasing exposure and
sensitivity to droughts will be a serious problem when following the
REMO scenario. In several regions, most indicators will change the
sensitivity threshold from a tolerable risk to an increased or very high
risk.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - A questionnaire survey was conducted to understand how a mountain
ecosystem in northern Bhutan is perceived by local yak herders to be
changing under climate warming. One hundred elderly herders were
selected using a 2-stage sampling. The questionnaire sought information
on herders' awareness and perceptions of weather patterns, climate
changes, and their impact on vegetation, herding practices, and
livelihoods. Most study participants were aware of global warming. They
perceived that global warming has led to warmer and longer vegetation
growing periods, increased rainfall, decreased water availability, more
frequent droughts, the ascent of snow lines, and an increase in flash
floods and landslides. Many herders also perceived that vegetation is
growing faster, new vegetation is gradually becoming established in
formerly barren lands, and meadows have been encroached on by
rhododendrons, which has reduced grassland size and caused a decline in
forage availability and quality. Warming was perceived to have caused
difficulties in herding and transhumant migration. It was also perceived
to have caused a decrease in milk production and increase in livestock
predation, which affected the livelihoods of herders who rely on yak.
The study concluded that yak herders' perceptions provide critical signs
of warming and their vulnerability to changing climatic conditions in
the alpine environment.

AB  - Purpose - Tropical storms pose a significant threat to population
despite the noteworthy improvements in forecasting and emergency
management. Following the effects of Hurricane Sandy in the continental
North America (USA and Canada) and the Caribbean, the purpose of this
paper is to examine the mortality caused by the hurricane, focussing on
differences in human vulnerability between these two regions.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed a database of 233
deaths, consisting of variables that provided a description of the
circumstances under which the fatal incidents occurred and demographic
details of the victims.
Findings - Analysis of the database showed higher percentages of female
and young victims in the Caribbean than in continental North America,
where mortality increased progressively with age and the ratio of males
to females was higher. The majority of deaths occurred outdoors
especially during clean-up and in vehicle crashes related to the storm.
Physical trauma and drowning were identified as the most common causes
of death, followed by carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and others,
although substantially different percentages were recorded between the
two regions. Overall, indirect deaths presented a higher percentage than
direct ones. Among the latter, incidents caused by storm surge and tree
falls showed the highest numbers. Power failure and car crashes were the
most common cause of indirect incidents.
Originality/value - The paper provides a thorough analysis of the
circumstances under which fatal incidents occurred. It identifies
parameters that affected the vulnerability of human life to the storm
and discusses the differences between the Caribbean and continental
North America.

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - This paper intends to discuss landscape resilience as a way of reducing
disaster risk in the island of Madeira. Maderia is a Portuguese
Macaronesian island that is located in the Atlantic Ocean and frequently
affected by natural hazards. Here, the concept of resilience is
discussed as a dichotomous and place-based concept and as a way of
achieving sustainability, sustainability being one of the main solutions
for climate change. This paper will discuss the complexity of defining
``resilience{''}, the contradictions involved in its use and its
positive and negative applications. In order to make resilience an
operative concept, it is investigated within landscape research, in
which landscape is considered to be the result of human and natural
actions and their interaction. Here, landscape is considered as a
holistic, place-based, bottomup concept that can be used as a unit of
measure for community resilience. As a consequence of the kind of
relationship that a community builds with the landscape in which it
lives, we can encounter different kinds of lansdscapes: riskscapes,
hazardscapes, resilientscapes, sustainable landscapes, etc. These
landscapes are investigated in the context of the island of Madeira in
order to identify the resilient actions of its community. To conclude,
today, Madeira is a riskscape and often a hazardscape. The most recent
incidents were the fires of 2013 and the flash flood of 2010, which was
one of the worst events in the history of the archipelago. However, the
first signs of resilience have been identified, which represent
interesting examples of increasing awareness in both top-down and
bottom-up ways. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

A1  - Tuyet, D
Y1  - 2001///
PD  - 
AB  - Karst in Vietnam covers an area of about 60,000 km(2), i.e. 18 % of the
surface of the country. The country has an annual average temperature of
24 degreesC, an annual average rainfall of 2300 nun and a relative
humidity of about 90%. Karst in Vietnam is typified by peak
cluster-depression landscapes ranging in elevation from 200 to over 2000
m. Tower and coastal karst landscapes also exit. Because of naturally
favourable conditions, karst ecosystems are diverse and very rich.
Higher plants(cormophytes) are abundant. They are represented by
approximately 2000 species, 908 genera, 224 families, 86 orders and 7
phyla. They form a thick vegetation cover of evergreen tropical
rainforest. Knowledge about lower plants is limited. The fauna is rich
and diverse. Phyla such as Protozoa, Vermes, Mollusca and Arthropoda are
yet ill known. Preliminary results show that the phylum Chordata is
represented by 541 species from 80 families, 40 orders and 5 classes.
There exist many precious and rare mammals, in particular some endemic
species such as Trachypithecus poliocephalus, T. delacouri,
Rhinopithecus avanculus, Rhinolophus rouxi, Seotoma dineties and Silurus
cuephuongensis. The class Insecta has about 2000 species.
The fast population growth, particularly in the mountainous areas of the
country, triggers an increasing demand for land and therefore threatens
the ecosystem. To obtain land for farming, people have cut, burned and
destroyed natural forest cover; resulting in occurrence of hazards such
as soil-loss, water-loss, flash floods, mud-rock flows, rock-falls,
severe drought, water logging and changes of karstic aquifers etc.
Poaching precious animals and illegal logging are increasing. In
contrast to other natural systems, karst ecosystems cannot be
reestablished once damaged. Living karst landscapes will become rocky
desert ones without life. Conservation of karstic environmental systems
in general and karstic ecosystems in particular should not be the sole
vocation of scientists but also a duty and responsibility of authorities
and people from all levels. A good example of a multidisciplinary
approach to karst-related problems is the implementation of the
Vietnamese-Belgian Karst Project (VBEKAP): ``Rural development in the
mountain karst area of NW Vietnam by sustainable water and land
management and social learning: its conditions and facilitation{''}. The
aim of this project is to improve living conditions of local people and
sustained protection and management of the karst environment and
ecosystem.

AB  - Batu is a city located in the mountainous area and the elevation of
700-3000 m above sea level. Batu is surrounded by two volcanoes: Mount
Kelud and Mount Welirang. These natural conditions give potential
vulnerability to the society as it has high potential for disasters that
can take place at any time. To manage the significant risk, Regional
Disaster Management Agency or BPBD made policies and laws to the
community through the ``Desa Tangguh Bencana: Disaster Resilient Village
(Destana){''}. The aim of this paper is to explain how local capacity in
disaster risk reduction. The research method used descriptive
qualitative approach. Data are collected by conducting field surveys,
interviews, and information from relevant agencies. The results show
that disaster index score of Batu is 134, which is categorized in the
medium level. The evidence is natural disasters have occurred. There
were a flash flood, Mt. Kelud erupted, landslide and forest fires. Batu
has three disaster resilient villages: Gunungsari Village, Pandanrejo
Village, and Sisir Village. Gunungsari Village and Pandanrejo Village
belonging Pratama level, Sisir Village belonging Madya level. Human
resources become a significant factor influencing the effectiveness of
Destana's policy implementation. One of the Destana's principles is that
society becomes the primary factor in the efforts to create disaster
resilient community. Therefore, it is the society that actively
participates in the implementation of this Destana's policy ranging from
policy-making, conduct capacity building efforts to prepare for disaster
and manage resources in order to reduce vulnerability and disaster risk.
The other factors to support the effectiveness of Destana's policy
implementation is cooperation and synergy among stakeholders. The
Government of Batu, BNPB, and BPBD Batu City played a quite important
role is providing technical and financial assistance in the three
villages.

T1  - KARST GEO-HAZARDS: CAUSAL FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT ISSUES
A1  - Parise, Mario
Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Karst terranes exhibit spectacular landforms that are often exploited as
natural parks and show caves, and hosts very important natural
resources. Further, karst terranes cover 20% of the Earth's surface and
provides 20-25% of high-quality ground-water for drinking water. The
fragility of karst environments makes it highly vulnerable to a variety
of different geological hazards (or geo-hazards). This is due to its
peculiar geological and hydrological features such as sinkholes and
caves. In particular, the strict connection between surface and
subsurface features emphasizes the fragile nature of karst. The
occurrence of geo-hazards in karst terranes greatly differs from other
natural settings. Natural and man-induced subsidence and sinkholes,
slope movements favored by karst conduits and caves, flash floods
related to inability of the system to manage water from heavy
rainstorms, and pollution caused directly or indirectly by human actions
are the main types of geo-hazards typical of karst terranes. Although
mostly related to natural processes, their occurrence and consequent
damage to both the natural and anthropogenic environment are often
caused or exacerbated by man. As a consequence, management of karst
terranes cannot be enacted without taking into account the peculiar
features and behavior of karst terranes and aquifers, and the delicate
balance with the different types of geo- hazards that may occur.
Specific management actions should, therefore, be pursued in this
fragile environment, with the intention of safeguarding the natural
resources, biota, and population.

AB  - The Mediterranean countries are experiencing important challenges.
related to the water cycle, including water shortages and floods,
extreme winds, and ice/snow storms, that impact critically the
socioeconomic vitality in the area (causing damage to property,
threatening lives, affecting the energy and transportation sectors,
etc.). There are gaps in our understanding of the Mediterranean water
cycle and its dynamics that include the variability of the Mediterranean
Sea water budget and its feedback on the variability of the continental
precipitation through air-sea interactions, the impact of precipitation
variability on aquifer recharge, river discharge, and soil water content
and vegetation characteristics specific to the Mediterranean basin and
the mechanisms that control the location and intensity of heavy
precipitating systems that often produce floods. The Hydrological Cycle
in Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX) program is a 10-yr concerted
experimental effort at the international level that aims to advance the
scientific knowledge of the water cycle variability in all compartments
(land, sea, and atmosphere) and at various time and spatial scales. It
also aims to improve the processes-based models needed for forecasting
hydrometeorological extremes and the models of the regional climate
system for predicting regional climate variability and evolution.
Finally, it aims to assess the social and economic vulnerability to
hydrometeorological natural hazards in the Mediterranean and the
adaptation capacity of the territories and populations therein to
provide support to policy makers to cope with water-related problems
under the influence of climate change, by linking scientific outcomes
with related policy requirements.

AB  - The road network in the Himalayan terrain, connecting remote areas
either in the valleys or on the hill slopes, plays a pivotal role in
socio-economic development of India. The planning, development and even
maintenance of road and rail networks in such precarious terrains are
always a challenging task because of complexities posed by topography,
geological structures, varied lithology and neotectonics. Increasing
population and construction of roads have led to destabilisation of
slopes, thus leading to mass wasting and movement, further aggravation
due to recent events of cloud bursts and unprecedented flash floods.
Vulnerability analysis of slopes is an important component for the
``Landslide Hazard Assessment{''} and ``Slope Mass Characterisation{''}
guide planners to predict and choose suitable ways for construction of
roads and other engineering structures. The problem of landslides along
the national highway-58 (NH-58) from Rishikesh to Devprayag is a common
scene. The slopes along the NH-58 between Jonk and Rishikesh were
investigated, which experienced very heavy traffic especially from March
to August due to pilgrimage to Kedarnath shrine. On the basis of slope
mass rating (SMR) investigation, the area falls in stable class, and
landslide susceptibility score (LSS) values also indicate that the
slopes under investigation fall in low to moderate vulnerability to
landslide. More attentions should be paid to the slopes to achieve
greater safe and economic benefits along the highway. (C) 2015 Institute

AB  - The Central African region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Rwanda and Burundi is little known in international geomorphic and
natural hazard literature. In an attempt to gather some primary
information for this 2.400.000 km(2) white patch on the map, the
geomorphology and remote sensing division of the RMCA has recently
launched the ``Natural Hazards Database for Central Africa{''}, which
integrates information from diverse sources on natural hazards having
occurred in the region since 1910. The database records some 241 events
for the period 1910-2009, having resulted in 1959 deaths and affected
over 12,2 million people. The database forms a basis for investigation
into the spatial and temporal trends in hazard occurrence in Central
Africa. Preliminary results show that the region of the Congo Basin is
more geomorphologically active than first thought, and that there is an
especially high frequency of events along the Albertine rift zone
encompassing the Kivu provinces in DRC, Rwanda and Burundi. It is not so
much the magnitude of events, but their frequency that has resulted in
widespread material and human losses. Events of hydrological origin such
as mass movements and flash and wash floods are becoming increasingly
important, and the number thereof has been seen to rise exponentially
since 2000. Although it has not as yet been included in our databank,
fieldwork suggests that urban gullying also forms an increasingly
important threat. We attribute this increase in frequency of events to
the accelerated urbanisation in the region over the last few decades.

AB  - This study presents the geological and geomorphological surveys that
relate to hazards in the Ponci Valley, considered in light of an
important archaeological site from the Roman era, in order to define its
state of vulnerability. This site contains the remains of Via Iulia
Augusta, built along this valley 2000 years ago. Five bridges cross the
road which is between 150 m and 300 m in altitude. These constitute the
most important and monumental traces of the Roman communication routes
in Liguria. Since the Pietra di Finale (bioclastic limestone) is largely
found in this area, this rock is mainly used for building these bridges,
supplemented by dolomitic limestone, quartzites and other schists.
The lithological features, geomorphological evolution and
morpho-structural relationships between the outcropping lithotypes
caused the formation of karstic landforms and hypogeal phenomena through
rainfall infiltration and underground water flow. This study highlights
the geological, environmental and cultural value of this site, which is
acknowledged as a ``geosite{''} of Mediterranean importance with respect
to geomorphological risk scenarios. Firm hazard reduction measures are
needed, in particular related to flash floods, rockslides and sinkhole
events that could affect the Roman bridge remains.

AB  - Climate change would lead to such hydrometeorological disaster as:
flash-flood, landslide, hailstone, lightning, and twister become more
likely to happen in the future. In terms of lightning event, one
research question arise of where lightning would be mostly to strike
over the Maritime Continent (MC)?. The objective of the research is to
investigate region with high-density of lightning activity over MC by
mapping climatological features of lightning flashes derived from
onboard NASA-TRMM Satellite, i.e. Optical Transient Detector/Lightning
Imaging Sensor (OTD/LIS). Based on data retrieved since 1995-2013, it is
seasonally observed that during transition season March to May, region
with high vulnerability of lightning flashes cover the entire Sumatra
Island, the Malacca Strait, and Peninsular Malaysia as well as Java
Island. High-frequent of lightning activity over the Malacca Strait is
unique since it is the only sea-region in the world where lightning
flashes are denser. As previously mentioned that strong lightning
activity over the strait is driven by mesoscale convective system of
Sumatra Squalls due to convergences of land breeze between Sumatra and
Peninsular Malaysia. Lightning activity over the strait is continuously
observed throughout season despite the intensity reduced. Java Island,
most populated island, receive high-density of lightning flashes during
rainy season (December to February) but small part in the northwestern
of Java Island, e.g., Bogor and surrounding areas, the density of
lightning flashes are high throughout season. Northern and southern
parts of Kalimantan and Central part of Sulawesi are also prone to
lightning activity particularly during transition season March to May
and September to November. In the eastern part of MC, Papua receive
denser lightning flashes during September to November. It is found that
lightning activity are mostly concentrated over land instead of ocean
which is in accordance with diurnal convective precipitation event due
to the existence of numerous mountainous island in MC. The malacca
strait however is the only exception and turn into a unique
characteristic of convective system over MC and the only sea-region in
the world where lightning activity is the greatest.

PD  - 
AB  - Contributions presented at the international NeoFishMed workshop on New
Approaches for Assessing the Impacts of Non-native Freshwater Fishes in
the Mediterranean Region are reviewed. Rivers in Mediterranean-climate
regions are characterised by a dynamic hydrology, resulting in severe
droughts during summer and flash flooding in winter. These types of
systems, when disturbed by human actions, seem to be particularly
suitable to the establishment of non-native freshwater fish species
(i.e. where the natural, highly variable hydrological conditions have
been replaced by regulated discharge regimes as a result of reservoir
construction). The Mediterranean region is considered one of the six
global invasion hotspots, with non-native freshwater fishes representing
>25% of all fish species in riverine assemblages. From a conservation
perspective, this region is characterised by increased competition for
scarce water resources as well as high endemicity and biodiversity. Key
points on introduction pathways, ecosystem vulnerability and human
impacts, as well as future trends for the Mediterranean region, are
presented. A case is made to develop, using innovative analyses,
evidence-based assessments of impacts by non-native species on
Mediterranean ecosystem vulnerability to underpin the development of
future policy and appropriate management tools.

PD  - 
AB  - Archaeological excavations have exposed a shocking picture of the
prehistorical catastrophes in the Lajia Ruins in the upper Yellow River.
The grouped skeletons resting on the dwelling floors show a vivid scene
of the mortal struggle of human being during catastrophes. Geological
records of the major disasters in relation to the devastation of this
prehistorical settlement were investigated by detailed field
observations, sedimentological analysis and optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) and C-14 dating. The results show that the
prehistorical community of the Qijia Culture migrated into the Guanting
Basin at c. 4200 yr BP. They chose the loess-blanketed riverbanks to
build their settlement and cultivate millet crops. At c. 3950 yr BP,
immediately followed by a major earthquake, the settlement was overtaken
by immense mudflows coming along the tributary gullies from the
hillsides behind. The enormous mudflows suddenly buried and destroyed
the dwellings and killed the women and children at their homes. The
source of the catastrophic mudflows was traced upslope to the gully
heads behind the ruins, where the palaeoearthquake together with the
rainstorms and flash floods induced enormous mass wasting on the
hillsides. Referring to the causations of the catastrophic debris flows
and landslides in the region, it is inferred that the soil erosion, mass
wasting and accumulation of debris on the hillsides were intensified
largely by human disturbance of the landscape by bush clearance from
6000 yr BP to 3950 yr BP. During the climate event of 4200-4000 yr BP,
enhanced human activities and over-exploitation of natural resources
increased the vulnerability of the communities to detrimental
environmental change and catastrophe. This means that the prehistorical
catastrophic mudflows were created partly by the early settlers
themselves. These results are of important implications in understanding
the prehistorical environmental change in the environmentally sensitive
zones over the world.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to investigate and to improve
understanding of the causes and circumstances of flood disaster deaths.
A standardised method of classifying flood deaths is proposed and the
difficulties associated with comparing and assessing existing
information on flood deaths are discussed. Thirteen flood cases from
Europe and the United States, resulting in 247 flood disaster
fatalities, were analysed and taken as indicative of flood disaster
deaths. Approximately two-thirds of the deaths occurred through
drowning. Thus, a substantial number of flood disaster fatalities are
not related to drowning. Furthermore, males are highly vulnerable to
dying in floods and unnecessary risk-taking behaviour contributes
significantly to flood disaster deaths. Based on these results,
recommendations are made to prevent loss of life in floods. To provide a
more solid basis for the formulation of prevention strategies, better
systematic recording of flood fatalities is suggested, especially those
caused by different types of floods in all countries.

PD  - 
AB  - The ability of attackers to rapidly gain control of vast numbers of
Internet hosts poses an immense risk to the overall security of the
Internet. Once subverted, these hosts can not only be used to launch
massive denial of service floods, but also to steal or corrupt great
quantities of sensitive information, and confuse and disrupt use of the
network in more subtle ways.
We present an analysis of the magnitude of the threat. We begin with a
mathematical model derived from empirical data of the spread of Code Red
I in July, 2001. We discuss techniques subsequently employed for
achieving greater virulence by Code Red 11 and Nimda. In this context,
we develop and evaluate several new, highly virulent possible
techniques: hit-list scanning (which creates a Warhol worm), permutation
scanning (which enables self-coordinating scanning), and use of
Internet-sized hit-lists (which creates a flash worm).
We then turn to the to the threat of surreptitious worms that spread
more slowly but in a much harder to detect ``contagion{''} fashion. We
demonstrate that such a worm today could arguably subvert upwards of
10,000,000 Internet hosts. We also consider robust mechanisms by which
attackers can control and update deployed worms.
In conclusion, we argue for the pressing need to develop a ``Center for
Disease Control{''} analog for virus and worm-based threats to national
cybersecurity, and sketch some of the components that would go into such
a Center.

AB  - Worldwide, flood is the number one cause of losses from natural events.
Flood insurance has attracted more and more attention in recent years,
not only in the fields of science and politics but also within the
insurance industry itself. Although the list of great natural disasters
is headed by storms, and despite the relatively low density of insurance
against flooding, the large number of local flood events constitutes a
large interest for the insurance industry. Flooding comes in various
forms, ranging from storm surges to flash floods and from sometimes
country-wide river floods to glacial lake outburst and dam break floods.
These different forms of flooding are important when it comes to
insurance concepts, for which adverse selection plays an important role.
Various concepts for the field of flood insurance have been investigated
and discussed in different countries. In Germany, the insurance
industry, in a combined effort, has launched a project to identify zones
of similar risk resulting from river floods for the whole country. The
identification of possible clients and the calculation of premiums are
two uses of the developed model, as well as the assessment of probable
maximum losses. Only river floods are considered in the model, flash
floods and storm surges are excluded; flood control measures are not
taken into account either.

AB  - Enhanced management of water systems requires knowledge of the amounts
of water availability on time scales of hours to decades. Managers of
water systems can use the information from combined
hydro-meteorological/hydrologic prediction models to take appropriate
actions in a real-time basis and also to plan the development of both
structural and non-structural measures. Cooperation between the
meteorological and hydrological communities is leading to improved
models, from flash floods to climate change scenarios but there is a
continuing need for dialogue to understand the needs and capabilities of
each community. This paper reviews the role of prediction and discusses
different kinds of predictions: deterministic, probabilistic, and
scenarios based on external forcing. An important issue is the factoring
in of the uncertainties of predictions into a risk management approach
to water systems management.

AB  - Possible future violent events in the active hydrothermal, magmatic, and
tectonic system of Yellowstone National Park pose potential hazards to
park visitors and infrastructure. Most of the national park and vicinity
are sparsely populated, but significant numbers of people as well as
park resources could nevertheless be at risk from these hazards.
Depending on the nature and magnitude of a particular hazardous event
and the particular time and season when it might occur, 70,000 to more
than 100,000 persons could be affected; the most violent events could
affect a broader region or even continent-wide areas. This assessment of
such hazards is presented both as a guide for future activities of the
Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) and to aid appropriate response
planning by the National Park Service and surrounding agencies and
communities. Although the assessment is presented here in some technical
detail, this summary is intended to be understandable to non-scientists.
The principal conclusions also will be made available in other forms,
more accessible to general readers.
The Yellowstone Plateau was built by one of Earth's largest young
volcanic systems, having episodically erupted great volumes of both lava
and explosively ejected pumiceous ash for more than 2 million years.
These eruptive materials are products of two compositional types of
subsurface magma: basaltic magma is relatively fluid and, in this
setting, generally produces small to moderate volumes of lava in
relatively brief eruptions; rhyolitic magma is more viscous and either
can erupt effusively to produce small to large volumes of lava or
explosively to produce coarse pumice and finer ash. The three largest
Yellowstone eruptions produced blanketing deposits of rhyolitic ash so
hot that they welded into sheets of dense rock covering large areas,
extending beyond the national park. Each of them also produced a rain of
ash that spread over much of western and central North America and
beyond; these ash deposits are greater than 2 m thick near their
eruptive sources and as much as a meter thick in Surrounding areas. Each
of these three eruptions produced a caldera, or deep crater-like
depression, tens of kilometers wide, formed by collapse of the ground
surface into a partly emptied subterranean magma chamber. The latest of
these three great eruptions formed the Yellowstone caldera. Renewed
rhyolitic magma influx beneath the Yellowstone caldera in central
Yellowstone National Park uplifted parts of the caldera floor and
produced voluminous intracaldera lavas, the youngest of which extruded
in a series of eruptive episodes about 164,000, 152,000, 114,000,
102,000, and 72,000 years ago. During the same span of time, generally
smaller flows of both basalt and rhyolite have erupted in several areas
outside the Yellowstone caldera: (1) northwest of the caldera, (2) near
the southern boundary of the park, (3) in the basin of Island Park, west
of Yellowstone National Park, and (4) especially in the southern part of
a corridor between Norris Geyser Basin and Mammoth Hot Springs.
Disruption of the Earth's surface by faulting and regional uplift
characterize the geologic framework of Yellowstone Plateau volcanism.
Some of the regional faults that bound the mountain ranges around the
Yellowstone Plateau are capable of producing large-magnitude (M>7)
earthquakes. In contrast, faults within the caldera are mainly small,
produce smaller-magnitude (M 6.8), relatively shallow earthquakes, and
reflect strains in the Earth's crust associated with magmatic intrusion
and hydrothermal activity. Swarms of generally small earthquakes
occurring within localized areas over restricted periods of time
characterize much of the earthquake activity within and adjacent to the
Yellowstone caldera. This seismicity is monitored by a network of
seismographs within and adjacent to the park and is recorded and
processed nearly in real time at the University of Utah as part of the
YVO program and archived as a contribution to the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) Advanced National Seismic System database.
Leveling surveys, satellite-based measurements, and geologic studies of
former shorelines of Yellowstone Lake all show that the entire area of
the Yellowstone caldera and a seismically active zone to the northwest
undergo episodes of ground uplift and subsidence, sometimes encompassing
the entire caldera and sometimes in more local and complex patterns of
both uplift and subsidence. Such deformation in the Yellowstone region
is monitored by YVO mainly through a network of continuously recorded
Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers recorded at the University of
Utah. The GPS data are incorporated as part of the National Science
Foundation's EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, archived at UNAVCO
and available through the YVO website

The active hydrothermal system of Yellowstone National Park is one of
the largest on Earth. Although accidents involving hot water injure
Yellowstone visitors from time to time, conformance with normal Park
Service procedures and regulations would ordinarily be sufficient to
prevent most of them. By contrast, a commonly recurring, more acute
hazard at Yellowstone is the explosive ejection of steam, water, and
rock with no associated volcanism. These hydrothermal explosions are
caused by hot subsurface waters that flash to steam, breaking the
overlying rocks that confine them and ejecting the debris to form a
crater. It is generally not clear just what triggers these events, but
possible triggers include strong local earthquakes, seasonal or
long-term declines in ground water levels, and changes in the
underground distribution of heat. Many hydrothermal explosions have few
if any premonitory indications.
At least 26 hydrothermal explosions have been documented in the 126-year
historic record of the national park, and others undoubtedly escaped
observation. Since the Yellowstone Plateau was last glaciated, ending
about 16,000 years ago, at least 18 large hydrothermal explosions have
formed craters wider than 100 m. Conservatively, at least one
rock-hurling explosion every two years is estimated to occur at
Yellowstone, but because most of these events are small and usually
Occur when few visitors are present, the likelihood of harm to park
visitors is relatively small. The average recurrence of an explosion
that could cause personal injury is probably between 10 and 100 years.
Average recurrence time of an explosion large enough to produce a
100-m-diameter crater is probably about 200 years, but such an event
could expel rocks and other hot debris more than 2 km from the explosion
site. Most hydrothermal-explosion craters at Yellowstone are in the
Firehole River geyser basins, beneath or around Yellowstone Lake, and in
the southern part of the Norris- Mammoth Corridor.
In addition to hydrothermal explosions, toxic gases-mainly carbon
dioxide and hydro-en sulfide-pose hazards. Concentrations of these gases
in the atmosphere are generally low at Yellowstone, but they can build
Lip in confined areas such as valleys, caves, and tunnels, especially
during windless conditions. Most areas with toxic-gas hazards can be
kept off-limits to people, but gas emissions should continue to be
monitored.
No volcanic eruption has Occurred in Yellowstone National Park or
vicinity in the last 70,000 years or more. Nevertheless, several types
of volcanic eruption hazards are possible in the future.
Basaltic lavas have erupted around the margins of the Yellowstone
Plateau volcanic field throughout its evolution. These relatively
low-viscosity lavas generally erupt rapidly, most eruptions lasting no
more than a few weeks to a few months though the largest flow fields may
accumulate in multiple eruptions lasting months to years. The average
period between basaltic eruptions in the Yellowstone region since
formation of the Yellowstone caldera has been about 16,000 years. The
most likely location of a future basaltic eruption is within the basin
of Island Park, west of Yellowstone, but basalts could erupt anywhere in
a 40-km-wide band around the caldera. Future basaltic eruptions could
cover several square kilometers with lava up to tens of meters thick.
Basaltic ash and cinders also might blanket hundreds of square
kilometers to depths of a few meters to a few centimeters, and if a vent
emerged beneath water or saturated ground, more explosive eruptions
could cause significant destruction, such as blasting down trees or
structures.
Large rhyolitic lava flows, many having volumes greater than 10 km(3),
have erupted within the Yellowstone caldera during the past 170,000
years. Initially these larger eruptions were preceded by explosively
ejected pumice and ash. In a similar future eruption, ejecta could bury
broad areas, locally to many meters. Subsequent lava extrusion could
last for years, covering areas as great as 350-400 km2 to thicknesses of
tens or hundreds of meters and volumes of 5 to more than 50 km3. Because
such voluminous rhyolitic lava eruptions have not been observed anywhere
in historical time, it is uncertain how long such an event might
continue; extrusion might be orders of magnitude faster than for smaller
flows. The probability of a future large intracaldera rhyolitic eruption
is difficult to estimate. Available data suggest a highly episodic
behavior of past eruptions of this sort, periods of a few thousand years
characterized by numerous eruptions being separated by longer intervals
of about 12,000 to 38,000 years without eruption. One statistical
measure of eruption probabilities based on this episodic behavior
suggests an average recurrence of 20,000 years. The fact that no such
eruption has occurred for more than 70,000 years may mean that
insufficient eruptible magma remains beneath the Yellowstone caldera to
produce another largevolume lava flow.
Small rhyolitic lava flows postdating the Yellowstone caldera have
erupted mainly north of the caldera, but one such flow also lies near
the South Entrance to the park. Two distinct types of primary hazards
might be associated with small rhyolitic eruptions at Yellowstone. Just
as for larger rhyolitic lava eruptions, initial venting almost certainly
would explosively eject rhyolitic pumice; the coarser fragments would
fall back close to the vent, but finer pumiceous ash would enter the
atmosphere and fall downwind for many kilometers. Structures, power
lines, etc. could be damaged by ash loading, especially if eruption were
accompanied by heavy rain. The initial explosive eruptions could last a
few hours to several weeks and be followed by viscous extrusion of
rhyolitic lava, covering several square kilometers to tens of meters
thick; lava could continue to extrude for many months or even years.
Viscous rhyolitic lava would advance much more slowly than a basaltic
flow; most affected facilities could be safely evacuated and perhaps
relocated. The average recurrence period of small extracaldera rhyolitic
eruptions in the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field is about 50,000
years.
In addition to the primary hazards posed by any future eruption of
basalt or a small or large rhyolitic lava eruption, important possible
secondary consequences include wildland fires, debris flows, and floods
triggered by the displacement of surface drainages by lava.
Systematic seismic, deformation, and hydrothermal monitoring by YVO is
likely to provide indicators of any impending volcanic eruptive activity
in Yellowstone National Park. Premonitory events detected by such
monitoring might include multiple shallow earthquake swarms of
increasing frequency and intensity, the ground vibrations called
volcanic tremor, localized uplift of the surface, ground cracks, and
anomalous gas emissions.
Of all the possible hazards from a future volcanic eruption in the
Yellowstone region, by far the least likely would be another explosive
caldera-forming eruption of great volumes of rhyolitic ash. Abundant
evidence indicates that hot magma continues to exist beneath
Yellowstone, but it is uncertain how much of it remains liquid, how well
the liquid is interconnected, and thus how much remains eruptible. Any
eruption of sufficient volume to form a new caldera probably would occur
only from within the present Yellowstone caldera, and the history of
postcaldera rhyolitic eruptions strongly suggests that the subcaldera
magma chamber is now a largely crystallized mush. The probability of
another major caldera-forming Yellowstone eruption, in the absence of
strong premonitory indications of major magmatic intrusion and degassing
beneath a large area of the caldera, can be considered to be below the
threshold of useful calculation.

AB  - Automated watering systems provide a reliable source of ad libitum water
to animal cages. Our facility uses an automated water delivery system to
support approximately 95% of the housed population (approximately
14,000 mouse cages). Drinking valve failure rates from 2002 through 2006
never exceeded the manufacturer standard of 0.1% total failure, based
on monthly cage census and the number of floods. In 2007, we noted an
increase in both flooding and cases of clinical dehydration in our mouse
population. Using manufacturer's specifications for a water flow rate of
25 to 50 mL/min, we initiated a wide-scale screening of all valves used.
During a 4-mo period, approximately 17,000 valves were assessed, of
which 2200 failed according to scoring criteria (12.9% overall; 7.2%
low flow; 1.6% no flow; 4.1% leaky). Factors leading to valve failures
included residual metal shavings, silicone flash, introduced debris or
bedding, and (most common) distortion of the autoclave-rated internal
diaphragm and O-ring. Further evaluation revealed that despite normal
autoclave conditions of heat, pressure, and steam, an extreme negative
vacuum pull caused the valves' internal silicone components (diaphragm
and O-ring) to become distorted and water-permeable. Normal flow rate
often returned after a `drying out' period, but components then
reabsorbed water while on the animal rack or during subsequent autoclave
cycles to revert to a variable flow condition. On the basis of our
findings, we recalibrated autoclaves and initiated a preventative
maintenance program to mitigate the risk of future valve failure.

T1  - TOWARDS RIVER REHABILITATION AS AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO FLOOD MANAGEMENT IN ASIAN CITIES
A1  - Higgitt, David L

Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - Flood management in Asian cities has conventionally been approached
through structural intervention where floods are regarded as a threat
requiring control through engineering infrastructure. Such a command and
control paradigm represents a marked transition from the way that
monsoon flood regimes have been traditionally perceived across Asia.
Rapid urbanization and climate change has imposed increasingly difficult
flood management challenges as an extension of impermeable surfaces
generates rapid runoff and flash flooding, while cities expand into
flood-prone areas. Property and communities are placed at enhanced risk.
Urbanization reallocates risk as channel and floodplain modification
influences flood regimes, while demands for flood protection at certain
locations can redistribute risk to other areas. An increasing concern
about flood hazard across Asian cities questions whether conventional
solutions reliant on structural intervention are sustainable. Such
questioning is mirrored by an alternative paradigm of rehabilitation in
integrated river basin management - a recognition that restoring and
sustaining functional river ecosystems with high biodiversity is one of
the greatest challenges facing society. Rehabilitation initiatives
demand a new approach to river basin management which encourage
interdisciplinary activity, particularly between engineers,
hydrologists, geomorphologists and ecologists. The paper sets out some
preliminary ideas from a research project investigating the potential
for river rehabilitation as a central tenet of flood management, with a
particular focus on Asian cities.

AB  - Rapid expansion of urban areas in Japan has resulted in widespread
destruction of forests and paddy fields, increasing the risk of flash
floods during heavy rainfall. While facilities such as dams, levees,
rainwater storage facilities, and infiltration facilities are typically
used to control flooding, constructing dams or large rainwater storage
facilities in certain catchments.
We investigated the adoption of ``smart{''} rainwater tanks, which are
tanks capable of sensing water level, monitoring outflow, and which
control flow output using pumps. The tanks are connected by a personal
area network, making it possible to collect monitoring data and to
control the water pumps remotely. Together, these connected tanks make
up a rainwater grid system. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), which
represents one of the unsupervised neural network techniques, has been
widely used for converting complex nonlinear multi-dimensional features
into visually-recognizable two-dimentional patterns. and when a self
organized map issues a flood warning, a pre-discharge command is sent to
the smart tanks in the rainwater grid system, instructing the water
tanks to discharge their contents.
We are planning to install this system in the Hii River Basin in
Fukuoka, Japan. A total of 106 200 L tanks have already been installed
for flood control. The tanks are capable of moderating the peak of a
heavy rainfall event and are suitable for experimenting with a grid
system. Most households with smart rainwater tanks residents have not
yet performed a pre-discharge; instead, the network of 106 tanks will be
automatically pre-discharged un the near future. The collected data is
stored using a cloud computer system, which can be accessed by the study
participants. In this way, participants can understand how the grid
works and how much rainwater is captured by the smart rainwater tanks.
Since the system of rainwater tanks functions as a high-density rain
gauge network, it can be used to monitor the amount of rainfall. An
X-band multi-parameter radar network with a spatial resolution of about
250 m(2) has been installed in the 29.1 km(2) catchment by the River
Bureau, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan.
The average density of the 106 tanks in the catchment area is 0.29
km(2), and the density of AMeDAS (Automated Meteorological Data
Acquisition System) rain gauge stations operated by the JMA(Japan
Meteological Agency) is about 17 km(2) per station. By using rainfall
data from this grid system, it will be possible to calibrate the
rainfall data observed by the X-band MP radar network.
In the near future, the sensor network for montoring and controling the
smart rainwater tanks will be integrated with smart meters and will
eventually be a component of a smart house, smart city and smart grid.

PD  - 
AB  - Maps are inherently reductive, abstract representations of our
environment. They create invisible boundaries, de-limiting zones for
cultural action. This is also their power maps reveal the hidden agendas
of their authors, but they also seek to make legible and communicate a
mentally abstract notion of the environment. Focusing specifically on
cities, architects have a history of invading the geographer's turf,
seeking to undermine (and capitalize on) the map with innovative
representational and notational systems to characterize the city's
complexities. These become the basis for future architectural action,
effectively merging the translation process of site analysis with the
design itself. This lineage of investigation into the city, breaking
down and re-coding elements and spaces, extends from Debord's Guide
Psychogeographique de Paris and Rowe and Koetter's Collage City, through
Venturi, Scott-Brown and Izenour's Learning from Las Vegas, to Kuroda
and Kaijima's Made in Tokyo. The project outlined in this paper seeks to
build on this lineage by using systems of notational and analytical
representation, examining infrastructure to reveal an invisible
evolution of change, outlining the traces left by the mapnnaker's hand
and in the city itself.
Water, as a piece of infrastructure in the city, is almost always the
spur of development. People are willing to live in swamps, drain land,
control floods and pretty much risk their lives in order to have access
to this resource. However, maps of water systems are fundamentally
fragmented, illustrating pieces of what is essentially invisibly linked
and sensitively dependent on our culturally embedded use at a local
level.
Albuquerque, New Mexico, began as an agricultural community building on
a hybrid of local and imported cultural traditions of irrigation from
Moorish Spain to the local Pueblos, shaping the way land was distributed
along the river. The city grew from Pueblo to Spanish fort town to
outpost of the Wild West to tuberculosis retreat to POW camp and nuclear
weapons development facility to the city it is today. Albuquerque is
also a desert town: water is not a simple life-giving resource - flash
flooding created dramatic shifts in the urban landscape, periodically
eradicating whole sections of the city. By analyzing and rennapping the
historical shifts, growth, and remnants of the infrastructure of water
as the city transformed through history, this paper explores alternate
representational systems to suggest strategies that might capitalize on
this infrastructure.

AB  - The study focused on analyzing the entire dynamics of small-scale mining
in Northern Mindanao by looking at the impact of mining on the community
in terms of environmental, socio-cultural, economics, production-market
flow and health toward responsible mining. The survey was conducted
through a survey and ocular visit in the mining sites namely: (1) Gango,
Libona, Bukidnon, (2) Barangay Tumpagon and (3) Barangay Pigsag-an in
Cagayan de Oro City, (4) Nangcaon, Opol, Misamis Oriental, and (5)
Rogongon, Iligan City, and had a total of 1,405 respondents who were
involved in mining and 60 key informants (barangay officials) who
participated in the discussion during the FGD. Results of the survey
indicated that mining is the main source of income among the respondents
from the five mining areas. In a specific mining site of Gango, drift
mining with tunneling system or underground mining is more appropriate
and preferred to this kind of mining area. The other four mining sites
engage in gold panning activities due to its location along the Iponan
River. ANOVA results revealed that gold production differed
significantly with respect to the mining sites. Regression analysis
showed the method of mining is the most important predictor that
contributed significantly to gold production with the highest gold value
of 24 karats. In the aspect of health, most miners from the five
selected areas are aware of the health risks and hazards associated with
mining. Most of them have experienced fracture, exacerbate shoulders,
and fatigue. Moreover, environmental impacts commonly mentioned by the
respondents were landslide, flash floods, soil erosion, biodiversity
loss, loss of organic fertility and soil-water contamination.

Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
Panama) with 43 mil inhabitants are located between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans in a territory of 522,300 km(2) with more than 13 mil
heads of cattle. Large areas of forest have been deforested and burned
for fuel wood or for agricultural use. The most important soil orders in
this region are: inceptisols, mollisols, alfisols, andisols and
ultisols. Deforestation and agriculture activities caused large-scale
erosion and soil loss and many areas are vulnerable to flash floods.
More than half of arable land of this region is estimated to be affected
by degradation processes. Due to these facts the aim of this study is to
review the risks for humans' health in this region; soil and/or dust and
mud including surface water were documented as a reservoirs and/or
vehicles of different causal agents of soil borne diseases (sapronoses
and saprozoonoses): viral infections (hanta pulmonary syndrome and
Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis), bacterial infections (anthrax and
leptospirosis) and parasitic infections (by protozoa caused bovine and
porcine cysticercosis and toxoplasmosis). Based on the OIE (World

AB  - Climate change presents many challenges for local government in
Victoria, Australia. In the Macedon Ranges local government area the
future climate is likely to include more hot days, less rainfall and
run-off and increased frequency and intensity of extreme events such as
drought, flash flooding and wildfire. The purpose of this project was to
identify, analyse and evaluate climate change risks and develop an
adaptation plan that would assist the Macedon Ranges Shire Council on
the outskirts of Melbourne begin to plan for likely impacts arising from
climate change.
The development of the adaptation plan employed a best practice risk
management approach in line with AS/NZS 31000: 2009 and AS 5334: 2013
and took and whole-of-council approach. Undertaking a risk assessment
approach to climate change adaptation planning for a peri-urban local
government area was successful. The approach assisted council to build
capacity in climate change, adaptation and the process of undertaking a
risk assessment and define their area of operation, influence and
responsibility in regards to adaptation actions and the role of other
external stakeholders. Further, it helped them to integrate the risks
and associated adaptation options directly into the existing risk
register system and understand the relativity of climate risks to
non-climate risks that the council faces, such as land use change,
increasing proportions of absentee landholders and an ageing
demographic.

compositions of water samples can be successfully used to interpret
spatial and temporal changes in the microbial communities in water
reservoirs. The proposed methodology consists of the construction of a
modified weighted multivariate mixture model for the PLFA profiles of
the water samples collected in a given monitoring campaign and the
identification of latent PLFA components through a comparison with the
known PLFA profiles of some cultivated or non-cultivated microbial
communities. A 16S rDNA analysis of some of the selected water samples
in the monitoring campaign was performed in order to verify the results
of the PLFA analysis.
The results showed that the proposed methodology can be useful for a
dynamic and sensitive evaluation of changes in the microbial quality of
water before and after flash flooding and can help in taking a decision
regarding further risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

of human activities (site development, drainage changes, construction
activities); and (4) and most importantly, the impacts of extreme
weather (precipitation, temperature, flash flooding, erosion). Baseline
load and resistance parameters for a given karst area or site are
analyzed for normal pre-failure or typical failure limit states. Various
load and critical resistance factors are then applied to determine
possible failure limit states. A simple graph or map of each critical
load or resistance factor with time or location is developed for key
parameters such as sinkhole failure history, precipitation, groundwater
fluctuations-flow, surface runoff, drainage changes, and any relevant
activity by man. The average normal range, upper and lower
damage-failure thresholds are identified along with the upper and lower
extremes that are associated with major failures and disasters. By
overlaying the various load-resistance factors, critical limit states
and sinkhole risk are determined for any given area and combinations of
loading-resistance conditions. The use of the sinkhole limit state risk
assessment methodology is presented for a PA33-Tatamy Road Pennsylvania
sinkhole case study.

T1  - Chronological trends in maximum and minimum water flows of the Teesta River, Bangladesh, and its implications

PD  - 
AB  - Bangladesh shares a common border with India in the west, north and east
and with Myanmar in the southeast. These borders cut across 57 rivers
that discharge through Bangladesh into the Bay of Bengal in the south.
The upstream courses of these rivers traverse India, China, Nepal and
Bhutan. Transboundary flows are the important sources of water resources
in Bangladesh. Among the 57 transboundary rivers, the Teesta is the
fourth major river in Bangladesh after the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and
the Meghna and Bangladesh occupies about 2071 km(2). The Teesta River
floodplain in Bangladesh accounts for 14% of the total cropped area and
9.15 million people of the country. The objective of this study was to
investigate trends in both maximum and minimum water flow at Kaunia and
Dalia stations for the Teesta River and the coping strategies developed
by the communities to adjust with uncertain flood situations. The flow
characteristics of the Teesta were analysed by calculating monthly
maximum and minimum water levels and discharges from 1985 to 2006.
Discharge of the Teesta over the last 22 years has been decreasing.
Extreme low-flow conditions were likely to occur more frequently after
the implementation of the Gozoldoba Barrage by India. However, a very
sharp decrease in peak flows was also observed albeit unexpected high
discharge in 1988, 1989, 1991, 1997, 1999 and 2004 with some in between
April and October. Onrush of water causes frequent flash floods, whereas
decreasing flow leaves the areas dependent on the Teesta vulnerable to
droughts. Both these extreme situations had a negative impact on the
lives and livelihoods of people dependent on the Teesta. Over the years,
people have developed several risk mitigation strategies to adjust with
both natural and anthropogenic flood situations. This article proposed
the concept of `MAXIN (maximum and minimum) flows' for river water
justice for riparian land.

AB  - Health is one the most vital aspects that is of greater concern to most
of the human beings at present days. To keep people healthier they
intake a lot of fruits which contains more amount of nutrition and helps
them to remain fit. Health benefits are provided with the intake of
fruits and people who regularly intake fruits are expected to have
minimized risk of chronic diseases. The Nutrients provided by the fruits
are vital for proper maintenance of the body. But those fruits nowadays
are ripened through some artificial means like usage of chemicals like
calcium carbide as ripening agent which might even cause cancer. An
important news that flashes during the mango seasons in television is
that the fruit markets contain artificially ripened fruits which is
extremely hazardous to health. Artificial ripening of mangoes using
calcium carbide was the important fact that was being displayed in the
news. Despite repeated warnings, raids and seizures, chemically ripened
fruits are flooding the market. According to health officials, the
consumption of mangoes ripened using calcium carbide leads to various
harmful effects like vomiting, diarrhoea, ulcers of throat and abdomen,
general weakness, and sometimes damage of eye permanently and breathing
shortness. To avoid such ill effects the consumers have to be careful in
buying the mangoes, find out the artificially ripened mangoes. Finding
out the artificially ripened fruits is difficult with human eye
observation. To aid the detection we have developed a device which uses
image processing to find the artificially ripened mangoes. The proposed
device gets an input image of mango under test and compares the features
(histogram values) with a naturally ripened one and detects fruits which
are ripened artificially. This method makes usage of the Smartphone
which runs android application that is installed in it and the image
processing is executed to detect the artificially ripened fruits. The
proposed system has an efficiency of 91% in the identification of the
fruits ripened artificially.

T1  - Nature-Based Solutions and Buildings - The Power of Surfaces to Help Cities Adapt to Climate Change and to Deliver Biodiversity
A1  - Fritz, Marco

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - By 2020, according to United Nations and European Union reports, 75% of
Europe's population will be living in cities - that's around 365 million
citizens. The majority of our cities are hot, dry, polluted and
impermeable and increasingly densely populated. The pressure for new
development means hard, impermeable surfaces are replacing urban green
space and natural habitats. At the same time, climate change is bringing
more frequent and extreme weather events such as summer storms, flash
flooding and heatwaves.
New developments must be resilient. But we also need to retrofit our
existing building stock - to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
This challenge is also a chance - to green cities and to create habitats
for species which in turn provide us with the ecosystem services and
benefits cities will rely on for health, well-being and prosperity
through the twenty first century. When designed in an integrative and
inclusive way, nature- based solutions such as green roofs, green walls,
rain gardens, street trees and other urban green infrastructure generate
a wide range of benefits.
As well as providing habitats for species, urban greening helps to keep
cities cool during summer heat waves, reducing the Urban Heat Island
Effect, to manage surface water flooding due to heavy rains and to
improve air quality. Green infrastructure also offers an attractive
economic Return On Investment (ROI) and a range of other benefits to
society, such as connection with nature, and mental and physical health.
High quality green infrastructure can also reduce noise pollution, a
major cause of stress for city dwellers. Greening a building can help
cut heating and cooling costs too, saving energy and other resources.
Green cities give better quality of life, meaning healthier, happier
citizens, higher productivity at work and a reduction in absence from
work due to illness.
This paper focuses on the microclimate benefits of integrating high
quality green infrastructure as part of adapting cities to climate
change. It estimates market potential and related factors such as energy
use, evapotranspiration and water management. It explains through best
practise examples how green roofs and green walls designed for nature
can contribute to urban biodiversity networks. And it shows how twenty
first century nature-based cities can be natural, healthy and resilient.

PD  - 
AB  - Portland Cement Pervious Concrete (PCPC) can reduce the risk of flash
flood by letting the storm runoff to sip through the voids available in
the PCPC hence infiltrate into the soil. This unique ability of pervious
concrete offers advantages to the environment, public agencies, and
building owners by controlling rainwater on site and addressing storm
water runoff issues. Thus, this study was conducted to substantiate the
usage of inorganic, cheap and reusable material namely Recycled or
reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and Fine Crumb Rubber (FCR) in pervious
concrete. The primary objective of this study is to compare the
compressive strength, density and the surface infiltration rate of
pervious concrete containing waste tire rubber with pervious concrete
that is made up by using natural aggregate without any enhancement.
Standard pervious concrete will consist of natural coarse aggregates and
cement. In this study, RAP will be replacing the natural coarse
aggregates, the same size with the previous research. The modified
pervious concrete will also be mixed with a certain percentage of FCR,
replacing certain percentage of the coarse aggregate. The results of
this study indicate that using recycled material could achieve similar
performance as using natural aggregate, hence may reduce the
construction cost.

AB  - The flash flood occurring due to glacier lake outbursts (GLOFs) are
usually catastrophic to the human lives and infrastructure in the
downstream areas. It is therefore, important to map and frequently
monitor glacier lakes of Himalaya not only to know the impact of climate
change on glacier lakes but also to mitigate hazards that may cause loss
to the society. In the present study, we have generated a glacier lake
inventory of Himachal Pradesh using high resolution Resourcesat 2 LISS
IV satellite images. A total of 958 glacier lakes (size > 500 m(2)) of
Himachal Pradesh (covering an area of 9.6 +/- 0.3 km(2)) have been
mapped using high resolution images. Out of these, 345 were classified
as moraine-dammed lakes having a total area of 5.1 +/- 0.2 km(2) (53.1
% of the total glacier lake area). Altitude wise distribution of
glacier lakes in Himachal Pradesh range from 3001 m a.s.l. to 5614 m
a.s.l. The maximum glacier lakes area is seen in Chandra basin (2.7 +/-
0.09 km(2)). Sissu, an artificial lake (area, 1900 +/- 66 m(2)) is
situated at the minimum elevation (similar to 3100 in) in the Chandra
basin. A supra-glacial lake in the Spiti basin is located at the maximum
mean elevation of the study area (5614 m). The largest lake in the
Himachal Pradesh has been classified as other moraine-dammed lake (1.0
+/- 0.03km(2)) is sited at frontal of Samundra Tapu Glacier in the
Chandra basin. The maximum number of glacier lakes are seen in the Miyar
basin (156 counts), whereas minimum lakes are located in the Siul basin
(06). The present study will provide a reference database to quantify
impact of climate change on glaciers and glacial lakes in the region and
will allow identification of potential ly dangerous lakes in the state i
n conjunction with detailed ground investigations.

AB  - The snowfall limit has important implications for different hazardous
processes associated with prolonged or heavy precipitation such as flash
floods, rain-on-snow events and freezing precipitation. To increase
preparedness and to reduce risk in such situations, early warning
systems are frequently used to monitor and predict precipitation events
at different temporal and spatial scales. However, in alpine and
pre-alpine valleys, the estimation of the snowfall limit remains rather
challenging. In this study, we characterize uncertainties related to
snowfall limit for different lead times based on local measurements of a
vertically pointing micro rain radar (MRR) and a disdrometer in the Zulg
valley, Switzerland. Regarding the monitoring, we show that the
interpolation of surface temperatures tends to overestimate the altitude
of the snowfall limit and can thus lead to highly uncertain estimates of
liquid precipitation in the catchment. This bias is much smaller in the
Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis (INCA) system,
which integrates surface station and remotely sensed data as well as
outputs of a numerical weather prediction model. To reduce systematic
error, we perform a bias correction based on local MRR measurements and
thereby demonstrate the added value of such measurements for the
estimation of liquid precipitation in the catchment. Regarding the
nowcasting, we show that the INCA system provides good estimates up to 6
h ahead and is thus considered promising for operational hydrological
applications. Finally, we explore the medium-range forecasting of
precipitation type, especially with respect to rain-on-snow events. We
show for a selected case study that the probability for a certain
precipitation type in an ensemble-based forecast is more persistent than
the respective type in the high-resolution forecast (HRES) of the
European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Integrated
Forecasting System (ECMWF IFS). In this case study, the ensemble-based
forecast could be used to anticipate such an event up up 7-8 days ahead,
whereas the use of the HRES is limited to a lead time of 4-5 days. For
the different lead times investigated, we point out possibilities of
considering uncertainties in snowfall limit and precipitation type
estimates so as to increase preparedness to risk situations.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - As one of the 195 member countries of the United Nations, Germany signed
the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR).
Among other targets, the SFDRR aims at reducing direct economic losses
caused by natural hazards by 2030. The United Nations Office for
Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) has hence proposed a methodology for
estimating direct economic losses per event and country, based on
experiences from developing countries. Since its usability in
industrialized countries is unknown, this study presents the first
implementation and validation of this approach in Germany. The
methodology was tested for the three costliest natural hazard types in
Germany, i.e. floods, wind and hail storms, considering 12 case studies
between 1984 and 2016. Although the event-specific input data
requirements are restricted to the number of damaged or destroyed units
per sector, incomplete event documentations did not allow a full
validation of all sectors necessary to describe the total direct
economic loss. New modules (cars, forestry, paved roads, housing
contents and overall costs of urban infrastructure) were developed to
better adapt this methodology to German conditions. Whereas the original
UNISDR methodology both over-and underestimates the losses of the tested
events by a wide margin, the adapted methodology is able to calculate
losses accounting well for all event types except for flash floods.
Hence, this approach serves as a good starting point for macro-scale
loss estimations. By implementing this approach into damage and event
documentation and reporting standards, a consistent monitoring of the
SFDRR could be achieved.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Farmers in flood-based irrigation systems face great uncertainties with
respect to water supply. Using the Source-Pathways-Receptor and
Consequence (SPRC) framework, this paper explores the sources of risks,
propagation pathways, risk perceptions and consequences for the farmers,
water users' associations (WUAs) and water managers in the Gash
Agricultural Scheme in Sudan. The main source of risk is the extreme
variability of rainfall, causing unpredictable flows regarding volume,
timing and duration. The farmers, WUAs and system managers perceive the
risks from floods differently. The farmers are primarily concerned by
low floods, while the WUAs are more disturbed by untimely floods. The
system managers are most troubled by high and potentially destructive
floods. The poor state of the infrastructure, lack of proper maintenance
and suboptimal operation aggravate the consequences of unpredictable
flows. Consequently, the result is low and highly variable crop
production. Besides paying attention to infrastructure improvement and
regular operation and maintenance activities, more efforts in
institutional arrangements and policy support could play an important
role in coping with the risks indicated. The SPRC appeared to be a
useful framework for analysing risks at different spatial scales and for
different stakeholders in the spate irrigation system studied. Copyright

AB  - Large wood (LW) can lead to clogging at bridges and thus cause
obstruction, followed by floodplain inundation. Moreover, colliding logs
can cause severe damage to bridges, defense structures, and other
infrastructure elements. The factors influencing spatiotemporal LW
dynamics (LWD) during extreme floods vary remarkably across river basins
and flood scenarios. However, there is a lack of methods to estimate the
amount of LW in rivers during extreme floods. Modelling approaches allow
for a reliable assessment of LW dynamics during extreme flood events by
determining LW recruitment, transport, and deposition patterns. Here, we
present a method for simulating LWD on a river reach scale implemented
in R (LWDsimR). We extended a previously developed LW transport model
with a tree recognition model on the basis of Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) data for LW recruitment simulation. In addition, we
coupled the LWD simulation model with the hydrodynamic simulation model
Basic Simulation Environment for Computation of Environmental Flow and
Natural Hazard Simulation (BASEMENT-ETH) by adapting the existing LW
transport model to be used on irregular meshes. The model has been
applied in the Aare River basin (Switzerland) to quantify mobilized LW
volumes and the associated flow paths in a probable maximum flood
scenario.

PD  - 
AB  - This systematic review summarises the findings of research focused on
the risks associated with driving into floodwater. The review aims to
compare and document the magnitude of the problem internationally;
identifying the risk factors; exploring the application of theories and
presence of theoretical models to explain people's risky behaviour; and
documenting the intervention strategies utilised or proposed. Literature
were searched from a number of databases (e.g. PsycInfo, ScienceDirect,
Informit) for publication dates to 31 August 2017, then assessed based
on their titles, abstracts and full texts and finally 24 articles were
selected. This review compares flood fatality data from four countries
(Australia, United States, Greece, and Sweden), groups identified risk
factors from these selected studies into seven categories, and proposes
a holistic integrated intervention model. The results of the review
indicate that studies were predominantly conducted in Australia (10
studies) and USA (7 studies). People's decisions to drive into, or turn
back from, floodwater are identified as a consequence of both their risk
perception and the combined impact of all other factors (e.g.
individual, social, environmental etc.) that interdependently contribute
to shape decision-making, The theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was the
only theory that has been utilised within the literature to understand
drivers' willingness to take risks. Improving people's decision-making
through educational initiatives, advanced structural mechanisms,
regulating existing edicts, and regularly evaluating the effectiveness
of current strategies are identified as the best approaches to
addressing the challenges in this area. Findings suggest that future
studies require data and analysis from a larger range of countries, more
comparative analyses within and between countries, an exploration of the
relationship between risk factors and their relative level of influence
and a greater application of behavioural and decision making theories.

PD  - 
AB  - Mass urbanisation presents one of the most urgent challenges of the 21st
century. The development of cities and the related increasing ground
sealing are asking even more for the restoration of urban rivers,
especially in the face of climate change and its consequences. This
paper aims to demonstrate nature-inspired solutions in a recovery of a
Southern European river that was canalised and transformed in culvert
pipes. The river restoration project naturally tells the history of the
city, creates a sense for the place, as well as unifying blue-green
infrastructure in a symbolic way by offering areas for recreation. To
improve well-being and city resilience in the long term, a regenerative
sustainability approach based on biophilic design patterns was proposed.
Such actions will provide greater health, social cohesion, and
well-being for residents and simultaneously reduce the risks of climate
change, such as heat island effect and flash floods, presenting the
benefits of the transition to a regenerative economy and holistic
thinking.

PD  - 
AB  - Worldwide, flood is the number one cause of losses from natural events.
The insurance of the flood risk has attracted more and more attention in
recent years, not only in the fields of science and politics but also
within the insurance industry itself. Even if the list of great natural
disasters is headed by storms and despite the relatively low density of
insurance against flooding the large number of local flood events
constitutes a major factor for the insurance industry. Flooding comes in
very different ways, ranging from storm surges to flash floods and from
sometimes country-wide river floods to glacial lake outburst and dam
break floods. These different types are important when insurance
concepts are regarded, for which adverse selection plays an important
role.
Various concepts for the difficult field of flood insurance have been
investigated and discussed in different countries. In Germany, the
insurance industry, in a combined effort, has launched a project to
identify zones of similar risk resulting from river floods for the whole
country. The identification of possible clients and the calculation of
premiums are two uses of the developed model as well as the assessment
of probable maximum losses. Only river floods are considered in the
model, flash floods and storm surges are excluded; flood control
measures are not taken into account either.

AB  - In many semi-arid regions large irrigation schemes have been developed
on fertile plains without provision of drainage networks. The reasons
are usually due to a lack of good quality waters and/or high investment
costs. Under these environments, characterized by an alternation of wet
and dry seasons, adoption of restrictive irrigation practices can help
control or, at least, slow down the salinization process of the
irrigated lands. Rainfall must have a major role in water supply to the
crop and to wash salts below the root zone. Experimental findings show
that olive yields planted on loamy sands under 200 mm rainfall are the
same (4.3-4.5 T/ha), when irrigation amounts vary between
450-950mm/year. Orange production remains almost unchanged when supply
with saline waters increases from 300 to 650 mm/year under 450mm
rainfall regime. Sandy soil seems to reach a state of equilibrium after
few years of irrigation with saline waters. With loamy soils
precipitation higher than 500 mm. seems to be effective in salt
leaching. When rainfall is important, strategies based on restrictive
supply could be used to control salinity in the dry regions. Practices
based on supplemental irrigation (SI) and restricted deficit irrigation
(RDI) have the potential to reduce the amount of total salts added to
the soil while improving crop productivity. An alternative to large
scale irrigation projects, where salinization risks are high, is the
construction of small reservoirs to collect runoff waters and the
development of small irrigation schemes on sloping areas where
occasional flash floods could be diverted to wash out the little amounts
of accumulated salts.

A1  - Rawat, Pradeep K
Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - The Lesser Himalaya region is a densely populate d, nonglacial tract of
the Himalaya. About 95 percent of the regional population depends on
agriculture and forest resources but both have been declining rapidly in
recent decades due to climate change and hydrological hazards. The main
objective of this study was to assess the integrated impacts of climate
change and hydrological hazards on monsoon crop patterns in the Lesser
Himalaya through a geographic information system (GIS) database
management system (DMS). The DMS comprises four GIS modules: climate
informatics, land use informatics, hydro-informatics, and
agro-informatics. The Dabka watershed in India's Uttara-khand State is
part of the Kosi Basin in the Lesser Himalaya in District Nainital and
was chosen as a case study. The climate of the study area, depending on
elevation, falls into three climatic zones: subtropical, temperate, and
moist temperate, which are favorable for mixed forest, pine forest, and
oak forest respectively. The results of the climate-informatics analysis
suggest that in recent decades all these climatic zones have shifted
towards higher altitudes and the areas of oak and pine forests have
decreased. Forest degradation has accelerated hydrological hazards (high
runoff, flash floods, river-line floods, soil erosion, and landslides)
in monsoon periods, which affected about 22 percent of the cultivated
land annually in 2005-2010. Monsoon crop yields decreased by an annual
average of 1.40 percent between 1985 and 2010 while the population of
the study area increased by an average of 2 percent each year in the
same period. The negative correlation between annual crop yields and
population growth has led to increased food security risks.

AB  - In the development of an area, consideration of the risk of natural
disasters was imperative priority. Regional development should adapt to
the risks of natural disasters that owned the region. One of the
provinces in Indonesia that susceptible to multi risk hazard is Bengkulu
Province. It located in the west of the Bukit Barisan Mountains. This
region has the potential for landslides, floods, flash floods,
earthquakes, earthquakes and tsunamis, tidal waves, hurricane, and land
fire. In development sector, inequality occurred in Bengkulu province,
especially large concentration of population distribution in the city of
Bengkulu. Moreover, Bengkulu Province is the province with the highest
poverty composition in order to 9 of 33 provinces in Indonesia This
paper discusses the development direction of the region in the Bengkulu
Province, which is associated with the potential for disaster. The
method used in this study is the scaling. The group indicator used are
population, employment, social, infrastructure, economy, and between the
indicator variables such as the Human Development Index. Each group of
indicators has indicators, which will be positive or negative value.
Positive means, if the indicator high then the development will high and
otherwise for the negative value. All indicators then scaled, it show
the regional development. To know the distribution rate of the regional
development at different levels of disaster susceptibility used cross
tabulation analysis techniques. The tabulated results will show
matrixes. It can be use as a preparation strategy for regional
development in the Bengkulu province. Based on the results of these
calculations known that. Most areas of the regency or city in the
Bengkulu Province have low and medium level of regional development. Of
the ten regencies, eight counties have high levels of susceptibility to
disasters and two counties have medium level susceptibility to disaster.
Kaur, Kepahiang and Lebong should receive priority in development
especially related to disaster management because have low level of
development and have high susceptibility to disaster. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB  - Climate and weather variability induces considerable switch in
storm-erosivity, which is the power of rainfall involved in many
damaging hydro-meteorological events worldwide. The present paper
proposes advances in our understanding of the hydroclimatological
processes and their associated modelling requirements that can be useful
in both climate simulation and extremes reconstruction. The novel model
CREM (Complexity-reduced Storm Erosivity Model) was developed to test a
parsimonious approach in order to perform historical reconstructions of
annual rainfall-runoff erosivity when high-resolution precipitation
records (e. g., hourly or sub-hourly) are missing. The test-area is
located in the Western Swiss Plateau (around Bern), where erosive
rainstorm can occur with different modes as seasonal meteorological
patterns evolve. The CREM incorporates monthly precipitation and the
daily maximum rainfall in a year for estimating storm erosivity
compatible with the climatic factor of the RUSLE. Despite its
simplicity, the CREM has estimated the storm erosivity with sufficient
accuracy, explaining about 90 % of the interannual variability for the
validation period (1989-2010). This model calibration offered the
possibility of using the model to reconstruct the annual erosivity for
the study-area since 1864. Analysis of the reconstructed time series
identified two breakpoints (end of nineteenth century, 1970s) that could
be related to distinct climate periods. It also indicated a moderate
temporal dependence structure. In general, the CREM model produced
reliable results and is thus proposed as a useful tool for climatic
reconstructions.

PD  - 
AB  - This study aims to develop a real-time heat illness alert system (HIAS)
for monitoring outdoor working environment related to heat. Using
monthly Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis and hourly weather data from Thai
Meteorological Department (TMD), the system applies Steadman Method to
calculate heat index (HI) and issues warning when the predefined
conditions are met. The results show that Thailand's daily temperature
distribution is influenced by solar declination. Seasonal effects such
as moist air in wet season will also drive up the apparent temperature.
The developed HIAS system uses hourly weather data from TMD's weather
stations in proximity of 5 air force bases. System tests showed that the
system can calculate heat index and provide real-time heat illness risk
warning by showing an appropriate color on warning display. The
prototype systems can be effectively used to provide a safer working
environment for military personnel. While this study focuses on the risk
from heat exposure, it also provides a guideline for development of
other types of warning systems such as those for heavy precipitation,
flash flood, and water overflow.

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Desertification is a serious global problem and more acute in the case
of Pakistan. In Pakistan almost 3/4th of the land is either already
affected or likely to be affected by it. Desertification process has
been active since historical times in areas now-a-days constituting
Pakistan. Amongst the factors affecting desertification in Pakistan, the
fundamental factor is population pressure. Other major immediate
physical cause of ecological degradation includes: excessive felling of
trees, inadequate reforestation activities, inappropriate cultivation
practices in hilly and rain fed farming area, uncontrolled and excessive
livestock grazing in forest and rangeland. Inadequate efforts with
regard to watershed protection and management in the catchments areas of
reservoirs lead to sever soil erosion. Irrational irrigation practices
also enhance land degradation. As a result of such activities vegetation
cover is destroyed, and it also leads to prevent regeneration of grasses
and trees etc.
The Desertification occur in both rain fed as well as irrigated lands.
Pakistan is mainly a dryland country, where 80 % of its land is arid
and semi-arid. Two-third of its human population depends on these
drylands to support their livelihood. Like many other developing
countries, Pakistan is severely affected by land degradation and
desertification. Unsustainable land management practices are causing
enormous environmental problems, including soil erosion, loss of soil
fertility, flash floods, sedimentation of canals and water courses,
deforestation and associated loss of carbon sequestration capacity and
biodiversity. In recent years, number of Federal and provincial agencies
are engaged to combat desertification. However, the efforts made by the
originations and departments along with non-government organizations
hardly fill the gap between its increasing intensity and disaster risk
reduction measures to control desertification.

PD  - 
AB  - In the history, numerous cities were affected by natural and man-made
disasters. After fall of disasters, heavy amount of budget have been
spent on the response and recovery, to reinstate the disruption of urban
economic activities. The investment on urban risk reduction is much more
effective than picking up the pieces afterwards. It is cities, which
empower the societies and hub of industrial and commercial services.
Urban resilience is largely a function of resilience and resourceful
citizens. The strong and committed involvement of citizen at the
grassroots level may yield a resilient city. There are many factors that
affect urban resilience and no two cities are alike in their inherent
capacity. Therefore, building cities more resilient to both external and
internal negative factors may lead to more productive economic returns.
In Pakistan, 36 % of the total population is living in urban areas, out
of which one-fifth is resided in Karachi alone and two-third in both
Karachi and Lahore. Out of total urban centres, eight have more than one
million population and 68 have over 100,000 inhabitants. In Pakistan,
large cities are at risk to various hazards and they have been
threatened seriously, while others are at the verge. The mega cities
including Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Peshawar have
already come a across serious episodes of urban flooding during the past
one decade. In addition to this, heavy downpour, heat waves, drought,
storm surges, flash flooding are some of the key effects of climate
change exacerbations on urban areas. Cities are as vulnerable as they
are powerful that's why the urban authorities should take concrete steps
for preparedness and emergency management plans as an urban risk
reduction strategy in a systematic way and enable a city to tolerate a
disaster with minimal loss of life and resultant damages. This chapter
stimulate new arena for thinking and devising innovative approaches for
sustainable urban development in the country.

PD  - 
AB  - Disasters such as flash flooding, mass shootings, and train and airplane
accidents involving large numbers of victims produce significant
opportunity for research in the biosciences. This opportunity exists in
the extreme tails of life events, however, during which decisions about
life and death, valuing and foregoing, speed and patience, trust and
distrust, are tested simultaneously and abundantly. The press and
urgency of these scenarios may also challenge the ability of researchers
to comprehensively deliver information about the purposes of a study,
risks, benefits, and alternatives. Under these circumstances, we argue
that acquiring consent for the immediate use of data that are not time
sensitive represents a gap in the protection of human study
participants. In response, we offer a two-tiered model of consent that
allows for data collected in real-time to be held in escrow until the
acute post-disaster window has closed. Such a model not only respects
the fundamental tenet of consent in research, but also enables such
research to take place in an ethically defensible manner.

AB  - The hydro-climate information is absolutely important for the management
of water and environmental resources. However, in many cases,
information for extreme hydro-climate variables are neglected. It is
acknowledged that the climate change scenarios will affect the
variability of extreme hydro-climate variables. In this study, several
robust statistical tests were applied to identify the variability of
several hydro-climate parameters in the northeastern region of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE). The variables are annual maximum daily mean,
maximum and minimum temperature; annual maximum daily rainfall; annual
maximum mean humidity, wind speed, sea level pressure and solar
radiation. Historical trends and step changes were identified. Five
climate stations located in Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Fujairah and Ras
Al Khaima were considered. Statistically significant increasing trends
were observed in extreme temperature and rainfall parameters in all
locations except the Al Ain region. The UAE is located in the arid
climate region with an average annual rainfall of less than 100 mm.
Increase of extreme rainfall might increase the risk of flash floods in
the mountainous eastern region. Possible impacts of changes of extreme
temperature and rainfall in the region are delineated in the study. (C)

AB  - In this study, we present a method for identifying sources of water
pollution and their relative contributions in pollution disasters. The
method uses a combination of principal component analysis and factor
analysis. We carried out a case study in three rural villages close to
Beijing after torrential rain on July 21, 2012. Nine water samples were
analyzed for eight parameters, namely turbidity, total hardness, total
dissolved solids, sulfates, chlorides, nitrates, total bacterial count,
and total coliform groups. All of the samples showed different degrees
of pollution, and most were unsuitable for drinking water as
concentrations of various parameters exceeded recommended thresholds.
Principal component analysis and factor analysis showed that two
factors, the degree of mineralization and agricultural runoff, and flood
entrainment, explained 82.50% of the total variance. The case study
demonstrates that this method is useful for evaluating and interpreting
large, complex water-quality data sets.

AB  - The number of natural disasters is growing. A considerable number of
them derives directly from climate changes and generates a deep impact
on cultural heritages. As a result, the need for solutions able to cope
with uncertain weather conditions and increased natural disasters is
getting urgent. STORM is a European Research and Innovation Action
co-funded in the H2020 framework that is aimed at creating intelligent
tools which will gather data from libraries, sensors and crowd-sensing
techniques in order to enable cultural heritage stakeholders (e.g., the
organisations which have to manage the sites) to implement the most
appropriate actions in the prevention, response and recovery phases of
emergencies which could impact on cultural heritages. More specifically,
the project aims at addressing those risks deriving from climate change,
which in the near future is going to worsen most of the present hazards,
as flash floods, heat waves and forest fires. As such, the approach
adopted by the project is particularly fit for the purpose of being
integrated with smart city systems which are increasingly growing in
number and variety. Even if safety issues are not considered central in
the overall concept of smart city, it's plain that the huge quantity of
data that can be gathered and processed in any future STORM-like urban
cultural heritage compound should feed into the available smart city
systems. On the other way round, the mass of data produced or processed
by smart city systems have the potential to impact dramatically on
emergency management and prevention activities to be implemented by
cultural heritage stakeholders. The paper will illustrate the approach
that the STORM project is adopting to mitigate the impact of climate
changes on cultural heritages and the mutual benefits which could derive
from an integration of the STORM outcomes with smart cities systems
through the use of standard emergency data exchange protocols and an
integrated framework aimed at improving existing processes related to
the three identified areas: Prevention, Response and Policy.

AB  - The Petra Archaeological Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985,
characterized by a spectacular geo-archaeological landscape, is also a
fragile site facing a wide diversity of natural phenomena (landslides,
flash floods, earthquakes) that pose a major threat to the heritage as
well as to the visitors. The UNESCO Office in Amman, in partnership with
the Department of Antiquities of Jordan and the Petra Archaeological
Park has engaged in a long term strategy aimed at the prevention and
mitigation of natural hazards at the site. Specific attention has been
devoted to the case of the Petra Siq, a 1.2 km naturally formed gorge in
the sandstone mountains serving as the only tourist entrance to the
site, which is particularly at risk due to its narrow pathway, limited
access points and recent active slope processes. Drawing on this
approach, the UNESCO ``Siq Stability{''} project has been developed to
design a strategy towards prevention and mitigation of instability
phenomena at the Siq of Petra. After an initial phase devoted to the
reconstruction of geomorphological dynamics and monitoring of active
slope processes, the current phase of the project focuses on the
implementation of landslide risk mitigation measures, the capacity
development of the national authorities and the development and
implementation of an awareness strategy on natural hazards. Main focus
has been placed on project activities undertaken, results achieved and
suggestions for steps ahead, aiming to present a useful case study on
the management of natural hazards applied to heritage sites leading to
the conservation of a unique World Heritage property.

PD  - 
AB  - The nature of the threats carried by Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) attack requires effective detection as well as efficient response
methods. However, feature-based schemes are unsuitable for real-time
detection due to their complicated calculations and most of the
statistical-based schemes do not distinguish DDoS attacks from
legitimate changes. Besides, it is impossible to set a threshold that
takes into account both false positives and false negatives. A hard
threshold reduces the risk of false negatives but significantly
increases the rate of false positives. In contrast, a soft threshold can
easily be exploited by attackers to insert a malicious traffic that
respects the conduct of good flow. To avoid these defects, we suggest a
two-stage approach based on the detection of breaks in the distribution
of connections size. A connection is defined as the aggregate traffic
between two IP addresses, where one address belongs to the police
address set, and the other is a foreign address. The connection size is
measured in number of packets. To achieve our goal, we employ Total
Variation Distance (TVD) to measure horizontal and vertical similarity
among flows. We investigate a class of intelligent denial of service
attacks which, unlike high-rate attacks, are difficult for other's
schemes to detect. The experimental results indicate that our scheme can
detect DDoS flooding attacks accurately. The effectiveness of our
approach, even against intelligent attacks, is around 90%. (C) 2012

AB  - Land-use change is one of the major factors that alter local and
regional hydrology. For areas experiencing fast expansion of urban and
agriculture areas, land-use changes often adversely affect stream flow
and water resources at the local and watershed scale. The Sekong, Sesan,
and Srepok (3S) Sub-basins are a part of the Lower Mekong River Basin
and include land in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos),
and Viet Nam. The region is experiencing a dynamic land-use transition
because of rapid changes in its economy, society, and environment. Major
land-use changes include deforestation of native rain forest, expansion
of agricultural and urban areas, and expansion of commercial plantation
such as rubber trees. These land-use alterations have affected local and
regional hydrologic processes, resulting in stream flow shortages during
the dry season and flash flooding due to deforestation. In this
research, deforestation in the 3S Sub-basins over the period 1993-1997
was analyzed using multi-logistic regression. The regression analysis
indicated that density of agricultural cells within a 5-km radius from
each forest cell and slope strongly affected the deforestation process.
A land-use forecast model to simulate deforestation and urbanization
sites was developed in GIS based on local land-use change trends. The
model was applied to 2003 land use to forecast 2033 land use and future
water demand, which was further compared with present stream flow
measurements during the dry season at various places in the region. The
entire approach from the land-use forecast to its impact assessment on
stream flow could help local stakeholders understand watershed-wide
future water resources risks and develop future water resources plans.
With the 3S Sub-basins being used as a case study area, this article
presents a land-use forecast tool; simulated 2033 land-use and water
demand; and the estimation of the impact of the forecasted future water
demand on the local stream flow.

freshwater pollution, and seismic disturbance risks. Natural processes
are significantly affected by human interference as well as by climate
change and tectonic developments over the long term. To get a deep
understanding of processes and their interactions, innovative scientific
approaches that integrate disciplinary research and education are
required. The research project DESERVE (Helmholtz Virtual Institute Dead
Sea Research Venue) addresses these challenges in an interdisciplinary
approach that includes geophysics, hydrology, and meteorology. The
project is implemented by a consortium of scientific institutions in
neighboring countries of the Dead Sea (Israel, Jordan, Palestine
Territories) and participating German Helmholtz Centres (KIT, GFZ, UFZ).
A new monitoring network of meteorological, hydrological, and
seismic/geodynamic stations has been established, and extensive field
research and numerical simulations have been undertaken. For the first
time, innovative measurement and modeling techniques have been applied
to the extreme conditions of the Dead Sea and its surroundings. The
preliminary results show the potential of these methods. First time ever
performed eddy covariance measurements give insight into the governing
factors of Dead Sea evaporation. High-resolution bathymetric
investigations reveal a strong correlation between submarine springs and
neo-tectonic patterns. Based on detailed studies of stratigraphy and
borehole information, the extension of the subsurface drainage basin of
the Dead Sea is now reliably estimated. Originality has been achieved in
monitoring flash floods in an arid basin at its outlet and
simultaneously in tributaries, supplemented by spatio-temporal rainfall
data. Low-altitude, high resolution photogrammetry, allied to satellite
image analysis and to geophysical surveys (e.g. shear-wave reflections)
has enabled a more detailed characterization of sinkhole morphology and
temporal development and the possible subsurface controls thereon. All
the above listed efforts and scientific results take place with the
interdisciplinary education of young scientists. They are invited to
attend joint thematic workshops and winter schools as well as to
participate in field experiments. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Inundation zones of rivers are risky environments for terrestrial
animals because of the regular or irregular occurrence of floods.
Although animals in these zones have evolved several strategies to
survive floods, behavioural anti-flooding strategies have seldom been
studied but could play an important role in their life history
strategies. We previously reported that the groundhopper Tetrix
tenuicornis moves to dense vegetation in response to low atmospheric
pressure (which may signal rain and flooding) but prefers mossy
microhabitats and bare ground under high atmospheric pressure. In the
current study, we found that the ability of the semi-aquatic
groundhoppers T. tenuicornis and Tetrix subulata to withstand direct
water flow was greater in patches of dense vegetation than in patches of
moss or on bare ground. Even a relatively low water velocity led to
water transport (presumably passive) of both species, perhaps because
they lack arolia or other adhesive devices on their tarsi. This
morphological limitation precludes vertical migration on vegetation,
which is a common anti-flooding strategy in insects. Our results suggest
that, by moving to dense vegetation in response to drops in atmospheric
pressure, groundhoppers may reduce their risk of being washed away by
floods.

PD  - 
AB  - This work aims at investigating and quantifying the Urban Transport
System (UTS) resilience enhancement enabled by the adoption of emerging
technology such as Internet of Everything (IoE) and the new trend of the
Connected Community (CC). A conceptual extension of Functional Resonance
Analysis Method (FRAM) and its formalization have been proposed and used
to model UTS complexity. The scope is to identify the system functions
and their interdependencies with a particular focus on those that have a
relation and impact on people and communities. Network analysis
techniques have been applied to the FRAM model to identify and estimate
the most critical community-related functions. The notion of Variability
Rate (VR) has been defined as the amount of output variability generated
by an upstream function that can be tolerated/absorbed by a downstream
function, without significantly increasing of its subsequent output
variability. A fuzzy-based quantification of the VR based on expert
judgment has been developed when quantitative data are not available.
Our approach has been applied to a critical scenario as flash flooding
considering two cases: when UTS has CC and IoE implemented or not.
However, the method can be applied in different scenarios and critical
infrastructures. The results show a remarkable VR enhancement if CC and
IoE are deployed.

T1  - The Behavior of Squall Lines in Horizontally Heterogeneous Coastal Environments
A1  - Lombardo, Kelly
A1  - Kading, Tristan
Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Inland squall lines respond to the stable marine atmospheric boundary
layer (MABL) as they move toward a coastline and offshore. As a storm's
cold pool collides with the marine layer, characteristics of both
determine the resulting convective forcing mechanism over the stable
layer and storm characteristics. Idealized numerical experiments
exploring a parameter space of MABL characteristics show that the
postcollision forcing mechanism is determined by the buoyancy of the
cold pool relative to the MABL. When the outflow is less buoyant, storms
are forced by a cold pool within the marine environment. When the
buoyancies are equivalent, a hybrid cold pool-internal gravity wave
develops after the collision. The collision between a cold pool and less
buoyant MABL initiates internal waves along the stable layer, regardless
of MABL depth. These waves are inefficient at lifting air into the
storm, and ascent from the trailing cold pool is needed to support deep
convection. Storm intensity decreases with deeper and less buoyant
MABLs, in part due to the reduction in elevated instability.
Precipitation is enhanced just prior to the collision between a storm
and the deepest marine layers. Storms modify their environment
downstream, leading to the development of a moist adiabatic unstable
layer and a lowering of the level of free convection (LFC) to below the
top of the deepest marine layer. An MABL moving as a sea breeze into the
storm-modified air successfully lifts parcels to the new LFC, generating
convective towers ahead of the squall line. This mechanism may
contribute to increased coastal flash flooding risks during observed
events.

PD  - 
AB  - Operation of reservoirs is a fundamental issue in water resource
management. We herein investigate well-posedness of an optimal control
problem for irrigation water intake from a reservoir in an irrigation
scheme, the water dynamics of which is modeled with stochastic
differential equations. A prototype irrigation scheme is being developed
in an arid region to harvest flash floods as a source of water. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation governing the value function is
analyzed in the framework of viscosity solutions. The uniqueness of the
value function, which is a viscosity solution to the HJB equation, is
demonstrated with a mathematical proof of a comparison theorem. It is
also shown that there exists such a viscosity solution. Then, an
approximate value function is obtained as a numerical solution to the
HJB equation. The optimal control strategy derived from the approximate
value function is summarized in terms of rule curves to be presented to
the operator of the irrigation scheme.

T1  - Stratigraphy, palaeoenvironments and palaeoecology of the Loch Humphrey Burn lagerstatte and other Mississippian palaeobotanical localities of the Kilpatrick Hills, southwest Scotland
A1  - Bateman, Richard M
A1  - Stevens, Liadan G
A1  - Hilton, Jason
Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Background and Aims. The largely Mississippian strata of the Kilpatrick
Hills, located at the western end of the Scottish Midland Valley,
enclose several macrofossil floras that together contain ca 21
organ-species of permineralised plants and ca 44 organ-species of
compressed plants, here estimated to represent 25 whole-plant species
(Glenarbuck = nine, Loch Humphrey Burn Lower = 11, Upper = seven). The
most significant locality is the internationally important volcanigenic
sequence that is reputedly intercalated within the Clyde Plateau Lava
Formation at Loch Humphrey Burn, where ca 30 m of reworked tuffs and
other clastic sediments enclose one of the world's most important
terrestrial lagerstatten of this period. We here explore the
palaeoecology and palaeoenvironments of the locality, and elucidate its
controversial age.
Methods. Repeated re-excavation of key exposures allowed recognition of
five main depositional units, differing in thickness from 4 m to 12 m.
It also permitted detailed sampling for plant macrofossils and
microfossils throughout the succession. Several approaches are
integrated to re-assess the taphonomy and preservation of these
exceptional plant fossils.
Key Results. The deposits are rich in taxonomically diverse miospores
and in toto contain at least six well-developed compression floras,
together with two beds yielding nodules that enclose well-researched
anatomically preserved plants permineralised in calcite. Bulk
geochemistry shows that the upper nodules formed by migration of Ca with
subordinate Mn and Na. Some phylogenetically important plant fossils
recovered in the early 20th century have been traced to their source
horizons. Trends in relative proportions of macrofossil and microfossil
taxa through the sequence are only moderately congruent, perhaps
reflecting the likelihood that microfossils sample the regional rather
than the local flora.
Conclusions. The Loch Humphrey Burn sequence encompasses a wide range of
depositional environments that intercalates high-energy fluvial channels
(possibly developed during flash floods in a seasonally arid
environment) with lower energy flood plains and a brief lacustrine
interval; all yield macrofloras typically dominated by allochthonous
pteridosperms. The uppermost unit represents clastic swamps dominated by
(hypo) autochthonous lycopsids and ferns s.l., and is tentatively
correlated with the entire-reputedly mid-Visean-exposure at nearby
Glenarbuck. Other nearby localities with rooted tree-lycopsids appear to
have immediately pre-dated the onset of regional volcanism. These
interpretations allow revised provenancing and dating of historical
collections of key plant fossils. The late Tournaisian date previously
attributed on palynological evidence to the lowest unit at Loch Humphrey
Burn appears increasingly improbable when our re-appraisal of the
macrofloras and microfloras is placed in the context of (a) statistical
comparison with other permineralised Mississippian assemblages and (b)
recent stratigraphic and geochronologic studies in the region; rather,
we ascribe the entire Kilpatrick Hills sequence to the mid-Visean.
Stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental interpretations of the
Mississippian rocks of the Kilpatrick Hills have especially profound
implications for our understanding of the physical evolution of Scotland
during the Variscan orogeny and formation of Pangea.

AB  - Undescribed carbonate exposures in the Boston Spa area have been studied
in detail in order to give a comprehensive account of the stratigraphy
and facies there of the upper Permian (Lopingian Series) Cadeby
Formation of the Zechstein Group. The Cadeby Formation was deposited
close to the western margin of the Zechstein Basin, in the Yorkshire
sub-basin. All the strata in the study area are of shallow water origin,
and are thought to have close analogues with modern carbonate sediments
in the Arabian/Persian Gulf. The Cadeby Formation comprises the Wetherby
Member overlain by the Sprotbrough Member. The contact between the
members is here placed at the Hampole Discontinuity, which marks a
subaerial erosion surface. The Wetherby Member includes bryozoan patch
reefs and was deposited on a marginal carbonate shelf of the Zechstein
Basin. The Hampole Beds, which are here placed at the base of the
Sprotbrough Member, were deposited during a period of relatively low
basin-wide sea-level. They include features that suggest deposition in
intertidal and supratidal environments. Influxes of fine clays gave rise
to thin mudstones within the Hampole Beds. Particularly aroundWetherby,
there are also several impersistent mudstones in the strata above the
Hampole Beds. These are considered to have been deposited during
regression; the associated dolomites have features typical of supratidal
conditions, such as fenestrae and microbial laminae, indicative of local
temporary emergence. Shallow subtidal dolomites of the Sprotbrough
Member above the Hampole Beds include cross-stratification that
indicates sandwaves. A lens of clastic material near the top of the
formation atWetherby is interpreted as a flash flood deposit, probably
sourced from emergent areas to the west. The upper beds of the
Sprotbrough Member show dedolomitization, brecciation and karstic
weathering, precursors to the deposition of the terrestrial red clays of
the overlying Edlington Formation. Minor post-Permian barite
mineralization is found and its distribution is related to underlying
structural features.

AB  - Rheophytes are plants confined to the beds of swift-running streams and
rivers, growing above flood level but not beyond the normal reach of
flash floods. Leaf morphoanatomy of the rheophyte Raulinoa echinata R.
S. Cowan (Rutaceae) was investigated with a focus on understanding
adaptation to the peculiarities of the rheophytic habitat. R. echinata
leaves are dorsiventral and hypostomatic. The epidermis has a single
layer of cells and the stomata are anomocytic. The guard cells rise
above the level of the other epidermal cells (a hydromorphic
characteristic), but with a conspicuous outer cavity (a xeromorphic
characteristic). Prominent traits related to the rheophytic habitat are
stenophylls and the presence of suberin on the inner periclinal walls of
the epidermal cells. Leaf area varies with sun exposure while stomatal
density varies with river flow. In R. echinata, mesophyll tissue
thickness varies with light intensity and river flow. Secretory cavities
and idioblasts with calcium phosphate crystals occur in the mesophyll.
The data revealed leaf-structure plasticity in relation to the singular
conditions of the rheophytic environment as well as to shade or
sunlight.

Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - The degradation of the habitat, together with the overexploitation of
natural resources, the invasion by alien species as well as pollution,
represent the major problems jeopardizing coastal regions. Human
activities are the main cause of marine pollution, including recurrent
spills of toxic agents both in open sea and in estuarine areas. Besides,
natural disasters such as landslides and flash floods also contribute
significantly to the increase of marine pollution.
Over the last decades, the use of biomarkers for biomonitoring the
impact of several contaminants has been increased. A biomarker can be
defined as measure at a molecular, cellular or whole organism level, of
the exposure to contaminants (exposure biomarkers) or of the organism
response to the pollutants (effect biomarkers). Genotoxicity
biomonitoring is one of the most important features to evaluate the
environmental stress and the pollution impact on marine organisms. In
this sense, the development of suitable and sensitive biomarkers, such
as those for the assessment of DNA damage, is required.
The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the practical use
of genotoxicity biomarkers in marine bivalve molluscs to evaluate the
extent and consequences of environmental contamination in these
organisms. This review illustrates the results obtained during the
development and application of exposure/effect biomarkers for
biomonitoring purposes in several sentinel species.

PD  - 
AB  - This study explores the frequency of bedrock exposure in a soil-mantled
low-relief (i.e. non-mountainous) landscape. In the High Plains of
eastern Colorado, gully headcuts are among the few erosional features
that will incise through the soil mantle to expose bedrock. We measured
the last time of bedrock exposure using optically stimulated
luminescence dating of alluvial sediment overlying bedrock in gully
headcuts. Our dating suggests that headcuts in adjacent gullies expose
bedrock asynchronously, and therefore, the headcuts are unlikely to have
been triggered by a base-level drop in the trunk stream. This finding
supports the hypothesis that headcuts can develop locally in gullies as
a result of focused scour in locations where hydraulic stress during a
flash flood is sufficiently high, and/or ground cover is sufficiently
weak, to generate a scour hole that undermines vegetation. Alluvium
dating also reveals that gullies have been a persistent part of this
landscape since the early Holocene. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley &

T1  - Sedimentology and preservation of aeolian sediments on steep terrains: Incipient sand ramps on the Atacama coast (northern Chile)
A1  - Ventra, Dario

A1  - de Boer, Poppe L
Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - The origin of topographically controlled aeolian landforms in
high-relief settings is difficult to synthesize under general models,
given the dependence of such accumulations on local morphology.
Quaternary sand ramps have been linked to palaeoclimate, regional
geomorphology and wind patterns; however, controls,on the early
development and preservation of such landforms are poorly known. This
study describes the morphology and sedimentology of complex sedimentary
aprons along steep coastal slopes in the Atacama Desert (Chile). Direct
slope accessibility and continuous stratigraphic exposures enable
comparisons between active processes and stratigraphic signatures.
Stratigraphic fades distribution and its links with patterns of aeolian
deposition show that the preservation of wind-laid sediments depends on
the morphology and processes of specific slope sectors. The spatial
organization of runoff depends on bedrock configuration and directly
controls the permanence or erosion of aeolian sediment. The occurrence
of either water or mass flows depends on the role of aeolian fines in
the rheology of flash floods. In turn, the establishment of a rugged
surface topography controlled by patterns of mass flow deposition
creates local accommodation for aeolian fines, sustaining the initial
aggradation of a colluvial-aeolian system. By contrast, slopes subject
to runoff develop a thin, extensive aeolian mantle whose featureless
surface is subject mostly to sediment bypass down- and across-slope; the
corresponding stratigraphic record comprises almost exclusively thin
debris-flow and sheetflood deposits. Slope morphology and processes are
fundamental in promoting or inhibiting aeolian aggradation in mountain
settings. Long-term sand-ramp construction depends on climate and
regional topography, but the initial development is probably controlled
by local geomorphic factors. The observed interactions between wind and
topography in the study area may also represent a process analogue for
the interpretation of similar geomorphic features on Mars. (C) 2017

AB  - The long-standing dilemma between two extremes in palaeogeographic
interpretation is resolved for the basal 115 m of the eastern exposures
of the Lower Cretaceous Bhuj Formation, at the top of the hydrocarbon
prospective Mesozoics of Kutch, India. An explicit record of a
mega-scale event of relative sea level rise is found sandwiched between
two fluvial stratigraphic intervals that amalgamate only at the eastern
extremity of the exposure of the Formation. A localized estuary in the
middle had its axis roughly parallel to the pre and post-inundation
river channels, although a tributary made a significant detour.
Variation in the fine sandstone-mudstone lithology documents decline in
depositional energy in the mid-estuary amenable to coal formation.
Sediment within the estuary had been routed through both the ends,
palaeocurrent turning shore-parallel only at the estuary-mouth.
Exception arises in case of some isolated lenses of very poorly sorted
and coarse-grained deposits depicting flash floods in the tributary.
Burrow characteristics change delicately in response to the inferred
changes in the depositional scenario along the estuary.
Resting on a coarsening upward ramp the initially fining and then
coarsening upward estuarine succession is prograding, though not
steadily. It was wave-dominated, but tide left imprint behind the
estuary mouth bar gaining in intensity because of valley constriction.
Macroscale changes in relative sea level, perhaps eliciting local
tectonics, are recorded in the transient hysteresis in the stratigraphic
trend with or without palaeocurrent diversions.
The fluvial stratigraphic intervals encasing the marine interval have,
in terms of architectural elements, many commonalities, but also some
significant disparities. The latter indicates channel meandering in the
pre-inundation period and braiding after inundation. Unlike the marine
sandstones, bar-channel sandstones of the riverine deposits are
distinctly less sorted, bimodal, even polymodal in grain-size
distribution. Mineralogical composition identifies the sandstones as
craton-derived, but their geochemical distinctions point to variation in
parent rock composition under the maze of palaeogeographic overprints.

PD  - 
AB  - Mediterranean regions are prone to heavy rainfall, flash floods, and
erosion issues. Drop size distribution (DSD) is a key element for
studying these phenomena through the hydrological variables which can be
derived from it (rainfall rates and totals, kinetic energy fluxes). This
paper proposes a five-year (2012-2016) DSD climatology, summarized by
scaling parameters for concentration, size, and shape. The DSD network
is composed of two longitudinal transects of three OTT Parsivel optical
disdrometers each, across the Mediterranean Cevennes-Vivarais region.
The influence of several factors are analysed: location (distance from
the sea, orographic environment), season, daily synoptic weather
situation (derived from geopotential heights, at 700 and 1000 hPa),
rainfall type (analysed from 5 min radar data), as well as some
combinations of these factors. It was found and/or confirmed that the
orographic environment, season, weather patterns associated with the
exposure to low level atmospheric flows, and rainfall types influenced
the microphysical processes, leading to rainfall, measured at the
ground. Consequently, the DSD characteristics, as well as the
relationships between the rainfall rate and reflectivity factor, are
influenced by these factors.

Y1  - 2011///
PD  - 
AB  - This paper addresses a distinctive event bedset encased by coastal
erg-margin deposits, at a preferred stratigraphic level near the base of
the Neoproterozoic Upper Bhander Sandstone in central India. The bedset
is composed of couplets of sandstone beds that exhibit incisive
amalgamation although they differ in geometry, structures (at soles,
within and at tops of beds), vertical grain-size variation as well as
palaeocurrent pattern and direction. The wide extent of the bedset is
evident from several exposures spread over a distance of more than 50 km
roughly in strike-parallel direction. Flow and depositional dynamics
interpreted from the coupled event beds are more consistent with a
tsunami origin than alternative palaeogeography-compatible models of
climate-induced storm, flash flood or accentuated tide deposits. A
palaeotsunamiite model is thus discussed, with separate incoming and
outgoing components. Considering the overall depositional setting to be
an epeiric sea coast in an intracratonic sag basin, the relevant bedset
is inferred to reflect the record of a teletsunamiite; it would also be
one of the very few Precambrian tsunamiites known so far. Exceptional
preservation of this possible tsunamiite was facilitated by sheltered
deposition behind the backshore zone and the berm, as well as by rapid
burial by wind-deflated sands and advancing aeolian dunes. (C) 2011

AB  - Sandstone massifs with their deep ravines or gorges offer the
instructive opportunity to study the response of organisms to steep
environmental gradients. In 2008-2010, many groups of soil fauna were
studied along transects across three ravines in the Bohemian Switzerland
National Park (north-western Czech Republic), a part of the Elbe
Sandstone Massif. Each transect included five sampling positions: two
opposite edges, two opposite mid-slope positions, and the ravine bottom.
The ravines had a specific microclimate characterized by temperature
inversion. In general, the cooler and more humid ravine bottoms had also
less acid soil with lower carbon content but enriched by litter of
deciduous trees and herbs. The other transect positions were
characterized by spruce (mid-slopes) and pine (edges) stands with mor
humus, exposed to drought in the upper parts. The soil animal
communities (identified to species level) differed substantially in
dependence on their position along the transects. Ravine bottoms hosted
a diverse soil fauna, including a rich macrofauna. The thick duff layer
of acid soils on the slopes and edges hosted a poorer fauna but
supported high densities of important decomposers such as enchytraeids,
oribatid mites and microbivorous nematodes. In general, these were
higher on the slopes, presumably due to the drought exposure of the
edges. Vertical position in the ravine and soil pH were the most
important factors explaining community composition. This confirmed that
the area's high geomorphological diversity, leading to steep
microclimatic gradients and heterogenous soil conditions, is a major
cause of its high biodiversity. A shift in community structure in the
lower parts of the ravines, observed after the first half of the study
period, was possibly caused by summer flash floods. An increased
frequency and severity of dry spells and flash floods due to heavy
rains, predicted by relevant climate warming scenarios, will probably
have an detrimental effect on the ravines'soil fauna. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB  - Environmental geochemistry classifies elements into essential,
non-essential and toxic elements in relationship to human health. To
assess the environmental impact of mining at Datoko-Shega area, the
distributions and concentrations of trace elements in stream sediments
and soil samples were carried out. X-ray fluorescence analytical
technique was used to measure the major and trace element concentrations
in sediments and modified fire assay absorption spectrometry in soils.
The results showed general depletion of major elements except titanium
oxide (TiO2) compared to the average crustal concentrations. The
retention of TiO2 at the near surface environment probably was due to
the intense tropical weathering accompanied by the removal of fine
sediments and soil fractions during the harmattan season by the dry
north-east trade winds and sheet wash deposits formed after flash
floods. The results also showed extreme contamination of selenium (Se),
cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), plus strong contaminations of arsenic
(As) and chromium (Cr) in addition to moderate contamination of lead
(Pb) in the trace element samples relative to crustal averages in the
upper continental crust. However Hg, Pb and Cd concentrations tend to be
high around the artisanal workings. It was recognised from the analysis
of the results that the artisanal mining activity harnessed and
introduces some potentially toxic elements such as Hg, Cd and Pb mostly
in the artisan mine sites. But the interpretation of the trace element
data thus invalidates the elevation of As concentrations to be from the
mine operations. It consequently noticed As values in the mine-impacted
areas to be similar or sometimes lower than As values in areas outside
the mine sites from the stream sediment results.

AB  - Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as estrogens, is
a growing issue for human and animal health as they have been shown to
cause reproductive and developmental abnormalities in wildlife and
plants and have been linked to male infertility disorders in humans.
Intensive farming and weather events, such as storms, flash, flooding,
and landslides, contribute estrogen to waterways used to Supply drinking
water. This paper explores the impact of estrogen exposure on the
performance of slow sand filters (SSFs) used for water treatment. The
feasibility and efficacy of SSF bioaugmentation with estrogen-degrading
bacteria was also investigated, to-determine whether removal of natural
estrogens (estrone, estradiol, and estriol) and overall SSF performarice
for drinking water treatment could be improved. Strains for SSF
augmentation were isolated from full-scale, municipal SSFs so as to
optimize:survival the laboratory-scale SSFs used. concentrations of the
natural estrogens, determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass
spectrometry (GC-MS), revealed augmented SSFs reduced the overall
estrogenic potency of the supplied water by 25% On average and removed
significantly more estrone and estradiol than nonaugmented filters. A
negative correlation was found between coliform removal and estrogen
concentration in nonaugmented filters. This was dire to the toxic
inhibition of protozoa:indicating that high estrogen concentrations can
have functional implications for SSFs (such as impairing coliform.
removal). Consequently, we suggest that high estrogen concentrations
could impact:significantly on water quality production and, in
particular, on pathogen removal in biological water filters.

Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - Research on colluvial depositional systems has recently emphasized
periglacial and high-altitude settings, and the relations between
Quaternary slope stratigraphy and climate change. This article examines
the role of variable slope morphology, surface hydrology and
microclimate in controlling colluvial sedimentation along a coastal
tract of the hyperarid Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Direct
accessibility of active surfaces is accompanied by uninterrupted
stratigraphic exposures along the base of slopes, allowing direct
comparisons between surface processes and the resulting sedimentary
record. Four slope sectors are identified, based on differences in
morphology and processes over active surfaces. Colluvial sedimentation
is controlled by complex interactions of slope gradients and profiles,
exposure to dominant winds, and potential runoff pathways, which vary
considerably between different sectors. Major differences are evident
between these hyperarid deposits and slope sedimentation in periglacial
and temperate settings, including the complete absence of pedogenic
activity and clay minerals; the volume of aeolian deposits and their
role in controlling processes which redistribute sediment downslope,
extending colluvial aprons; and the occurrence of runoff processes only
where favoured by particular topographic configurations. Depositional
surfaces range from steep talus cones, to debris-flow-dominated and
aeolian-dominated colluvial aprons, to an aeolian ramp subject to
reworking by mass flows and flash floods. Consequently, facies
associations and architectures at outcrop are highly variable and
highlight the importance of spatial variations in slope morphology and
processes in producing distinct, coeval colluvial stratigraphies within
a single environmental context. Discrepancies between active processes
and the corresponding stratigraphic signatures are also evident in some
sectors; for example, preservation of alluvial and aeolian facies in
stratigraphic sections does not always reflect the dominant processes
over active slopes. Together with the spatial variability in processes
and deposits along these slopes, this suggests that caution is required
when extracting palaeoenvironmental information from analyses of
colluvial successions.

AB  - The Stuttgart Formation (Schilfsandstein) is approximately 50 m thick in
Thuringia, representing deposition during the ``Mid-Carnian Wet
Intermezzo{''}. Stratigraphically it occurs between the Grabfeld and
Weser formations, which formed under arid conditions. It comprises
NNE-SSW-trending elongate, anastomosing channelized sand-rich bodies
with erosional bases (channel belts) that are several kilometres wide
and pass laterally into predominantly mudstones deposited in interfluve
areas. The source area of these clastics was the uplifted Norwegian
Caledonides. Muddy interfluve facies is dominant in exposures in
Thuringia, Central Germany.
The Lower Stuttgart Formation has an unconformable base that is locally
overlain by metre-thick ``Basal Beds{''}. These consist of grey
mudstones and thin sandstones deposited under humid conditions in
predominantly shallow brackish water environments after a marine
ingression via the Eastern Carpathian/Upper Silesian Gate. The following
30-40 m-grey, fine-grained sandstones, siltstones and mudstones were
deposited in fluvial environments in channel belts and interfluve areas
under humid conditions. These are followed by predominantly reddish
mudstones and sandstones of mainly fluvial origin, deposited under
somewhat drier conditions with seasonal droughts. The Upper Stuttgart
Formation may be more than 16 m thick: it comprises reddish and grey
sandstones and mudstones that were mostly deposited in lake delta
settings by recurring flash floods. During the deposition of this unit
climate was weakly humid with less prominent seasonal draughts.
The modern Ganga Plain of India is an analogue for the depositional
setting of the Stuttgart Formation. Climatic conditions in Ganga Plain
are humid monsoonal with seasonal droughts and roughly comparable with
those interpreted for Mid-Carnian times in Germany. The sandy deposits
of incised channel belts and channels and muddy deposits of interfluve
areas in the Ganga Plain are comparable with the sandstonedominated
channelized facies and mudstone dominated interfluve facies of the
Stuttgart Formation, respectively. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

AB  - The Wachsenburg Sandstone of Thuringia (Central Germany) occurs within
playa deposits of the Arnstadt Formation (Late Triassic, Norian) and
furnishes an example of ephemeral river metamorphosis under dryland
conditions. Characterized by high flow regime features, the
sand-dominated lithofacies constitution exhibits sedimentation by
channel processes under the influence of recurring flash floods. Bearing
signatures of subaerial exposures, the fining-upward lithofacies cycles
are bound by low-angle lateral accretion elements suggesting deposition
in a meandering stream. Channel migration in response to point bar
expansion and active bank erosion, led to the development of four
laterally shifting point bar events. Unimodal palaeocurrent patterns
with low variance and azimuthal dispersion support the point bar origin
of the Wachsenburg Sandstone. With reduced water budget under largely
semi-arid climate, the river progressively became smaller, highly
sinuous and ultimately abandoned. The resulting point bar succession was
finally covered with sheet flow deposits of over bank origin. The
sandstone was deposited during a period of low base-level when the playa
system temporarily fell dry.

Y1  - 2006///
PD  - 
AB  - The Moodies Group in the Dycedale Syncline, Barberton Greenstone Belt
consists of a 100-130 m-thick upward-fining succession that exhibits a
transition from fluvial to tide-modified sedimentation. A basal, 10-30
m-thick conglomerate-sandstone interval of alluvial origin is overlain
by stacked upward-fming, decimeter- to meter-scale cycles within which
three facies are recognized: 1) conglomerate lag; 2) cross-bedded
sandstone; and 3) interlaminated sandstone-siltstone and mudstone.
Within the cycles, the abundance of mudstone drapes increases upwards.
Structureless conglomerates and cross-beds lacking mudstone drapes
record braided-alluvial processes. In contrast, cross-beds with mudstone
drapes and interlaminated sandstone-siltstone and mudstone are products
of flows modified by various tidal beats. Sand and/or silt transport
took place during the ebb and flood stages and mudstone accumulated
during slack water phases. Alternating thick-thin laminations reflect
dominant and subordinate, twice-daily tides. Thicker groupings of
foresets and thicker intervals of vertically stacked sandstone-siltstone
and mudstone laminations are interpreted as spring tide deposits whereas
thinner groupings of foresets and thinner laminations record neap tides.
Desiccated mudstone drapes on foresets indicate that bedforms rarely
were locally exposed during some portion of the tidal cycle. Abundant
exposure structures in the interlaminated sandstone-siltstone and
mudstone facies indicate that the cycles are upward shoaling. The
stacked upward-fining cycles are attributed to alternating subaerial
exposure and fluvial influx followed by marine inundation, probably
related to absolute sea level fluctuations. Lack of high-order
vegetation on the Archean landscape promoted rapid lateral migration or
avulsion of tidally influenced fluvial channels.
The association of facies within the 100-130 m-thick upward-fining
succession is comparable to Holocene and ancient paleovalley fills
characterized by basal alluvial gradational upwards into estuarine
facies. However, in the absence of vegetation, the land-ocean interface
in the Archean probably consisted of laterally extensive fan or braid
deltas rather than point sources of sediment characteristic of most
modem rivers. The abrupt up-section change from syntectonic,
high-energy, alluvial-fluvial flash flood deposits to tide-influenced
sedimentation implies a proximal source that provided sediment to a
shoreline influenced by strong tidal action. Possible Holocene analogues
are orogenic settings such as the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand, the
Indo-Gangetic Plains of India and strike-slip settings such as the Gulf
of Aqaba but all three examples lack a direct transition to tidally
influenced sedimentation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - Alluvial fans at the eastern end of the San Bernardino Mountains in
Southern California provide a record of climate modulated sediment
transfer and erosion, and are deformed and displaced in places by active
faults. Alluvial fans within two study areas, the Mission Creek and the
Whitewater River drainages, were examined using geomorphic,
sedimentological, and Be-10 terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) surface
exposure methods to define the timing of alluvial fan formation and
erosion, and to examine the role of climatic, tectonic and autocyclic
processes. These alluvial fan complexes were studied because they are
amongst the best-preserved successions of alluvial fans in southern
California and they are located at the mouths of two of the largest
drainages, Whitewater River and Mission Creek, in the San Bernardino
Mountains and traverse major faults, the Mission Creek and Banning. The
alluvial fans comprise bouldery debris deposits that represent
deposition dominated by flash flood and debris flow events. TCN surface
exposure dating indicates that abandonment/incision of alluvial fan
surfaces date to early in the Last Glacial or more likely the
penultimate glacial cycle, to marine isotope stage (MIS) 4, and to the
Holocene. The lack of alluvial fan ages during the latter part of the
Last Glacial (MIS 2 and 3) suggests that there has been little alluvial
fan lobe deposition/incision during that time. This is similar to
findings for many other alluvial fans throughout the American Southwest,
and supports the view that there is a strong climatic control on
alluvial fan formation throughout this region. Furthermore, the oldest
alluvial fan surfaces in the Mission Creek region are beheaded by the
Whitewater River drainage, showing that the oldest alluvial fans in the
Mission Creek region underwent significant capture by the Whitewater
River drainage. This shows the autocyclic controls are also important on
alluvial fan evolution in this region; but the importance of these
processes to alluvial fan development in other regions of the American
Southwest needs to be more fully assessed. The alluvial fans in the
Mission Creek area traverse the Mission Creek fault, but are not
deformed by it, which suggests that there may have been little if any
movement along this fault since at least MIS 4. In contrast, alluvial
fans in the Whitewater River study are displaced by active faults
highlighting the influence of tectonism on alluvial fan development in
this region. In addition to illustrating the importance of climatic
controls on the development of alluvial fans in the American Southwest,
a classic region for alluvial fan studies, this study illustrates the
complex mixture of autocyclic and allocyclic factors that force alluvial
fan development in tectonically active settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

PD  - 
AB  - A central question in biology is how spatial information is conveyed to
locally establish a developmental program. Rice (Oryza sativa) can
survive flash floods by the emergence of adventitious roots from the
stem. Epidermal cells that overlie adventitious root primordia undergo
cell death to facilitate root emergence. Root growth and epidermal cell
death are both controlled by ethylene. This study aimed to identify the
signal responsible for the spatial control of cell death. Epidermal cell
death correlated with the proximity to root primordia in wild-type and
ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 plants, indicating that the root emits a spatial
signal. Ethylene-induced root growth generated a mechanical force of
similar to 18 millinewtons within 1 h. Force application to epidermal
cells above root primordia caused cell death in a dose-dependent manner
and was inhibited by 1-methylcyclopropene or diphenylene iodonium, an
inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. Exposure of epidermal cells not overlying a
root to either force and ethylene or force and the catalase inhibitor
aminotriazole induced ectopic cell death. Genetic downregulation of the
reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger METALLOTHIONEIN2b likewise
promoted force-induced ectopic cell death. Hence, reprogramming of
epidermal cell fate by the volatile plant hormone ethylene requires two
signals: mechanosensing for spatial resolution and ROS for cell death
signaling.

T1  - Sedimentology and progressive tectonic unconformities of the sheetflood-dominated Hell's Gate alluvial fan, Death Valley, California
A1  - Blair, T C
Y1  - 2000///
PD  - 
AB  - The Hell's Gate alluvial fan of northern Death Valley has an area of
49.5 km(2), a radius of 1 1.8 km, and a smooth 5-3 degrees sloping
surface interrupted by shallow (<0.5 m), radially aligned gullies 1-4 m
wide. Facies analysis of 1-14 m high exposures at 45 sites reveals that
the fan is built almost entirely by water-flow processes. Two facies
deposited by sheetflooding dominate the exposures from apex to toe. The
main one (Facies A), comprising 80-95% of the cuts, consists of sandy,
granular, fine to medium pebble gravel that alternates with cobbly,
coarse to very coarse pebble gravel in planar-stratified couplets 5-20
cm thick that are aligned parallel to the fan surface. Facies B,
comprising 0-10% of the exposures, consists of 10-40 cm thick
wedge-planar beds of sandy pebble gravel in backsets dipping 5 to 24
degrees. Both Facies A and B are produced by infrequent sediment-charged
flash floods from the catchment, and accumulate on the fan from
supercritical standing waves of an expanding sheetflood. Antidune
backsets are deposited during the buildup stage of the standing-wave
cycle, and the couplers during the washout stage. The autocyclic growth
and destruction of standing waves during a single sheetflood produces
50-25 cm thick sequences of multiple couplers with backsets. Couplers
prevail over antidunes due to the selective preservation of deposits of
the standing wave washout phase. Three minor facies comprise 5-20% of
the fan exposures. The most common one (Facies D) is pebbly cobble
gravel in lenticular beds typically 5-25 cm thick that overlie erosional
scours into sheetflood deposits. Tt comprises gravel concentrated in
gullies by fine-fraction winnowing of sheetflood units during
recessional flood or by secondary overland flows. Though common on the
fan surface, this facies is stratigraphically limited. Facies C consists
of medium- to very fine-grained eolian sandsheet deposits 5-30 cm thick
present on the distal fan in association with gully-fill gravel. It
forms by wind reworking of the fan surface, and by sand transport from
the adjoining erg. Facies C and D gully-fill and eolian deposits
together comprise bounding beds that divide successive sheetflood
sequences. They record secondary processes active on the surface between
infrequent sheetfloods that mainly aggrade the fan. The fifth fan facies
(Facies E) consists of lakeshore gravel deposited along the distal fan
when it was transgressed by Lake Manly during latest Pleistocene time.
The medial 3.8 km part of the Hell's Gate fan is uplifted and backtilted
1 to 16 degrees into a tectonic ridge formed during strike-slip motion
along the North Death Valley fault. Progressive intrafan unconformities,
each likely initiated during one large earthquake, are common in these
deposits, Two to eight sheetflood units capped by gully-fill or eolian
facies are exposed within unconformity-bounded intervals, indicating
that fan-aggrading catastrophic sheetfloods on a given part of fan are 2
to greater than or equal to 8 times more frequent than earthquakes that
cause backtilting. (C) 2000 Elsevier science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two important factors influencing rice plant survival during submergence
are limitations to gas diffusion under water, and reduced irradiance
that impair photosynthesis and efficient utilization of carbohydrates.
Thus, survival during submergence may largely depend on accumulation of
high carbohydrate concentrations prior to submergence and a capacity for
maintaining energy production through rapid alcoholic fermentation under
oxygen shortage. During flash flooding, a third factor thought to affect
survival is the aerobic shock during the post-submergence period when
floodwaters recede. Changes in the level of antioxidants and enzymes
such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) suggest that tolerant rice cultivars
develop protective systems to air after exposure to hypoxic or anoxic
environments. These responses are similar to other wetland plants.
The capacity to survive submergence depends not only on specific
environmental factors, but also on the strategy that plants have evolved
for adoption to particular flood-prone environments. In rice the two
main strategies are to elongate and escape, or not to elongate and
conserve resources. For rainfed lowland rice exposed to flash flooding,
elongation growth during complete submergence has major adverse effects
on survival, presumably since this competes with maintenance processes
which require carbohydrates and energy. Selection for minimal elongation
during submergence is currently being exploited as a trait for
submergence tolerance by tainted lowland rice breeders in south and
southeast Asia.
Gene mapping for submergence tolerance has been useful in identifying
one prominent locus for submergence tolerance. Fine scale gene mapping
and sequencing may facilitate further progress in the physiology and
genetics of submergence tolerance. Recently published data demonstrate
that improving submergence tolerance may be possible through
up-regulation of genes for particular traits such as pyruvate
decarboxylase (PDC) for alcoholic fermentation. Validation of
appropriate mechanisms in other cultivars for target environments, and
development and utilization of molecular markers to follow these traits
in breeding programs, will therefore be high priorities for future work
on submergence tolerance of rice. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All
