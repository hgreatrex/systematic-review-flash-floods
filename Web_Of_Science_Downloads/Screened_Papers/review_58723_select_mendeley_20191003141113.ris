AB  - The current study aims to assess the level of socio-economic
vulnerability to floods and flash-floods (FF) in the context of
environmental change, as well as in relation to the mitigation measures
undertaken by local authorities to cope with these phenomena.
The study area is located in the Bend Subcarpathians (Romania), a region
recognized for its high tectonic mobility and dynamics of
hydro-geomorphic processes (e. g. floods and flash floods, landslides).
The case study area was significantly affected by FF events (e. g. 1975,
2005, 2010), with a high impact on rural settlements in terms of
significant losses to their assets. A system of socio-economic
vulnerability indicators, developed within the VULMIN project, have been
used to assess the socio-economic vulnerability to floods and FF impact
at the level of rural settlements (LAU2 level), including social
indicators (e. g. human capital, accessibility, livelihood conditions),
as well as economic indicators (e. g. economic well-being).

AB  - The morphometric analysis of river basins represents a simple procedure
to describe hydrologic and geomorphic processes operating on a basin
scale. A morphometric analysis was carried out to evaluate the drainage
characteristics of two adjoining, mountain river basins of the southern
Western Ghats, India, Muthirapuzha River Basin (MRB) in the western
slopes and Pambar River Basin (PRB) in the eastern slopes. The basins,
forming a part of the Proterozoic, high-grade, Southern Granulite
Terrain of the Peninsular India, are carved out of a terrain dominantly
made of granite- and hornblende-biotite gneisses. The Western Ghats,
forming the basin divide, significantly influences the regional climate
(i.e., humid climate in MRB, while semi-arid in PRB). The Survey of
India topographic maps (1:50,000) and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
digital elevation data were used as the base for delineation and
analysis. Both river basins are of 6th order and comparable in basin
geometry. The drainage patterns and linear alignment of the drainage
networks suggest the influence of structural elements. The Rb of either
basins failed to highlight the structural controls on drainage
organization, which might be a result of the elongated basin shape. The
irregular trends in Rb between various stream orders suggest the
influence of geology and relief on drainage branching. The Dd values
designate the basins as moderate- to well-drained with lower
infiltration rates. The overall increasing trend of Rl between
successive stream orders suggests a geomorphic maturity of either basins
and confirmed by the characteristic I (hyp) values. The Re values imply
an elongate shape for both MRB and PRB and subsequently lower
vulnerability to flash floods and hence, easier flood management. The
relatively higher Rr of PRB is an indicative of comparatively steeply
sloping terrain and consequently higher intensity of erosion processes.
Further, the derivatives of digital elevation data (slope, aspect,
topographic wetness index, and stream power index), showing significant
differences between MRB and PRB, are useful in soil conservation plans.
The study highlighted the variation in morphometric parameters with
respect to the dissimilarities in topography and climate.

AB  - Despite the fact that the torrential floods and forest fires in this
century caused enormous damage to Serbia, there are no cadasters of
torrential streams for most parts of the country, and there was no
forest fires susceptibility zonation, whose indirect consequences
include the intensification of torrential flooding. Therefore, it is
necessary to approach solving these problems at a higher level, taking
into account the synergistic effects of these disasters. In the
catchment area of the Josanicka river, not only in this century, floods
and forest fires have represented a very significant factors of the
environmental change. For taking appropriate measures and reducing the
possible consequences of these disasters in the near future, it is
necessary to determine the most vulnerable areas, using various
susceptibility indexes, GIS and remote sensing, but also to show how
eventual occurrence of forest fires in such areas would result in
increased flash flood vulnerability. Part of the Josanicka river basin
is situated in National Park ``Kopaonik{''}, and the Josanicka spa,
which could be, by its characteristics, one of the leaders of spa
tourism in Serbia, is located in that basin, which further increases the
need for protection of this territory from these hazards.

AB  - Matoupu Town, an important residential area in the lower reach of the
South Censhui River, is severely threatened by flash floods. The
watershed of the South Censhui River locates in the mountainous area of
northwest Hunan province where has been frequented by flash floods. The
analysis on flash flood risk at the town was performed by hazard level
of flash flood and vulnerability level of exposures. First of all, the
hazard information of the town was obtained at the entire South Censhui
River watershed level using HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS. For more precision,
both hydrological and hydraulic methods were used to the hazard level
analysis in this study for hazard information on flooding area, water
surface profile, water depth, flow velocity, and flood process. The
hazard level was mainly determined by flooding areas of flash floods
with various return periods. Secondly, the vulnerability level was
determined by the types of land use within the town. Thirdly, Hazard
Vulnerability Block method (HVB) was used for flash flood risk level
classification; both hazard and vulnerability were classified into three
levels of low, medium and high. Finally, the analytical results
indicated that it is very important to make flash flood risk assessment
for flash flood management in Matoupu Town in the fields of land use
planning, early warning system construction, emergency management and
risk awareness.

AB  - Change of climate is unequivocal, and many of the observed changes are
unprecedented over five decades to millennia. It is expected that the
global atmosphere and ocean is increasingly getting warmer, the amount
of ice on the earth is decreasing over the oceans, and the sea level has
risen. According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, such
temperature change is around 0.78 degrees C over decades. Without
international collaboration towards Paris Agreement, the temperature
change could potentially rise over 5.5 degrees C in 2100. In addition,
it is highly likely that even such a small change can trigger the worst
of other extreme natural threats to interdependent urban and transport
infrastructure systems. The vulnerability of those infrastructure
systems has not been comprehensively addressed in open literature due to
the fact that the actual climate change impact depends on specific
differences of local environmental and geographical conditions. As a
result, our research will highlight the extremes that can lead to system
failure, degraded operation and ultimately, delays to train services.
The emphasis is placed on the newly proposed Malaysia-Singapore high
speed rail network, which can be affected by the most-frequent severe
weather conditions including heavy rainfall and flash flood. It is found
that tunnelling, steep cutting and ballast foundation are ones of the
most vulnerable assets from a heavy rainfall or a flash flood.

AB  - Several different factors external to the natural hazard of flash
flooding can contribute to the type and magnitude of their resulting
damages. Human exposure, vulnerability, fatality and injury rates can be
minimized by identifying and then mitigating the causative factors for
human impacts. A database of flash flooding was used for statistical
analysis of human impacts across the U.S. 21,549 flash flood events were
analyzed during a 6-year period from October 2006 to 2012. Based on the
information available in the database, physical parameters were
introduced and then correlated to the reported human impacts.
Probability density functions of the frequency of flash flood events and
the PDF of occurrences weighted by the number of injuries and fatalities
were used to describe the influence of each parameter.
The factors that emerged as the most influential on human impacts are
short flood durations, small catchment sizes in rural areas, vehicles,
and nocturnal events with low visibility. Analyzing and correlating a
diverse range of parameters to human impacts give us important insights
into what contributes to fatalities and injuries and further raises
questions on how to manage them. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Highlands management in a flood-prone watershed: Does reflexive reciprocity make a difference?
A1  - Versluis, Anna
Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - Poor levels of reciprocity (or ``upstream/downstream{''} situations) are
believed to discourage responsible actions and thus make sustainability
harder to achieve. This paper presents a study that compares land use
management resulting from concurrent reflexive reciprocal and
nonreciprocal relationships in a Haitian watershed. The watershed is
typically nonreciprocal in that flash floods and debris flows affecting
the lowlands are thought to be initiated by upslope land management. It
differs from conventional nonreciprocal cases in that the majority of
people living in the lowlands own or otherwise manage upslope land.
Concepts of reciprocity and self-interest indicate that
downslope-residing land managers should implement more upland
hazard-reduction conservation practices than upslope-residing land
managers. This idea was tested using data on the number of soil
conservation measures applied to upslope land parcels. The resulting
multilevel model demonstrated that downslope households report employing
more soil conservation measures in their upslope fields than upslope
households. Additional communal actions to increase assurances of
working in concert, however, are still needed to reduce disaster
vulnerability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Between 10th and 11th November, 2014, heavy rainfall over a short period
fell on the eastern Genoa metropolitan area. The geohydrological event
had important ground effects, among them the simultaneous flooding of
Entella and Rupinaro streams, in Chiavari city. In lower Lavagna valley,
the main tributary of the Entella, a landslide caused two casualties,
while serious damage to buildings and infrastructures were registered in
Chiavari's Old Town and in the nearby communities of Carasco and
Cogorno. In the Entella basin, the rainfall peaked at 60 mm/hour and
accumulated 220 mm in six hours. The levels of the streams rose
instantly, showing concentration times of less than an hour. The Entella
rose seven meters, flooding Carasco, Cogorno, and the Caperana
neighborhood of Chiavari. Flash flooding of the Rupinaro stream caused
water to rise to 1.5 m in Chiavari's historic core. Analyses were
carried out of the weather conditions and the ground effects of the
events; in addition, studies were made of the main causes of the
geo-hydrological risk. In particular, variations in climate and
uncontrolled urban development were the cause of increased
geo-hydrological hazards and vulnerability of this area, historically
subject to flooding. Such conditions of risk are unacceptable, and
urgent measures are required to mitigate the effects of heavy rainfall
events.

AB  - Flash floods are typical for the Mediterranean region, however they have
been recurring at increasing frequency over the past few decades
especially over the Italian Peninsula. The region of Genoa has recently
moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous
flash floods of the Bisagno River and its tributaries as a result of
intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last
flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011
and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the
increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall
regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This
study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects
of the Bisagno River flash flood of October 9th, 2014 in the city of
Genoa. Application of a Standard Anomaly Index and a Cluster Analysis
reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded
in the Bisagno Valley for the period of 1945-2016. Urban sprawl in the
catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and
photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total
consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding
Genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in
rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to
increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land
use change, including in particular transformations of the Bisagno
riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to
mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen
observatory for early warning of flash floods.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper describes an analysis of the factors surrounding a post-fire
flooding event that occurred in the Alpine Shire, Victoria, Australia in
late February 2003. Flash flooding occurred because of highly localised
thunderstorms and was enhanced by the burned landscape. In addition, our
analysis of the resulting situation suggests that other contributing
factors included the storm cells likely being pulse wet microburst, cell
regeneration over the same area, and the steepness of the Buckland River
Catchment. The synoptic conditions surrounding the event suggest that
the major drivers of the extreme rainfall event were the high levels of
precipitable water in the atmosphere and enhanced atmospheric
instability (including associated high CAPE values) from increased
surface heating due to the reduction in surface albedo and soil moisture
of the recently burned fire surface. In addition, weak upper atmospheric
winds during the flash flood event contributed to slow storm movement.
Hydrological modelling of the flash flooding event further indicated
that fire-induced soil hydrophobicity was likely to have caused an
enhancement of the hydrological response of the catchment. With an
increase in frequency of fires expected in the Alpine Shire associated
with anthropogenic climate change, the relationship between fire and
flood, even for rare events, has implications for emergency managers and
Alpine Shire residents. It is intended that the results of this study
will assist in emergency preparedness and thereby contribute to a
reduction in the vulnerability of fire-affected communities to post-fire
flash floods.

AB  - Coastal towns along the coast of Africa are among the most vulnerable to
climate change impacts such as flooding and sea level rise. Yet, because
coastal conditions in many parts of the region are poorly understood,
knowledge on which population groups are at the most risk is less known,
particularly in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) of Ghana,
where the capital city Accra is located. Without adequate information
about the risk levels and why, the implementation of locally appropriate
adaptation plans may be less effective. This study enriches our
understanding of the levels of flood risks along the coast of GAMA and
contributes knowledge to improve understanding of place-specific
adaptation plans. The study uses data from a 300-household survey,
stakeholder meetings, and interviews with local community leaders to
construct an integrated vulnerability index. The index includes seven
components made up of: dwelling type; house and house environment;
household socioeconomic characteristics; experience and perception of
flood risk; household and community flood adaptation strategies; house
location, and physical characteristics. Our findings show that exposure
to floods, particularly from local flash floods is relatively high in
all communities. However, significant differences in sensitivity and
adaptive capacity of the communities were observed due to differences in
location, socioeconomic characteristics, and perception of risks to
flooding and sea level rise. The complexity of factors involved in the
determination of local-level vulnerability requires that the
implementation of adaptation strategies needs to involve cross-sectorial
partnerships, involving local communities, in building a comprehensive
multi-risk adaptation strategy.

PD  - 
AB  - Changes in society's vulnerability to natural hazards are important to
understand, as they determine current and future risks, and the need to
improve protection. Very large impacts including high numbers of
fatalities occur due to single storm surge flood events. Here, we report
on impacts of global coastal storm surge events since the year 1900,
based on a compilation of events and data on loss of life. We find that
over the past, more than eight thousand people are killed and 1.5
million people are affected annually by storm surges. The occurrence of
very substantial loss of life (>10 000 persons) from single events has
however decreased over time. Moreover, there is a consistent decrease in
event mortality, measured by the fraction of exposed people that are
killed, for all global regions, except South East Asia. Average
mortality for storm surges is slightly higher than for river floods, but
lower than for flash floods. We also find that for the same coastal
surge water level, mortality has decreased over time. This indicates
that risk reduction efforts have been successful, but need to be
continued with projected climate change, increased rates of sea-level
rise and urbanisation in coastal zones.

PD  - 
AB  - In flash flood prone areas, roads are often the first assets affected by
inundations which make rescue operations difficult and represent a major
threat to lives: almost half of the victims are car passengers trapped
by floods. In the past years, the Gard region (France) road management
services have realized an extensive inventory of the known road
submersions that occurred during the last 40 years. This inventory
provided an unique opportunity to analyse the causes of road flooding in
an area frequently affected by severe flash floods. It will be used to
develop a road submersion susceptibility rating method, representing the
first element of a road warning system.
This paper presents the results of the analysis of this data set. A
companion paper will show how the proposed road susceptibility rating
method can be combined with distributed rainfall-runoff simulations to
provide accurate road submersion risk maps.
The very low correlation between the various possible explanatory
factors and the susceptibility to flooding measured by the number of
past observed submersions implied the use of particular statistical
analysis methods based on the general principals of the discriminant
analysis.
The analysis led to the definition of four susceptibility classes for
river crossing road sections. Validation tests confirmed that this
classification is robust, at least in the considered area. One major
outcome of the analysis is that the susceptibility to flooding is rather
linked to the location of the road sections than to the size of the
river crossing structure (bridge or culvert).

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Given the significant worldwide human and economic losses caused due to
floods annually, reducing the negative consequences of these hazards is
a major concern in development strategies at different spatial scales. A
basic step in flood risk management is identifying areas susceptible to
flood occurrences. This paper proposes a methodology allowing the
identification of areas with high potential of accelerated surface
run-off and consequently, of flash-flood occurrences. The methodology
involves assessment and mapping in GIS environment of flash flood
potential index (FFPI), by integrating two statistical methods:
frequency ratio and weights-of-evidence. The methodology was applied for
Basca Chiojdului River catchment (340 km(2)), located in the Carpathians
Curvature region (Romania). Firstly, the areas with torrential phenomena
were identified and the main factors controlling the surface run-off
were selected (in this study nine geographical factors were considered).
Based on the features of the considered factors, many classes were set
for each of them. In the next step, the weights of each class/category
of the considered factors were determined, by identifying their spatial
relationships with the presence or absence of torrential phenomena.
Finally, the weights for each class/category of geographical factors
were summarized in GIS, resulting the FFPI values for each of the two
statistical methods. These values were divided into five classes of
intensity and were mapped. The final results were used to estimate the
flash-flood potential and also to identify the most susceptible areas to
this phenomenon. Thus, the high and very high values of FFPI
characterize more than one-third of the study catchment. The result
validation was performed by (i) quantifying the rate of the number of
pixels corresponding to the torrential phenomena considered for the
study (training area) and for the results' testing (validating area) and
(ii) plotting the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve.

AB  - The present paper shows an in-depth analysis of the evolution of floods
and precipitation in Catalonia for the period 1981-2010. In order to
have homogeneous information, and having in mind that not gauge data was
available for all the events, neither for all the rivers and stream
flows, daily press from a specific newspaper has been systematically
analysed for this period. Furthermore a comparison with a longer period
starting in 1900 has been done. 219 flood events (mainly flash flood
events) have been identified for the period of 30 years (375 starting in
1900), 79 of them were ordinary, 117 of them were extraordinary and 23
of them were catastrophic, being autumn and summer the seasons with the
maxima values. 19% of the events caused a total of 110 casualties. 60%
of them died when they tried to cross the street or the stream. Factors
like the evolution of precipitation, population density and other
socio-economical aspects have been considered. The trend analysis shows
an increase of 1 flood/decade that probably has been mainly due to
inter-annual and intra-annual changes in population density and in
land-use and land-cover. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cognition of risk is the first step in reducing disaster damage and
losses. In this study, risk cognition in the Hani Rice Terraces, the
core tourism attraction in Yuanyang County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan,
China, is analyzed based on field survey and participatory geographic
information system (GIS). The results show that tourism communities have
cognition of risk; are more sensitive to hazards (especially drought);
have more severe potential damage and losses from hazards; and also have
more enthusiasm to adapt to disaster risk, when compared with a
non-tourism community. On disaster vulnerability maps, the tourism
communities identified the unique ``Forest - Village - Terrace -
River{''} landscape while the non-tourism community only recognized the
terrace and the village as the main elements affected by hazard. Also,
the tourism communities had deeper understandings of drought, flash
floods and landslide disaster risks. A conceptual model based on
``Pressure - State - Response{''} relationships is put forward to
explore the situation in which, in the tourism community, terraces have
a greater variety of functions and enhanced values resulting in the
spatial expansion of hazard effects.

AB  - Climate change has raised awareness about the shifts in the distribution
and timing of river flooding in many European regions (e.g. northern,
central) which were affected by more frequent, intense and unpredictable
extreme hydrological events in the last decades, inducing significant
impacts on vulnerable human communities. Some recent severe flood events
(e.g. 2005, 2010) produced extensive societal and economic impacts in
Romania due to above normal precipitation. The Curvature Carpathians and
Subcarpathians experienced the adverse effects of floods and
flash-floods (FF) in response to the heavy rainfalls of 2005 and 2010,
especially in small river catchments (below 200 km(2)), implying great
losses to local community's assets and transport infrastructure. The
study aims at identifying the ``pillars{''} of the current level of
resilience, as well as the possible premises for improving the community
resilience and its capacity in coping with these hazards, in relation to
the underlying socioeconomic factors causing vulnerability. The research
findings identified a high level of individual awareness and worry of FF
risk, but a limited preparedness, due to several factors e.g. the
community-based programs for FF emergency training and behavioral
exercises in both selected river catchments, limited perceived
effectiveness of flood prevention/protection measures undertaken by the
authorities. Several valuable premises for building individual and
community resilience have been identified e.g. the existence of a
``self-resilience mechanism{''} within the community, mandatory
household insurance schemes.

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Social vulnerability explains the sociological and human-dependent
circumstances that translate a natural event into a deadly disaster.
But, what are the space-time characteristics of vulnerability (i.e.,
dynamic vulnerability) that influence how people are impacted by a
specific natural hazard? This paper performs a critical analysis of
previous flood-related human impact and vulnerability studies to better
understand and summarize the human-related factors that determine the
impacts from flash flood events. The paper is motivated by the
hypothesis that the intersection of the spatiotemporal context of the
hazard with the distribution of people and their characteristics across
space and time reveals different paths of vulnerability and defines the
most probable space of an exposed area in terms of deadly impacts. Based
on this idea, a conceptual model for assessing vulnerability to flash
flooding is developed and presented herein. The most important advance
of the current research in comparison with previous efforts in
vulnerability assessment is the introduction of the concept of the
spatial and temporal variability of vulnerability. This means that the
proposed conceptual model does not consider vulnerability as a static
synopsis that can be described by a single map, but as an ever-evolving
process derived from the interaction of social and physical dynamics.
The dynamic perspective of vulnerability is key for the identification
of pertinent vulnerability variables to be used for flash flood
vulnerability assessment and dynamic mapping, and prediction.

T1  - Assessment of the flash flood potential of BA cent sca River Catchment (Romania) based on physiographic factors
A1  - Minea, Gabriel
Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to identify areas with high flash-flood
potential based on an evaluation of physiographic factors controlling
the formation of surface runoff. The research method relies on the use
of the Flash Flood Potential Index (FFPI), which incorporates
physiographic characteristics from the catchment (terrain slope, profile
curvature, land use and soil texture). The spatial distribution of the
physiographic factors (which contribute to the creation, control and
concentration within the drainage network of the overland flow) and the
classified zoning of areas according to their hydrological response were
achieved with GIS techniques. The results obtained show that
physiographic factors on 227 sq km (29%) favor surface runoff on slopes
and its localization towards the drainage network. Notably, the highest
values of FFPI belong to the lower part of the catchment, where high
human population density can be found, reflecting an increased
vulnerability to floods and inundations of this area.

AB  - Dealing with flood hazard and risk requires approaches rooted in both
natural and social sciences, which provided the nexus for the ongoing
debate on sociohydrology. Various combinations of non-structural and
structural flood risk reduction options are available to communities.
Focusing on flood risk and the information associated with it,
developing risk management plans is required but often overlooks public
perception of a threat. The perception of risk varies in many different
ways, especially between the authorities and the affected public. It is
because of this disconnection that many risk management plans concerning
floods have failed in the past. This paper examines the private
adaptation capacity and willingness with respect to flooding in two
different catchments in Greece prone to multiple flood events during the
last 20 years. Two studies (East Attica and Evros) were carried out,
comprised of a survey questionnaire of 155 and 157 individuals, from a
periurban (East Attica) and a rural (Evros) area, respectively, and they
focused on those vulnerable to periodic (rural area) and flash floods
(peri-urban area). Based on the comparisons drawn from these responses,
and identifying key issues to be addressed when flood risk management
plans are implemented, improvements are being recommended for the social
dimension surrounding such implementation. As such, the paper
contributes to the ongoing discussion on human-environment interaction
in socio-hydrology.

PD  - 
AB  - Transportation networks as a critical infrastructure are at increasing
risk of flooding and thus damaging disruption. The resulted disruption
even in small flood events may impose indirect damages which needs to be
quantified to better manage traffic flows. In this paper, a framework
was developed to address the vulnerability of transportation networks to
pluvial and coastal flooding based on a state-of-the-art
depth-disruption function which estimates flood depth impact on
vehicle's speed reduction. In this framework, the flood depth was
modeled using a static and hydrodynamic model and then assigned to each
road segment. By turning flood depth into factors causing increase in
travel time, the service area of four emergency services were calculated
and the effect of coastal and pluvial flooding on road networks were
discussed. The Lower Manhattan in New York City was selected as a case
study. Results show that this framework provides better insights into
determining critical road segments and subsequently traffic management
during flooding events.

PD  - 
AB  - Being mainly an agricultural country the economy of India and its growth
mainly depends on the vagaries of the weather and in particular the
extreme weather events. India with a land of unique climatic regime due
to several characteristic features, including (i) two monsoon seasons
(south-west and north-east) leading to drought & flood condition,
active and break cycle of monsoon and also heavy rainfall leading to
flash flood and landslides, (ii) two cyclone seasons (pre and
post-monsoon cyclone seasons), (iii) hot weather season characterized by
severe thunderstorms, dust storms and heat waves, (iv) cold weather
season characterized by violent snow storms in the Himalayan regions,
cold waves and fog. The socio-economic impacts of the extreme weather
events such as floods, droughts, heavy rainfall, cyclones, hail storm,
thunderstorm, heat and cold waves have been increasing due to large
growth of population and urbanizations, which has led to greater
vulnerability. A spatio-temporal analysis of these weather extremes over
India will be very helpful to understand the vulnerability potential and
to improve the forecast skill and use these forecasts in minimizing the
adverse impacts of such weather extremes.

AB  - Coastal locations in the Mediterranean area experienced several
geo-hydrological events from the beginning of the 3rd Millennium. Among
the most flooded areas featuring the Ligurian coastal environment, Genoa
is sorrowfully at international level, for the flash flood
characteristics and consequent damage: the last event of 4 November
2011, once again, caused the loss of human lives. Genoa, in fact, can be
considered an interesting case study for geo-hydrological risks: it can
be said that to a general trend of increasing hazard, due to global and
particular climate changes of the Mediterranean area, corresponds an
increase of the vulnerability due to the urban growth on the flood
plains. In this paper are analyzed the unusual meteorological
characteristics of the Gulf of Genoa, the changes in the rate of daily
precipitation using the recorded data at the station of Genoa, in use
since 1833. The most significant periods of the land urban development
are also briefly described. They have determined important changes of
the territory, modifying the water balance of the basins in a
considerable way.

AB  - In recent years, hazardous flash flooding has caused human deaths and
damages to urban infrastructures in Saudi Arabian cities. This study has
computed, mapped, and analyzed the physical vulnerability, social
vulnerability, and overall composite flash flood vulnerability (CFVI)
indices using a simulated flood and 2006 census data on seven social
variables for 153 neighborhoods of the City of Riyadh, the capital of
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The physical vulnerability index was
computed by ranking a potential flood depth map created by simulating a
6 h of high-intense rainfall in the city. The social vulnerability index
was constructed by standardizing the social data variables. Finally, the
two indices were multiplied to create the CFVI. The CFVI map revealed
that the low-lying central and southern half of the city is highly
vulnerable; northern and northeastern peripheral neighborhoods are
moderately to highly vulnerable; and the mountainous western
neighborhoods are the least vulnerable to flash flooding. Low-income and
unemployed expatriate families living in densely populated central,
south, and southeastern neighborhoods are more vulnerable to flooding
than rich Saudi families living in the sparsely populated northern half
of the central city, western, northwestern, and southwestern
neighborhoods. The CFVI map will help city planners to formulate
effective flood control measures to protect the city residents and urban
infrastructures from future flood damage. This flood vulnerability
research can be expanded to other Saudi cities by incorporating more
physical and social variables.

T1  - Stakeholder perspectives on barriers to landslide risk governance
A1  - Scolobig, Anna
Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - European Union directives as well as national legislation are placing
great emphasis on the inclusion of stakeholder perspectives in the
governance of risks from natural hazards. This should help decision
makers formulate better policies. However, to date, there is little
information on stakeholders' perspectives with respect to landslide risk
governance. This paper addresses the gap by reporting on research in
Nocera Inferiore, Italy. The research is based on a documentary
analysis, 43 semi-structured interviews and a survey submitted to 373
residents. The political instability, the unfairness of national funding
allocation across municipalities and the residents' lack of knowledge
about risk assessment and emergency planning are some of the main
barriers to effective risk governance. Moreover, there are divergent,
sometimes even opposite, stakeholders' views on several issues, such as
the relevance of illegal development in risky areas. The results
highlight the importance of addressing these divergent views and
including the plurality of voices as a prerequisite for inclusive risk
governance. The research provided essential background information for a
participatory process, which was designed to support decisions on
landslide risk mitigation measures in Nocera Inferiore (Linnerooth-Bayer
et al. this issue). The methodology will be of more general interest to
researchers and policy-makers intent upon including stakeholder
perspectives in natural risk governance.

AB  - In urban areas prone to flash floods, characterization of social
resilience is critical to guarantee the success of emergency management
plans. In this study, we present the methodological approach that led to
the submission and subsequent approval of the Civil Protection Plan of
Navaluenga (Central Spain), in which the first phase was to analyse
flood hazard by combining the Hydrological Modelling System (HEC-HMS)
and the Iber 2D hydrodynamic model. We then analysed social
vulnerability and designed measures to put into practice within the
framework of the Civil Protection Plan. At a later phase, we assessed
citizens' flash-flood risk perception and level of awareness regarding
some key variables of the Civil Protection Plan. To this end, 254 adults
representing roughly 12% of the population census were interviewed.
Responses were analysed descriptively, comparing awareness regarding
preparedness and response actions with the corresponding information and
behaviours previously defined in the Civil Protection Plan. In addition,
we carried out a latent class cluster analysis aimed at identifying the
different groups present among the interviewees. Our results showed that
risk perception is low. Specifically, 60.8% of the interviewees showed
low risk perception and low awareness (cluster 1); 24.4% had high risk
perception and low awareness (cluster 2), while the remaining 14.8%
presented high long-term risk perception and high awareness (cluster 3).
These findings suggest the need for integrating these key variables of
social risk perception and local tailored information in emergency
management plans, especially in urban areas prone to flash-floods where
response times are limited. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T1  - A qualitative study of mobile home resident perspectives on tornadoes and tornado protective actions in South Carolina, USA
A1  - Ash, Kevin D
Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Occupants of mobile or manufactured homes in the United States of
America (USA) are highly exposed and susceptible to injury or death from
tornado hazards. This problem is most pronounced in the southern and
eastern USA, where tornadoes are frequent and mobile homes comprise
upwards of 15 % of the housing stock. Recognizing this vulnerability,
emergency management entities and the USA National Weather Service often
recommend that mobile home residents evacuate to a nearby sturdy
building or a specially-built tornado shelter when tornadoes threaten
their communities. Previous research suggests, however, that only 30 %
of residents follow this recommendation. In this research I aim to
provide insight as to why many mobile home residents seldom undertake
the suggested course of action for tornadoes. Using excerpts from twenty
semi-structured interviews conducted during 2013 in South Carolina, I
show that some individuals understand physical characteristics of
tornadoes very differently than experts do. In addition, mobile home
residents may also hold views that differ from experts about the ability
of their homes to withstand tornadic winds and debris. Even if mobile
home occupants pay close attention to thunderstorm hazards and might be
willing to evacuate, they may prioritize protective actions for
lightning or flash flooding over those recommended for tornadoes.
Finally, the interviews reveal that there is much confusion over where
to go, when to leave, and which route to take to arrive safely at a
sheltering place for tornado hazards. I discuss some of the potential
ramifications of the findings for theory and practice and suggest how
future research might build on this work.

AB  - Extreme weather events are common and increasing in intensity in the
southwestern Pacific region. Health impacts from cyclones and tropical
storms cause acute injuries and infectious disease outbreaks. Defining
population vulnerability to extreme weather events by examining a recent
flood in Honiara, Solomon Islands, can help stakeholders and
policymakers adapt development to reduce future threats. The acute and
subacute health impacts following the April 2014 floods were defined
using data obtained from hospitals and clinics, the Ministry of Health
and in-country World Health Organization office in Honiara. Geographical
information system (GIS) was used to assess morbidity and mortality, and
vulnerability of the health system infrastructure and households in
Honiara. The April flash floods were responsible for 21 acute deaths, 33
injuries, and a diarrhea outbreak that affected 8,584 people with 10
pediatric deaths. A GIS vulnerability assessment of the location of the
health system infrastructure and households relative to rivers and the
coastline identified 75% of the health infrastructure and over 29% of
Honiara's population as vulnerable to future hydrological events.
Honiara, Solomon Islands, is a rapidly growing, highly vulnerable urban
Pacific Island environment. Evaluation of the mortality and morbidity
from the April 2014 floods as well as the infectious disease outbreaks
that followed allows public health specialists and policy makers to
understand the health system and populations vulnerability to future
shocks. Understanding the negative impacts natural disaster have on
people living in urban Pacific environments will help the government as
well as development partners in crafting resilient adaptation
development.

AB  - In the framework of flood risk assessment, while the understanding of
hazard and exposure has significantly improved over the last years,
knowledge on vulnerability remains one of the challenges. Current
approaches in vulnerability research are characterised by a division
between social scientists and natural scientists. In order to close this
gap, we present an approach that combines information on physical and
social vulnerability in order to merge information on the susceptibility
of elements at risk and society. With respect to physical vulnerability,
the study is based on local-scale vulnerability models using nonlinear
regression approaches. Modified Weibull distributions were fit to the
data in order to represent the relationship between process magnitude
and degree of loss. With respect to social vulnerability we conducted a
door-to-door survey which resulted in particular insights on flood risk
awareness and resilience strategies of exposed communities. In general,
both physical and social vulnerability were low in comparison with other
European studies, which may result from (a) specific building
regulations in the four Mediterranean test sites as well as general
design principles leading to low structural susceptibility of elements
at risk, and (b) relatively low social vulnerability of citizens
exposed. As a result it is shown that a combination of different
perspectives of vulnerability will lead to a better understanding of
exposure and capacities in flood risk management.

PD  - 
AB  - We report findings from a mixed method study of women's gendered
experiences with flash floods in the coastal city of Lagos, Nigeria.
Drawing on narrative accounts from 36 interviews, a survey (n = 453) and
6 focus group discussions, we investigate the impacts of floods in
general and specifically the July 2011 flood event on women's lives,
livelihoods, and health. We draw on complementary perspectives from
feminist political ecology and social vulnerability theory to understand
the ways in which such events are perceived, experienced and managed by
women of different socio-economic classes, households, and geographic
locations. Thematic and content analyses were used to examine women's
perceptions of floods, while descriptive statistical analysis and
chi-square test were employed to compare actual impacts. Results show
that women in general expressed no concern about gendered vulnerability
to flooding as most believed flood impacts were gender neutral. This
dominant view however, was not supported by evidence in the post-July
2011 flooding as impacts varied among income groups and neighbourhoods,
and gender differences were apparent. Women in the low-income
neighbourhood recorded higher impacts and slower recovery compared to
other social categories of women and men. All impacts reported were
statistically significant between women in low and high income
neighbourhoods but most were not significant between women in middle and
high income neighbourhoods. Gender relations and roles intersecting with
place, class, employment status, and healthcare, were mediating factors
that placed low-income women at greater risk of impacts than others.
With climate change likely to induce more extreme events, a case is made
for collaborative and institutional efforts to systematically boost
urban poor women's adaptive capacity through targeted programmes aimed
at alleviating poverty and improving women's access to housing, health
care and alternative sources of livelihoods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB  - In Himalayan region, it is very important to generate detailed terrain
information for identifying the causes of natural hazards such as debris
flows, debris floods, and flash floods, so that appropriate corrective
measures are initiated for reducing the risk of the people and property
to these disasters. Basic watershed morphometrics coupled with the
land-cover and slope information are useful for assessing the hazard
vulnerability. The terrain characteristics govern the surface hydrology
and have profound influence on the incidence and magnitude of natural
hazards, particularly floods. The present work is a comparative study of
two watersheds of Jhelum basin (upper Indus basin in Kashmir). In this
research, we make an integrated use of the Linear Imaging Self-Scanner
satellite data and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
Radiometer digital elevation model, supported with extensive field
information, in a GIS environment for assessing the surface hydrological
behavior of Lidder and Rembiara watersheds of the Jhelum basin.
Knowledge-driven modelling approach has been used to evaluate the runoff
potential of the watersheds to assess the flood vulnerability
downstream. The results revealed that Lidder watershed exhibits lesser
basin lag time compared to Rembiara watershed for a storm event.
Further, due to higher population density in the Lidder downstream, this
watershed is also socially more vulnerable to flooding than Rembiara.
The methodology and results of this study shall help in formulating
better flood mitigation strategies in this part of the Himalayan region,
where the observation network of hydrometeorological and other land
surface parameters is either missing or very scanty.

influenced in the last period by the worldwide climate changes: extreme
weather conditions (high temperatures and prolonged dryness, rainfall
accompanied by storm) what have as effects: increasing the risk of
desertification, floods, forest fires, erosion, landslides, flash
floods, snow squall etc. As precipitation effects have resulted leakage
liquid and solid, in particular on slopes without forests, which led to
the submission of material eroded in river beds. Concentrating leaks
have resulted in an increase in flows of the volume and speed both water

erosion processes. Floods have been accompanied by intense processes of
erosion of the banks causing subsidences or land slides. The other
vessel types were excessive transport have clogged hydrological

AB  - In this chapter, the notion of flood risk is interpreted and factors
influencing flood risk: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability are
examined. A holistic perspective on changing flood risk is provided.
Economic losses from floods have greatly increased over last decades,
principally driven by the growing exposure of assets at risk. It has not
been found possible to attribute observed rain-generated peak streamflow
trends to anthropogenic climate change, generally. Based on physical
reasoning, increases in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall
should contribute to increase in risk of precipitation-generated local
flooding (e.g., flash flooding and urban flooding) in many areas.

AB  - Understanding the physical vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure
to natural hazards is an essential step in risk assessment for large
cities. We have interpreted high spatial resolution images, conducted
field surveys, and utilized numerical simulations, in order to assess
vulnerability across Arequipa, south Peru, close to the active El Misti
volcano. The emphasis of this study was on flash floods and volcanic or
non-volcanic hyperconcentrated flows, which recur on average every 3.5
years across the city. We utilized a geographic information system to
embed vulnerability and hazard maps as a step to calculate risk for
buildings and bridges along the Rio Chili valley and two tributaries. A
survey of similar to 1,000 buildings from 46 city blocks, different in
age, construction materials, and land usage, provided architectural and
structural characteristics. A similar survey of twenty bridges across
the three valleys was based on structural, hydraulic, and strategic
parameters. Interpretation of high spatial resolution (HSR) satellite
images, which allows for quick identification of approximately 69 % of
the structural building types, effectively supplemented field data
collection. Mapping vulnerability has led us to pinpoint strategic areas
in case of future destructive floods or flows. Calculated vulnerability
is high if we examine structural criteria alone. We further consider
physical setting with the most vulnerable city blocks located on the
lowermost terraces, perpendicular or oblique to the flow path.
Statistical analysis conducted on 3,015 city blocks, considering nine
criteria identified from HSR images, indicated that building-type
heterogeneity and the shape of the city blocks, along with building and
street network density, are the most discriminant parameters for
assessing vulnerability.

AB  - The 2015 Gorkha earthquake caused severe damage to structures in central
Nepal. In 2017, a flash flood event occurred in the same area affected
by the Gorkha earthquake and aggravated the damage to structures and
lifelines. The present paper reports the damage of structures and
lifelines subjected to multi-hazards in the affected area in central
Nepal. Field investigations were performed after the Gorkha earthquake
as well as the 2017 Chhatiune Khola flash flood. Specifically, damage
associated with bridges, vernacular stone masonry buildings, roads,
water supply systems, irrigation canals, electric poles, and road signs
was assessed. Field measurement in terms of flow height was recorded in
the case of vernacular buildings, and depth-damage curve due to the
flash flood is depicted in this study. We have outlined the
multi-hazards vulnerability of vernacular stone masonry buildings along
the river banks susceptible to flash floods in this study. Moreover, a
quantified damage scenario due to a strong earthquake and a flash flood
is highlighted using field records.

AB  - Arequipa, the second largest city in Peru, is exposed to many natural
hazards, most notably earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides,
lahars (volcanic debris flows), and flash floods. Of these, lahars and
flash floods, triggered by occasional torrential rainfall, pose the most
frequently occurring hazards that can affect the city and its environs,
in particular the areas containing low-income neighbourhoods. This paper
presents and discusses criteria for delineating areas prone to flash
flood and lahar hazards, which are localized along the usually dry
(except for the rainy season) ravines and channels of the Rio Chili and
its tributaries that dissect the city. Our risk-evaluation study is
based mostly on field surveys and mapping, but we also took into account
quality and structural integrity of buildings, available socioeconomic
data, and information gained from interviews with risk-managers
officials.
In our evaluation of the vulnerability of various parts of the city, in
addition to geological and physical parameters, we also took into
account selected socio-economic parameters, such as the educational and
poverty level of the population, unemployment figures, and population
density. In addition, we utilized a criterion of the ``isolation
factor{''}, based on distances to access emergency resources (hospitals,
shelters or safety areas, and water) in each city block. By combining
the hazard, vulnerability and exposure criteria, we produced detailed
risk-zone maps at the city-block scale, covering the whole city of
Arequipa and adjacent suburbs. Not surprisingly, these maps show that
the areas at high risk coincide with blocks or districts with
populations at low socioeconomic levels. Inhabitants at greatest risk
are the poor recent immigrants from rural areas who live in unauthorized
settlements in the outskirts of the city in the upper parts of the
valleys. Such settlements are highly exposed to natural hazards and have
little access to vital resources.
Our study provides good rationale for the risk zoning of the city, which
in turn may be used as an educational tool for better understanding the
potential effects of natural hazards and the exposure of the population
residing in and around Arequipa. We hope that our work and the
risk-zonation maps will provide the impetus and basis for
risk-management authorities of the Municipality and the regional
government of Arequipa to enforce existing regulations in building in
hazardous zones and to adopt an effective long-term strategy to reduce
risks from lahar, flash flood, and other natural hazards.

AB  - The paper assesses the damage caused by 2010 flash flood and its
underlying causes in the upper zone of Panjkora River within district
Dir Upper, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province in Pakistan. Floods in
general and flash floods in particular are very common in the area, and
the phenomenon has intensified in the wake of observed climatic changes
in the region. Anticipating an increase in the multiplicity of causes
and a rise in the human, livelihood, and property losses attributed to
flash floods calls for a detailed study of affected communities in the
region. Within the study area of District Dir Upper-within the band of
200 m on both sides of Panjkora River, three most affected communities,
namely Barikot, Kalkot, and Sharingal, were picked on random basis to
have detailed analysis of underlying causes and the quantification of
damage assessment in the area. Questionnaire-based household survey and
structured interviews were conducted to investigate physical and
economic damages in the sample sites. Global positioning system (GPS)
survey is also conducted to acquire absolute location of damages, and
geographic information system is used to visualize land use, land cover,
physical features, and GPS data. Monsoon winds interacted with the
westerlies abnormally caused unprecedented high intensity rainfall in
the valley. The steep topography of the area caused rainwater to
accumulate rapidly in the Panjkora River channel, overpowering the
withholding capacity of the river. The flash flood inflected heavy
losses to life and properties of the local population. The
infrastructure such as houses, roads, retaining walls, bridges, water
supply schemes, and irrigation channels were destroyed severely in the
whole area particularly in Kalkot. Three explored underlying causes of
flash floods and the degree of damage due to 2010 flash floods in the
region call for an enhanced realization for climatic change
adaptability, flood risk management, and mitigation measures, better
flood response through early warning systems, and improved
rehabilitation and recovery efforts within flood prone areas such as
district Dir Upper, KP, Pakistan.

Y1  - 2003///
PD  - 
AB  - A GIS-based regional reconnaissance-level assessment of landslide risk
to the Cairns community has been carried out to provide information to
the Cairns City Council for planning and emergency management purposes.
Magnitude recurrence relations were tentatively established for the two
main slope processes: landslides on the hill slopes; and large debris
flows extending out from the gully systems on to the plains. From the
recurrence relations, landslide hazard (H) was estimated as the annual
probability of a point being impacted by a landslide. The nature, number
(E) and geographic distribution of the elements at risk were obtained by
interrogating the GIS, and their vulnerabilities (V) to destruction by
the two main landslide slope processes were assessed. From this
information, specific risk (= H x V) and total risk (= H x V x E) maps
were produced.
Although total landslide risk is relatively low at present, it will
increase as development extends further into the hill slopes, unless
adequate mitigation measures are taken. Large debris flows, while
considerably less frequent than landslides on cut slopes, could impact
on subdivisions at the base of the slopes. Blockage by landslides of
roads and railways providing access to Cairns can cause isolation of the
community. Flash flooding in Freshwater Creek, or debris flows, have the
potential to disrupt the Cairns water supply by blocking the intake or
destroying sections of the pipeline.

growing vulnerability in the context of geopolitical and global changes,
existing systems of natural hazard management must be reviewed on a
regular basis. This is illustrated well by Bavaria's recent history. The
lessons from the big floods in the period of 1999-2013 led to a
fundamental modification of Bavaria's integral flood protection
strategy. The concepts of flood risk management, resilience and dealing
with extreme flood events which exceed standard structural design limits
came to the fore. Management of flash floods and other floods, handling
of potential retention areas, the inclusion of insurance, resettlement,
and the burden of maintenance are further challenges which are briefly
addressed in this paper.

A1  - Kron, Wolfgang
Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Various disasters in recent decades have confirmed that the risk from
water-related events has been increasing significantly worldwide. Among
those events are tsunamis, storm surges, river floods, flash floods,
mass movements and droughts. The driving factors of this risk are the
unabated increase in global population, the concentration of people in
high-risk areas such as coasts, flood plains and hillsides, the rise in
vulnerability of assets, infrastructure and social systems, and the
consequences of environmental and climatic changes. Risk reduction
requires general awareness at all levels of society and a partnership
between the public sector, the people concerned and the insurance
industry. Structural and nonstructural precautionary measures are always
cheaper in the long run than paying losses. Overall economic
consequences are significantly less severe in societies with a high
insurance penetration.

AB  - During the planning of urban environment, usually economic and social
parameters are taken into consideration. As a result, urban planning
areas are susceptible and vulnerable to different types of natural
disasters, which cause extensive damages to these areas. In the current
study, for the protection of the urban environment, a unique approach of
urban planning and sustainable development is proposed. The study area
is the Wadi Al-Aska basin (East of Jeddah City), Saudi Arabia. Before
the suitability analysis, urban development in the Jeddah area from 1973
to 2009 was applied. In the current study, an integrated evaluation of
the suitable areas for urban development is proposed by using
geological, geomorphological, and geographical characteristics of the
study area as well as flash flood hazard factor. The used parameters
were correlated by using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP)
method and incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS) in
order to produce the corresponding suitability maps. The study area is
classified into five categories including very high, high, moderate,
low, and very low suitability for urban development. These can be
attributed mainly to the fact that in the majority of cases, only
geographical, social, and economical factors were used for urban
development, whereas in the current study, geomorphological,
geographical, geological, and natural hazards parameters were quantified
and taken into account.

AB  - This study investigates flash flood forecast and warning communication,
interpretation, and decision making, using data from a survey of 418
members of the public in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Respondents to the
public survey varied in their perceptions and understandings of flash
flood risks in Boulder, and some had misconceptions about flash flood
risks, such as the safety of crossing fast-flowing water. About 6% of
respondents indicated consistent reversals of US watch-warning alert
terminology. However, more in-depth analysis illustrates the
multi-dimensional, situationally dependent meanings of flash flood
alerts, as well as the importance of evaluating interpretation and use
of warning information along with alert terminology. Some public
respondents estimated low likelihoods of flash flooding given a flash
flood warning; these were associated with lower anticipated likelihood
of taking protective action given a warning. Protective action
intentions were also lower among respondents who had less trust in flash
flood warnings, those who had not made prior preparations for flash
flooding, and those who believed themselves to be safer from flash
flooding. Additional analysis, using open-ended survey questions about
responses to warnings, elucidates the complex, contextual nature of
protective decision making during flash flood threats. These findings
suggest that warnings can play an important role not only by notifying
people that there is a threat and helping motivate people to take
protective action, but also by helping people evaluate what actions to
take given their situation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

of the cities in Iran have developed in such environments, and are
facing flash and urban floods because of the rapid growth of the cities,
and the deficiency of urban planning in the last four decades. The

drainage patterns and their immediate result, namely the increase of
vulnerability of the metropolitan city of Mashhad. Mashhad, as the
second religious metropolis of the world, and second metropolis of Iran
has an annual 12 million pilgrims, and 3 million population. The results
of this study indicate that the rapid growth of the city from 1966 to
2002 has had excessive destructive effects on the catchments area, and
has caused the decrease of impervious surfaces, and the increase peak
discharge of the urban floods.

AB  - Small hillside reservoirs are fundamental for the sustainability of the
water resources in the semi-arid region of Tunisia, where the government
has constructed small dams since 1990. However, flash floods and severe
erosion are jeopardizing the life of those small hydraulic structures
prompting an assessment of the vulnerability of semi-arid catchments to
erosion. In this study, we investigated the degree of erosion in 23
catchments by considering six variables related to erosion: the specific
sediment yield, the hypsometric integral, the topographic index, the
rainfall-related attribute as well as lithological and vegetation cover.
More importance was assigned to the hypsometric integral and how it
controls erosion vulnerability. The Self-Organizing Map of Kohonen, a
robust clustering method, was implemented to analyze the patterns of the
six variables. The results revealed four groups of catchments with
different vulnerabilities to erosion. In addition, there is a global
trend of increasing erosion risk from the Southwest to the Northeast of
the semi-arid region of Tunisia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB  - Transport resilience is an important area of research in the global
effort to adapt to climate change. This paper introduces and applies a
stochastic modeling methodology to assess the impact of multihazard
events. Most cities are exposed to multiple types of extreme events,
sometimes simultaneously, and focusing on single events may lead to
inadequate design recommendations. By assigning failure probabilities of
road segments and by estimating road failure through Monte Carlo
simulation, roads and areas that are particularly vulnerable to
multihazard events can be detected. The performance of the large-scale
road network of the Tokai region in Japan (prone to both typhoons and
earthquakes) is analyzed by considering three scenarios of hazards:
flash flood, earthquake, and the combination of both hazards. The model
considers two key traffic performance characteristics: postdisaster
reduced road capacity and hourly variations in travel demand. Overall,
several areas in the region are found to be currently severely at risk,
thus providing direct information that can help authorities test the
effectiveness of future road infrastructure projects. (c) 2017 American

AB  - This paper offers a novel methodological approach for better
understanding how different capital assets can be organized,
transformed, and used in different combinations to reduce livelihood
sensitivity to climatic stresses - an area that requires greater
research attention in the context of adaptation policy. Research was
conducted in the northeastern floodplain communities of Bangladesh,
regarded as one of the most climate sensitive, resource poor, and highly
understudied areas of the country. This wetland-dominated ecosystem is
home to diverse resources user groups (e.g., farmer and fisher) who are
subjected to regular seasonal flooding, excessive rainfall, drought, and
flash floods. Working in 12 adjacent villages of two significant
wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), qualitative and quantitative
data were collected through 15 focus groups (n = 15), 35 key informant
interviews, and 356 household surveys to better understand how community
members adapt in response to their livelihood sensitivity to the
climatic stresses. Results indicate that community members organize and
transform capital assets in diverse ways to escape climate-induced
``poverty traps{''}. Findings also reveal that interventions from
external agencies (e.g., government, non-governmental organizations and
market institutions) are an important key to livelihood sustainability
for many households.

PD  - 
AB  - High-magnitude, low-frequency rain events (heavy rains) have increased
on the island of Madeira in recent years. The levadas, a built heritage
of water canals, and one of the biggest tourist attractions on the
island due to their role as hiking trails, have been repeatedly damaged
as a result of heavy rains causing problems that affect stakeholders,
regional governments and local communities. Using ethnographic methods
this study analyses the relations between tourism, actors and climate
change and especially the vulnerability of tourism spaces (hiking
trails) as a result of increased risk and (in)security.

AB  - Flash floods that occurred in the urban part of Attica, Greece, in the
last decades, have caused, overall, serious property and infrastructure
damages, economic and social activities impediment and, occasionally,
human fatalities. This paper investigates the relationship between the
rainfall hazard and the induced impact, as measured by impact
indicators, and examines the effect of the social factor on the
vulnerability of the system exposed to the flash flood risk. The study
focuses on the catastrophic flash flood event that affected Attica on
October 22, 2015. The methodology includes the analysis of the
spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and citizens' calls to the Fire
Service emergency for help during the event, as well as the analysis of
people's responses at an on-line behavioral survey. Results feature the
roles of the rainfall hazard and of the society on the flash flood
impact and contribute to a more integrated view of the flash flood risk
in an urbanized environment.

flood, earthquakes, workplace accident, fault in aircraft industry,
seismic vulnerability, disaster mitigation and management, and early
fault detection in nuclear industry have been studied. This paper looked
at those cases, and their results showed nearly 60% uses artificial

AB  - The increase in intensity of torrential rains of Romania over the last
decades, as a consequence of the general tendency of global warming, has
triggered many flash-floods especially in small and very small river
basins which in turn have generated a lot of damages, from loss of human
lives to important material prejudices. The paper focuses on determining
the vulnerability degree of small river basins from Some river basin
regarding flash-floods in general and is composed primarily of two
parts: in the first part we have presented one of the most destructive
flash floods that took place in Some river basin, on the 20-21 June

PD  - 
AB  - Widespread poverty is the most serious threat and social problem that
Bangladesh faces. Regional vulnerability to climate change threatens to
escalate the magnitude of poverty. It is essential that poverty
projections be estimated while bearing in mind the effects of climate
change. The main purpose of this paper is to perform an agrarian
sub-national regional analysis of climate change vulnerability in
Bangladesh under various climate change scenarios and evaluate its
potential impact on poverty. This study is relevant to socio-economic
research on climate change vulnerability and agriculture risk management
and has the potential to contribute new insights to the complex
interactions between household income and climate change risks to
agricultural communities in Bangladesh and South Asia. This study uses
analysis of variance, cluster analysis, decomposition of variance and
log-normal distribution to estimate the parameters of income variability
that can be used to ascertain vulnerability levels and help us to
understand the poverty levels that climate change could potentially
generate. It is found that the levels and sources of income vary greatly
among regions of Bangladesh. The variance decomposition of income showed
that agricultural income in Mymensingh and Rangpur is the main cause of
the total income difference among all sources of income. Moreover, a
large variance in agricultural income among regions is induced by the
gross income from rice production. Additionally, even in the long run
the gradual, constant reduction of rice yield due to climate change in
Bangladesh is not a severe problem for farmers. However, extreme events
such as floods, flash floods, droughts, sea level rise and greenhouse
gas emissions, based on Representative concentration pathways (RCPs),
could increase the poverty rates in Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Barisal and
Khulnaregions that would be greatly affected by unexpected yield losses
due to extreme climatic events. Therefore, research into and development
of adaptation measures to climate change in regions where farmers are
largely dependent on agricultural income are important.

T1  - Assessing risks from climate variability and change for disaster-prone zones in Bangladesh

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - We have measured livelihoods vulnerability indices for four disaster
prone zones in Bangladesh, namely saline, flood, flash flood and
drought. A total of 2558 households were surveyed to collect data on
socio-demographics, livelihoods, social networks, health, food and water
security, natural disasters and climate variability. The data were
aggregated using a composite index and vulnerabilities across the four
disaster prone areas were compared. Our results show that the flash
flood zone is the most vulnerable zone followed by the saline, drought
and flood zones respectively. The flash flood zone is mainly a mono-rice
crop area and local livelihood opportunities are uncertain and limited.
Road infrastructure is poor as a large part of this zone remains under
water in the wet season. Public health services are underprovided and
the hospitals are understaffed, sanitary conditions are poor and the
households suffer a longer period of food insecurity. The poor
households living in the saline zone have to depend more on social
networks and local authorities to withstand livelihood shocks brought
about by natural disasters such as tidal surges, cyclones and increasing
salinity. The drought and saline zones are highly vulnerable to water.
Water in these zones is not only scarce but also unsafe for drinking.
The saline zone also suffers from salinity in water used for irrigation
which has already affected productivity of land. We suggest an increase
in public spending on sanitation and drinking water, health and rural
infrastructure particularly in the disaster prone areas where incidence
of poverty is high. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PD  - 
AB  - Given that floods continue to cause yearly significant worldwide human
and material damages, flood risk mitigation is a key issue and a
permanent challenge in developing policies and strategies at various
spatial scales. Therefore, a basic phase is elaborating hazard and flood
risk maps, documents which are an essential support for flood risk
management. The aim of this paper is to develop an approach that allows
for the identification of flash-flood and flood-prone susceptible areas
based on computing and mapping of two indices: FFPI (Flash-Flood
Potential Index) and FPI (Flooding Potential Index). These indices are
obtained by integrating in a GIS environment several geographical
variables which control runoff (in the case of the FFPI) and favour
flooding (in the case of the FPI). The methodology was applied in the
upper (mountainous) and middle (hilly) catchment of the Prahova River, a
densely populated and socioeconomically well-developed area which has
been affected repeatedly by water-related hazards over the past decades.
The resulting maps showing the spatialization of the FFPI and FPI allow
for the identification of areas with high susceptibility to flash-floods
and flooding. This approach can provide useful mapped information,
especially for areas (generally large) where there are no flood/hazard
risk maps. Moreover, the FFPI and FPI maps can constitute a preliminary
step for flood risk and vulnerability assessment.

AB  - Recent and historic high-impact events have demonstrated the flood risks
faced by exposed coastal areas. These risks will increase due to climate
change and economic development. This requires a re-evaluation of
coastal disaster risk reduction DRR strategies and prevention,
mitigation and preparedness PMP measures. To this end, the UN Office for
Disaster Risk Reduction formulated the Hyogo Framework for Action, and
the EU has issued the Floods Directive. By their nature, neither is
specific about the methods to be used to assess coastal risks,
particularly those risks resulting from dune and structure overtopping,
the non-stationarity of surge and flash flood events, and coastal
morphodynamic response. This paper describes a set of open-source and
open-access methods, tools and management approaches to fill this gap. A
Coastal Risk Assessment Framework will assess coastal risk at a regional
scale. Thus critical hotspots can be identified for which an
impact-oriented Early Warning System/Decision Support System is
developed. This can be applied in dual mode: as a forecast and warning
system and as an ex-ante planning tool to evaluate the vulnerability.
The tools are demonstrated on case study sites on a range of EU coasts
with diverse geomorphic settings, land use, forcing, hazard types and
socio-economic, cultural and environmental characteristics. Specific DRR
plans will be developed for all sites. A management guide of PMP
measures and management approaches is to be developed. The toolkit will
benefit forecasting and civil protection agencies, coastal managers,
local government, community members, NGOs, the general public and
scientists.

PD  - 
AB  - Floods are natural disasters with significant socio-economic
consequences. Urban areas with uncontrolled urban development, rapid
population growth, an unregulated municipal system and an unplanned
change of land use belong to the highly sensitive areas where floods
cause devastating economic and social losses. The aim of this paper is
to present a reliable GIS multi-criteria methodology for hazard zones'
mapping of flood-prone areas in urban areas. The proposed methodology is
based on the combined application of geographical information systems
(GIS) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The methodology
considers six factors that are relevant to the hazard of flooding in
urban areas: the height, slope, distance to the sewage network, the
distance from the water surface, the water table and land use. The
expert evaluation takes into account the nature and severity of observed
criteria, and it is tested using three scenarios: the modalities of the
analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The first of them uses a new approach
to the exploitation of uncertainty in the application of the AHP
technique, the interval rough numbers (IR'AHP). The second one uses the
fuzzy technique for the exploitation of uncertainty with the AHP method
(F'AHP), and the third scenario contemplates the use of the traditional
(crisp) AHP method. The proposed methodology is demonstrated in Palilula
Municipality, Belgrade, Serbia. In the last few decades, Palilula
Municipality has been repeatedly devastated by extreme flood events.
These floods severely affected the transportation networks and other
infrastructure. Historical flood inundation data have been used in the
validation process. The final urban flood hazard map proves a
satisfactory agreement between the flood hazard zones and the spatial
distribution of historical floods that happened in the last 58 years.
The results indicate that the scenario in which the IR'AHP methodology
is used provides the highest level of compatibility with historical data
on floods. The produced map showed that the areas of very high flood
hazard are located on the left Danube River bank. These areas are
characterized by lowland morphology, gentle slope, sewage network,
expansion of impermeable locations and intense urbanization. The
proposed GIS-IR'AHP methodology and the results of this study provide a
good basis for developing a system of flood hazard management in urban
areas and can be successfully used for spatial city development policy.

summer and autumn in China's coastal regions. Gales and rainstorms
brought by typhoon can directly cause serious loss in economy and also
induce storm surge, flash flood, mud-rock flow, landslide and other
secondary disasters. This article studies the impact of collapsing force
of typhoon gale and the risk-based warning of typhoon rainstorm. By
calculating the accumulated wind pressure and the designed wind load of
bearing walls of low-rise building in coastal region, we define the
damaged building index. In addition, four steps for the risk-based
warning or impact forecasting for small and medium-sized river basins,
flash flood, mud flows and landslides caused by Typhoon rainstorm are
introduced, which include understanding vulnerability of disaster
carriers, developing risk thresholds of disasters, improving the
accuracy of QPE/QPF and the risk assessment skill.

AB  - Economic losses caused by flash floods are expected to rise worldwide in
the coming decades, which is largely due to the increasing exposure of
elements at risk. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the economic
context of the potentially affected areas is highly recommendable.
Numerous papers have been published to date that focus on quantifying
vulnerability in general and in areas affected by floods in particular.
However, the number of studies devoted to flash flood-prone areas is far
lower. Integrated economic vulnerability assessment enables one to learn
what characteristics explain, trigger, intensify, and attenuate the
exposure, sensitivity, and resilience of economically vulnerable
populations, which can be combined to achieve an Integrated Economic
Vulnerability Index (IEVI). The methodology deployed here was conducted
in Castilla y Leon (northwest Spain; 94.223 km(2)) and has allowed the
economic vulnerability of urban areas to be analyzed, which has been
primarily addressed by the estimation of economic losses or, more
recently, including a few economic variables within social vulnerability
assessments. Thus, 118 economic variables were initially gathered and
then divided into groups through a hierarchical segmentation analysis.
Subsequently, variables were combined employing a principal components
analysis, giving rise to the economic vulnerability factors that were
subsequently aggregated to construct the IEVI. Tolerance statistic was
used as a weighting method to define the IEVI, whereas quintiles were
chosen as a statistical criterion to map economic vulnerability. As a
final step, latent class cluster analysis was implemented to identify
spatial patterns of vulnerability. Our findings show that IEVI scores
have a high spatial variability and a high degree of complexity in the
relationships among different vulnerability factors. Moreover, they help
to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability, which makes the design of
suitable vulnerability reduction strategies possible, thereby improving
the efficiency of flood risk management plans and policies.

contiguous United States from 1959 to 2005. Assembled data include the
location of fatalities, age and gender of victims, activity and/or
setting of fatalities, and the type of flood events responsible for each
fatality report. Because of uncertainties in the number of flood deaths
in Louisiana from Hurricane Katrina, these data are not included in the
study. Analysis of these data reveals that a majority of fatalities are
caused by flash floods. People between the ages of 10 and 29 and > 60 yr
of age are found to be more vulnerable to floods. Findings reveal that
human behavior contributes to flood fatality occurrences. These results
also suggest that future structural modifications of flood control
designs (e. g., culverts and bridges) may not reduce the number of
fatalities nationwide. Spatially, flood fatalities are distributed
across the United States, with high-fatality regions observed along the
northeast Interstate-95 corridor, the Ohio River valley, and near the
Balcones Escarpment in south-central Texas. The unique distributions
found are likely driven by both physical vulnerabilities for flooding as
well as the social vulnerabilities.

AB  - Climate change is a process which is global in nature, but which has
direct consequences at regional and local levels. Coastal areas as a
whole, and small coastal river basins across the Baltic Sea in
particular, are especially vulnerable since they directly suffer the
influences of phenomena such as heavy precipitation and flash floods,
the frequency of which has been increasing over the last few years, as
well as rising sea levels. This paper describes the framework of the
process of adaptation to climate change in small coastal river basins,
based on a case study from the city of Klaipeda in Lithuania. In
particular, the paper outlines the degree of vulnerability of coastal

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Most road-stream crossings over ephemeral channels are vulnerable to
extreme hydrologic events. Ford stream crossings (FSCs) are usually
dangerous for the road traffic during periods of high flow, in
particular under flash flood conditions. The present paper analyzes the
flood hazards on the Mediterranean coast in the Region of Murcia
(south-east Spain), affecting this type of road-stream crossing over dry
channels, according to hydraulic variables and bedload transport rates
estimated for discharges at bankfull and flood-prone stages. Under such
conditions, the safety of people and vehicles was obtained using
numerical models, developed by previous researchers; in particular,
water levels and flow velocities across ford reaches were compared with
different trend curves between water depths and corresponding critical
velocities for children and adults, and for various prototype vehicles.
Specifically, two approaches to assess this type of hazards were
proposed: a specific Hydraulic Hazard Index and an algorithm for
estimating the flood hazard from criteria of bed stability and bedload
transport capacity (Flood Hazard at Fords, FHF). In addition, different
exposure levels were established, using a Flood Vulnerability Index,
based on the FHF, the road category, and the annual average daily
traffic. The FHF model gave the best results with regard to the
magnitude of the damage observed in recent flash floods for flow stages
similar to those simulated. According to the danger thresholds
established for this index, half-bankfull flows represent here a high
risk: 27.3% of FSCs for mini-cars and 18.2% for large cars. At
bankfull, the FHF exhibits very high values for mini-cars (77.3% of
FSCs) and for large passenger vehicles (50% of FSCs), while at the
floodprone stage, extreme FHF values are reached for all kinds of
vehicles at most of the ford crossings.

PD  - 
AB  - Climate change will impact urban infrastructure networks by changing
precipitation patterns in a region. This study presents a novel
vulnerability assessment framework for infrastructure networks against
extreme rainfall-induced flash floods, with a specific application to
transportation. The framework combines climate models, network science,
geographical information systems (GIS), and stochastic modeling to
compile a vulnerability surface (VS). Daily precipitation simulations
for 2006-2100 from the Community Climate System Model, version 4
(CCSM4), are used to produce a stochastic simulation of extreme flash
flood events in five U.S. cities-that is, Boston, Massachusetts;
Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-under two different climate scenarios (RCP4.5
and RCP8.5). To assess the impact of these events, percentage drops in
static (i.e., overall properties and robustness topological indicators)
and dynamic (i.e., GIS accessibility and travel demand metrics) network
properties are measured before and after simulated extreme events. The
results of these metrics are inputs on a radar diagram to form a VS.
Overall, the results show that changes in flash flood frequency due to
climate change can have a significant impact on road networks, as was
demonstrated recently in Houston, Texas. The magnitude of these impacts
is chiefly associated with the geographic location of the cities and the
size of the networks. The proposed framework can be reproduced in any
city around the world, and researchers can use the results as guidelines
for infrastructure design and planning purposes. Moreover, sensitivity
analysis to varying greenhouse gas concentration trajectories can help
local and national authorities to prioritize strategies for adaptation
to climate change in more vulnerable regions.

T1  - The occurrence of floods and the role of climate variations from 1880 in Calabria (Southern Italy)

Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - In this paper, we present a methodological approach based on a
comparative analysis of floods that occurred in a wide region over a
long period and the climatic data characterising the same period,
focusing on the climate trend. The method simplifies the comparative
analysis of several time series by defining some indexes (e.g. the
monthly, bi-monthly, and ... m-monthly indexes of precipitation,
temperature, wet days and precipitation intensity and the monthly flood
number) that can be used to study phenomena such as floods that are
characterised by spatial and temporal variability. The analysis was used
to investigate the potential effect of climate variation on the damaging
floods trend.
The approach was tested for the Calabria region (Italy) using historical
flood and climatic data from 1880 to 2007. The results showed that the
number of floods was correlated with the monthly indexes of
precipitation, wet days, and daily precipitation intensity. The
following trends were recognised: decreasing precipitation and wet days,
almost constant precipitation intensity, increasing temperature, and
linearly increasing floods. A second-order polynomial trend analysis
showed a slight decrease in floods since the seventies, which might be
explained by the favourable climatic conditions during the period and/or
the effect of increasing awareness of flood vulnerability.

T1  - RISK ANALYSIS: MAJOR FLASH FLOODS IN THE UPPER RIVER BASIN OF MURES. STANCENI
A1  - Goron, Nicoleta Daniela
Y1  - 2011///
PD  - 
AB  - The present study focuses on the impact generated by flash floods within
the mountain area of the Mures hydrographic basin, namely by analyzing
the data offered by the hydrographical station of Stanceni regarding
measurements of the hazards and the economical and environmental
aspects. Thus, the study is directed towards the representative
flash-floods that occurred during the years of 1970, 1975, 1995, 1998,
and 2005.
The comparative analysis of the hazard involves hydrograph reference
regarding the largest floods to be recorded in the years of 1970, 1975,
1995, 1998, and 2005 in the upper river basin of Mures, including the
flow rates, the volumes transported, the growth and decay duration as
well as reports to the total duration of the floods in the study.
The vulnerability of the area is influenced by the population density,
which is lower as compared to the plain area crossed by the river Mures
mainly in it's middle and lower sector, and the area's economical
development.
The effects of the major flash floods are reflected within the amount of
damage caused in the studied area.
The paper finally states the structural and non-structural measures that
have been taken in order to reduce the impact that flash-floods have
upon the upper side of the Mures river basin, within the county of
Mures.

AB  - This contribution explores the evolution of the flood risk in the
Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (MAB; Northeast Spain) from 1981 to 2015,
and how it has been affected by changes in land use, population and
precipitation. To complete this study, we analysed PRESSGAMA and
INUNGAMA databases to look for all the information related to the floods
and flash floods that have affected the chosen region. The Consorcio de
Compensacion de Seguros, a state insurance company for extraordinary
risks, provided data on economic damage. The extreme precipitation trend
was analysed by the Fabra Observatory and El Prat-Airport Observatory,
and daily precipitation data were provided by the State Meteorological
Agency of Spain (AEMET) and the Meteorological Service of Catalonia
(SMC). Population data were obtained from the Statistical Institute of
Catalonia (IDESCAT). Changes in land use were estimated from the land
use maps for Catalonia corresponding to 1956, 1993, 2000, 2005 and 2009.
Prevention measures like rainwater tanks and improvements to the
drainage system were also been considered. The specific case of
Barcelona is presented, a city recognised by United Nations
International Strategy for Disaster Reduction as a model city for urban
resilience to floods. The evolution of flood events in the MAB does not
show any significant trend for this period. We argue that the evolution
in floods can be explained, at least in part, by the lack of trend in
extreme precipitation indices, and also by the improvements in flood
prevention measures.

T1  - Distributed hydrological modeling of floods in the Cevennes-Vivarais region, France: Impact of uncertainties related to precipitation estimation and model parameterization
A1  - Navas, Rafael

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - The Cevennes-Vivarais (France) is a region prone to heavy precipitation
events and flash floods occurring mainly during the autumn season. Due
to this vulnerability, it is a well instrumented region to monitor
rainfall (4 weather radars of the French ARAMIS radar network, 200
hourly raingauges) and river discharge (45 stations). A multiscale
radar-raingauge rainfall re-analysis from 10 to 300 km(2) and 1 h time
step has been established for the period 2007-2014 by using the kriging
with external drift (KED) technique. In the present work, a
quantification of the isolated and joint impacts of precipitation and
model uncertainties in distributed rainfall-runoff simulations is
presented for 10 km(2)-1 h model resolution. For this purpose the
following methodology is implemented: (1) Development of a distributed
hydrological model based on the Curve Number and the Unit Hydrograph
concepts for the Ardeche and Gardon catchments; (2) Generation of an
ensemble of perturbed precipitation fields based on the KED error
standard deviations and the space-time structure of the residuals to the
drift. (3) Generation of so-called behavioral parameter sets for the
hydrological model based on generalized sensitive analysis (GSA) and the
use of discharge observations; (4) Implementation of the hydrological
model for gauged and ungauged catchments with the radar-raingauge
rainfall ensembles and the various parameter sets. Uncertainties in
rainfall and runoff simulations are then quantified in terms of
coefficient of variation. The main findings reveal that (i) the
precipitation uncertainty is dampened in the hydrological simulation,
especially as long as the size of the watershed increases; in the
considered context, the model uncertainty dominates the precipitation
uncertainty and it is shown to be independent on catchment size.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Floods have prevailed in the recent years, hampering not only social but
also the economic development as well. This global pandemic has caused
loss of lives, property and economic damages in many countries,
including Zimbabwe. Rainfall intensity in the country's seven main river
catchments namely; Mzingwane, Gwayi, Save (or Sabi), Mazowe (or Mazoe),
Sanyati, Manyame and Runde triggers flash floods due to high peak
discharges. It is therefore of paramount importance to try and reduce or
rather prevent these losses due to flood events. The main objective of
this study is to ascertain flood events in Zimbabwe and discuss how best
they can be managed for a sustainable future. The assessment is carried
out using AQUEDUCT Global Flood Analyzer in which all the analysis is
based on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population and the present
and future (2030) urban damage. To estimate future changes and
effectively suggest flood disaster management and mitigation strategies,
three scenarios obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change 5th Assessment Report were utilized. A 5-year flood protection
was then employed and the urban damage due to the flood events, the
population at risk and the effects of this disaster on GDP was
determined. This study outlined that in any given year, the majority of
Zimbabwe has a low to a medium that is 2-3% probability of flood
occurrence in which a 5-year flood has a 20% occurrence probability in
any given year. If there is no flood protection employed, this 5-year
flood could cause $106.3 thousand affected population, $32.4 million
urban damage and $67.9 million affected GDP. It is concluded that it is
impossible to completely eliminate flood events, however, proposed
mitigation measures, diminution approach and proper planning and
preparation before their occurrence can reduce the environmental,
economic and social losses.

Y1  - 2006///
PD  - 
AB  - Every year, flash floods cause economic losses and major problems for
undertaking daily activity in the Catalonia region (NE Spain). Sometimes
catastrophic damage and casualties occur. When a long term analysis of
floods is undertaken, a question arises regarding the changing role of
the vulnerability and the hazard in risk evolution. This paper sets out
to give some information to deal with this question, on the basis of
analysis of all the floods that have occurred in Barcelona county
(Catalonia) since the 14th century, as well as the flooded area, urban
evolution, impacts and the weather conditions for any of most severe
events. With this objective, the identification and classification of
historical floods, and characterisation of flash-floods among these,
have been undertaken. Besides this, the main meteorological factors
associated with recent flash floods in this city and neighbouring
regions are well-known. On the other hand, the identification of
rainfall trends that could explain the historical evolution of flood
hazard occurrence in this city has been analysed. Finally,
identification of the influence of urban development on the
vulnerability to floods has been carried out. Barcelona city has been
selected thanks to its long continuous data series (daily rainfall data
series, since 1854; one of the longest rainfall rate series of Europe,
since 1921) and for the accurate historical archive information that is
available (since the Roman Empire for the urban evolution). The
evolution of flood occurrence shows the existence of oscillations in the
earlier and later modern-age periods that can be attributed to climatic
variability, evolution of the perception threshold and changes in
vulnerability. A great increase of vulnerability can he assumed for the
period 1850-1900. The analysis of the time evolution for the Barcelona
rainfall series (1854-2000) shows that no trend exists, although, due to
changes in urban planning, flash-floods impact has altered over this
time. The number of catastrophic flash floods has diminished, although
the extraordinary ones have increased.

PD  - 
AB  - 5 Flash flooding is a high impact weather event that requires clear
communication regarding severity and potential hazards among
forecasters, researchers, emergency managers, and the general public.
Current standards used to communicate these characteristics include
return periods and the United States (U.S.) National Weather Service
(NWS) 4-tiered river flooding severity scale. Return periods are largely
misunderstood, and the NWS scale is limited to flooding on gauged
streams and rivers, often leaving out heavily populated urban corridors.
To address these shortcomings, a student-led group of interdisciplinary
researchers came together in a collaborative effort to develop an
impact-based Flash Flood Severity Index (FFSI). The index was proposed
as a damage-based, post-event assessment tool, and preliminary work
toward the creation of this index has been completed and presented here.
Numerous case studies were analyzed to develop the preliminary outline
for the FFSI, and three examples of such cases are included in this
paper. The scale includes five impact-based categories ranging from
Category 1 very minor flooding to Category 5 catastrophic flooding.
Along with the numerous case studies used to develop the initial outline
of the scale, empirical data in the form of semi-structured interviews
were conducted with multiple NWS forecasters across the country and
their responses were analyzed to gain more perspective on the
complicated nature of flash flood definitions and which tools were found
to be most useful. The feedback from these interviews suggests the
potential for acceptance of such an index if it can account for specific
challenges. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Flood risk assessment is an important component of risk management.
Given this context, this paper aims to identify and map areas with high
potential for flash-floods and flooding occurrence, at different spatial
scales (from catchment to local scale), in order to estimate the
flood/flooding vulnerability. The paper is based on three main methods,
which were applied in the Slnic River catchment (427 km(2)), located in
the external curvature region of the Romanian Carpathians: (i)
statistical analyses; (ii) determination and mapping of some indices to
assess the flash-flood and flooding potential (FFPI and respectively
FPI) and (iii) hydraulic modelling. The data used mainly include
hydrological statistics (maximum monthly and annual discharges,
flood-related data) and spatial data on catchment geographical
characteristics (hypsometry, geology, soils, land use) obtained or
derived from various sources (maps, aerial images, digital databases,
field measurements) which were integrated into the GIS environment. The
aforementioned methods helped to (i) highlight specificities of floods
in the Slnic catchment (magnitude, frequency, flood waves
characteristics); (ii) identify areas with high potential for
flash-floods and flooding at the catchment spatial scale; (iii) assess
the structural vulnerability in the CernteAYti village, by simulating
flood-prone areas for flood peaks with exceedance probability of 1%,
5% and 10%. The results could lead to a better knowledge and
understanding of flood characteristics in the study area, in order to
mitigate the flood risk through a more effective management, both at the
catchment scale, as well as local scale (in the Cernatesti village).

T1  - Urban stream restoration in Korea: Design considerations and residents' willingness to pay
A1  - Bae, Hyunhoe
Y1  - 2011///
PD  - 
AB  - Urban streams in Korea, which until recently were channeled and served
only flood control functions, have increasingly attracted attention for
their potential as urban parks or residential open spaces. Consequently,
urban stream restoration has been booming and a number of restoration
projects have been carried out since 1990s. However, increased flash
flood risks created by climate change are reigniting controversies
regarding the vulnerability of restored streams to flooding.
Furthermore, implementation issues including landscape/greening and
facility design considerations have been under-investigated. This study
explores these ongoing issues associated with urban stream restoration
in Korea, as well as attempts to estimate consumers' willingness to pay
for the restoration process. In particular, this study estimates the
partial values of natural and recreational attributes of urban streams,
which can be improved through various types of urban stream restoration
measures, using conjoint analysis. The findings indicate that improving
natural attributes by transforming existing concrete-encased streams
into natural state streams increases the value of an urban stream by
about 50 USD per household. Improving recreational attributes, either by
creating a walkway where there is no bank or by expanding facilities to
the existing walkway, increases the value of an urban stream by about 25
USD per household. These estimated partial values of urban stream
attributes imply the relative importance of each attribute and suggest
policy implications for priority setting and trade-offs in urban
restoration projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

PD  - 
AB  - The dominant paradigm in disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies has been
seriously contested because of its reliance on interventions based on
technocratic expertise. In the Mexican context, the influence of
informal practices such as clientelism and cartelisation of the
political system produces environmental degradation and vulnerability to
disasters within the communities in the study site. This paper
contributes to understanding of failed institutional processes and
parallel practices that intensify vulnerability to disasters by
contrasting the discourses of agents within a peri-urban community in
central Mexico. Employing the Situational Analysis Approach as a
methodological framework, the study identifies divergent views and
practices within the community, leading to different responses to
disasters and to different perceptions regarding institutional
performance. In addition, it finds that institutional decision-making,
based only on scientific and technical expertise, has resulted in
unintended consequences that influence ongoing vulnerability to floods
in the site under review.

analysis tool for modeling Qena area. Watersheds in the study area have
been identified, and geomorphology parameters and watershed
characteristics have been estimated. Different parameters, which mostly
affect the runoff, have been calculated. The HBV rainfall runoff model
has been calibrated and used to define the flash flood vulnerable areas
at the catchment. The results of flood risk classification compared well
with the estimated runoff peak discharge. GIS has proved, as expected,
to be an easy and efficient toll for watersheds flood risk assessment.

Y1  - 2009///
PD  - 
AB  - Gujarat is the third most urbanised states in India and is currently
experiencing a very high rate of economic growth. High levels of
urbanisation have made much of the urban areas highly impermeable. This
has made urban areas more vulnerable to water-related disasters. At the
same time, the overall occurrence rate of climatic induced water-related
disasters in Gujarat has increased. Recent flash floods have shown their
adverse impact on urban areas and the existing management of the water
supply is inefficient and unable to cope with the high risk of
water-related disasters. Often, it is the poorest city dwellers who are
most affected by this mismanagement. The current disaster management
plan is inadequate and does not consider proactive risk reduction
strategies. This paper has assessed the risk and vulnerability aspects
of urban disasters in Gujarat and has proposes more concrete strategies.
There is a need to have strong disaster management strategies which not
only reduce the risk due to water-related disasters, but also augment
access to sage, urban water resources for all urban dwellers.

T1  - Rainstorm flash flood risk assessment using genetic programming: a case study of risk zoning in Beijing
A1  - Hu, HaiBo
Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - In this study, a genetic programming (GP) algorithm is introduced to
solve the symbolic regression problem for flash flood risk zoning in
Beijing. GP operates in simulation of biological revolution and can
avoid arbitrariness in risk estimates. Herein, this revolutionary
computing searched for an appropriate model to best fit the training
samples which comprise the data fields of the predictand of Ripley's
K-values to be the posterior risk, and the predictors of the rainstorm
hazard index value (RHIV), physical vulnerability, terrain factor,
impervious surface area, and population density. After generations of
revolution, the optimal fit regressions for estimating the risk value
were determined in the form of function (parse) trees. Also, the grid
risk values were calculated using the deduced regression. The risk
zoning map indicates that the risk values are higher in urban areas,
which is reasonable in comparison with the distribution of historical
flash flood events. With an explicit model structure, this symbolic
regression manifests that the risk value is mainly determined by the
RHIV and impervious land surface and is weakly correlated with the other
risk factors, e.g., the physical vulnerability, the terrain factor, and
population density. Our research demonstrates that GP in an artificial
intelligence manner meets the needs of risk assessment in determining
the optimal fit regressions and is a promising technique for future
applications. Meanwhile, approaches are still available for improving
the GP application in the risk assessment, e.g., considering the
historical losses in posterior risk estimations and improvement in the
sampling training data.

PD  - 
AB  - Flash-floods are among the most devastating hazards in the
Mediterranean. A major subset of damage and casualties caused by
flooding is related to road submersion. Distributed hydrological
nowcasting can be used for road flooding monitoring. This requires
rainfall-runoff simulations at a high space and time resolution.
Distributed hydrological models, such as the ISBA-TOP coupled system
used in this study, are designed to simulate discharges for any
cross-section of a river but they are generally calibrated for certain
outlets and give deteriorated results for the sub-catchment outlets. The
paper first analyses ISBA-TOP discharge simulations in the French
Mediterranean region for target points different from the outlets used
for calibration. The sensitivity of the model to its governing factors
is examined to highlight the validity of results obtained for ungauged
river sections compared with those obtained for the main gauged outlets.
The use of improved model inputs is found beneficial for sub-catchments
simulation. The calibration procedure however provides the parameters'
values for the main outlets only and these choices influence the
simulations for ungauged catchments or sub-catchments. As a result, a
new version of ISBA-TOP system without any parameter to calibrate is
used to produce diagnostics relevant for quantifying the risk of road
submersion. A first diagnostic is the simulated runoff spatial
distribution, it provides a useful information about areas with a high
risk of submersion. Then an indicator of the flood severity is given by
simulated discharges presented with respect to return periods. The
latter has to be used together with information about the vulnerability
of road-river cross-sections. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

problem in many developing and developed countries. Flood disaster has
very special place in natural hazards and is considered as a major
natural hazard due to its devastating effects on the affected area. Its
effected area is not bounded; it is an unusual event of river basin.
Flood related problems and many other applications proved that these
problems could be solved through planning studies and detailed projects
about flood prone areas. Determining the flood vulnerable areas is
important for decision makers for planning and management activities.
multicriteria analysis methods (MCA) are used to analyze the flood
vulnerable areas. Geographical information system (GIS) applications are
used for managing, producing, analyzing and combining spatial data. The
aim in integrating MCA with GIS is to provide more flexible and more
accurate decisions to the decision makers in order to evaluate the
effective factors. Some of the causative factors for flooding in
watershed are taken into account as annual rainfall, size of watershed,
land use and the type of soil. The selection of criteria that has
spatial reference is an important step in MCA. The objective of this
article is to describe phases applied in study to analyze the flood
vulnerability structure: to determine effective factors causing flood
and to apply several approaches to MCE in GIS environment to evaluate in
finding the flood vulnerable areas, by using selected factors flood
causing to generate a composite map for decision makers.

T1  - From hazard reduction to integrated risk management: toward adaptive flood prevention in Europe

PD  - 
AB  - Flood risk has long been seen only as a hydrological phenomenon. Flood
risk management has therefore been directed almost exclusively toward
curative methods. Dykes and dams have attempted to contain the floods
while crisis management and insurance have compensated for loss.
However, the acknowledgement of human responsibility in natural
disasters has widened the epistemological field of natural-hazards
knowledge integrating the concept of vulnerability. Recent and
disastrous floods all over the world have highlighted the relative
failure of the existing risk-management system. Over the past fifteen
years, the increasing cost of damage has caused a reaction of the
authorities, who have expressed through various laws and incentive
measures their wish to develop integrated risk management. The
integrated approach uses not only curative methods but also land-use
planning, reduction of vulnerability and the development of public
awareness by implementing local emergency plans. Through some examples
in France, this presentation aims to suggest new ways of assessing
risk-management measures. The French territory, located between northern
and southern Europe, is concerned by all kinds of floods: slow-rise
floods in its northern part and flash floods in mountainous and
Mediterranean regions. For many years, the top-down institutional
approach has led to the implementation of measures ill-adapted to
Mediterranean regions. Thus, this presentation shows how some measures,
efficient for slow floods, are inefficient for Mediterranean torrential
floods. While the new European Directive on Flood Risk is willing to
reinforce flood prevention in Europe, it is important to take into
account the specific characteristics of each basin and each hydrological
context before implementing flood-reduction measures such as upstream
control, Vulnerability reduction or flood warning. Stakeholders and
institutions might implement an adaptive and territorial approach in
flood prevention so as not to repeat the serious mistakes that we have
seen for many years.

AB  - The intensification of extreme events, due to global climatic changes
and irrational land use, has materialised in the change of pluvial
regime and high precipitation amounts. Thus, the study of flash floods,
as a result of the rain-flow process, has an important place in applied
hydrologic research. Floods represent a hazard with high frequency and
magnitude in Romania, especially on rivers originating in the Carpathian
mountain area, with pluvial and nival source. Therefore, the
quantification of flood vulnerability and risk is necessary for a better
management of priorities in emergency situations. The flood risk
zonation is made in applied hydrology through floodable stripes, which
are produced using statistical analysis of past data series and their
integration in determinist spatial analysis models. The aim of the
present study is to identify the flood risk and the vulnerability of
infrastructure by determining the floodable stripes of the main river in
Niraj basin, where significant damages have been recorded after flash
floods. In order to achieve this, the methodology included a statistical
analysis of hydrologic probability using recordings from the last 43
years (1970-2013), as well as field measurements (topographic profiles
used as computational sections) integrated in GIS databases and complex
spatial analysis models. The results of the spatial analysis model are
illustrated through the flood risk map, generated as a product of
temporal flood probability and vulnerability of the territory. These
results can be successfully used in territorial planning projects and in
the management of emergency situations, but can also be included in
other spatial analysis models of flood risk.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper provides a framework for analyzing flood fatalities and
injuries, and it describes the derivation of a generalized flood risk
(i.e., flood consequences and their probabilities) function by
introducing an integrated index (the number of residential buildings
affected by a flood) that represents the major change in the power
relation among the flood intensity, regional vulnerability, and
resilience. Both the probabilities and the numbers of fatalities and
injuries clearly increase significantly after the flood severity (in
terms of the number of inundated buildings) passes a branch point. Below
the branch point, it is still possible for fatalities and injuries to
occur because of the variability in the data and the uncertainty in the
predicted fatality values. The empirical models of fatalities and
injuries due to floods in Japan suggested the usefulness in predicting
fatalities and injuries and evaluating the efficacy of the warning or
other emergency response measures.

of the catchment area and the flash floods taken into account. All these
events show the vulnerability of the catchment area studied to hydro
morphological and geomorphologic hazards, fact that draws attention to
their management by a new approach, namely of the flood risk management.
Flash floods produced in June 2006 in catchment area Ilisua had a rain
genesis, with values between 28 1/m(2) in the low area, respectively 53
1/m2 in high areas of basin areas. Low surface of the superior catchment
area has determined quick concentration of the water toward the main
collectors and formation by flood, phenomenon facilitated and by the
fragmentation relatively high of relief, thus ensuring a contribution
hydrological important. Floods formatted in superior river basin of
Ilisua River, have determined in addition by the erosion effect,
entrapment and redistribution of a huge volume of silt. At the end of
the paper, by applying the current concepts of the effect reduction in
impact with environmental, is proposed the series of structural and
nonstructural measures for reducing flood intensity. (C) 2016 Published

AB  - Purpose - The main objective of the study is to identify the vulnerable
areas for river-line and flash flood hazard and its mitigation through
GIS Database Management System (DBMS) of geo-hydrometeorological
parameters. The Dabka watershed constitutes a part of the Kosi Basin in
the Lesser Himalaya, India in district Nainital has been selected for
the case illustration.
Design/methodology/approach - The Dabka DBMS is constituted of three GIS
(Geographic Information System) modules, i.e. geo-informatics (consists
of geomorphology, soils, geology and land use pattern, slope analysis,
drainage density and drainage frequency), weather informatics (consists
of daily, monthly and annual weather data about temperature, rainfall,
humidity and evaporation) and hydro-informatics (consist of runoff,
sediment delivery, and denudation). The geo-informatics and weather
informatics modules carried out by comprehensive field work and GIS
mapping than both modules used to carry out hydro-informatics module.
Through the integration and superimposing of spatial data and attribute
data with their GIS layers of all these modules prepared Flood Hazard
Index (FHI) to identify the level of vulnerability for flood hazards and
their socio-economic and environmental risks.
Findings - The results suggest that geo-environmentally most stressed
areas of barren land (i.e. riverbeds, flood plain, denudational hills,
sites of debris flow, gullies, landslide prone areas etc.) have extreme
vulnerability for flood hazard due to high rate of runoff, sediment load
delivery and denudation during rainy season (i.e. respectively 84.56
l/s/km(2), 78.60 t/km(2) and 1.21 mm/year) whereas in
geo-environmentally least stressed dense forest areas (i.e. oak, pine
and mixed forests) have low vulnerability due to low rate of stream
runoff, sediment load delivery and denudation (i.e. respectively 20.67
l/s/km(2), 19.50 t/km(2) and 0.20 mm/year). The other frazzled
geo-environment which also found high vulnerable for flood hazard and
their risks is agricultural land areas due to high rate of stream
runoff, sediment load delivery and denudation rates (i.e. respectively
53.15 l/s/km(2), 90.00 t/km(2) and 0.92 mm/year).
Research limitations/implications - For hydro-informatics module it is
quite difficult to monitor water and sediment discharge data from each
and every stream of the Himalayan terrain due the steep and rugged
topography. It requires strategic planning and trained man power as well
as sufficient funds; therefore representative micro-watershed approach
of varied ecosystem followed for a three years (2006-2008) period.
Practical implications - The study will have great scientific relevance
in the field of river-line flood and flash flood hazard and its
socio-economic and environmental risks prevention and management in
Himalaya and other mountainous terrain of the world.
Originality/value - This study generated primary data on
hydro-informatics and weather informatics to integrate with
geo-informatics data for flood hazard assessment and mitigation as
constitutes a part of multidisciplinary project, Department of Science
and Technology (D.S.T.) Government of India.

AB  - Post-disaster rehabilitation and rebuilding efforts are oftentimes
spearheaded by government agencies rather hastily, to meet the urgent
demands of disaster survivors. However in the absence of pre-planning
for disaster recovery, they may increase community vulnerabilities due
to a break down in social ties and livelihood needs. There is a growing
recognition that adhoc top down policies should be replaced with an
understanding of the preferences and needs of disaster survivors. This
research is aimed at gauging the intended mitigation strategies that
survivors from the Himalayan region of North India expressed, following
the devastating flash flooding in 2013. A semi-structured questionnaire
was used to interview 316 residents from 17 villages in the State of
Uttarakhand to measure demographic characteristics, risk perception,
prior flash flood hazard experience, evacuation experience, damage to
home, and intended structural (relocate/building back better) and
non-structural (investing time and effort in emergency planning or
raising self-awareness and knowledge of threats knowledge) mitigation
measures. Findings suggest that relocation is not a preferred mitigation
strategy. Rather, an overwhelming majority of the respondents are
interested in emergency planning at the household and village levels.
Investing in revising and updating the plans at all levels of
government, reviewing the existing forecasting and warning system and
creating a robust risk communication plan with local input, strictly
enforcing the provisions of flood Plain Zoning Act, 2012, improving
hazard awareness programs and creating village level task forces with
direct linkages to the State disaster Management Agency are some of the
recommendations made.

AB  - Floods and landslides are frequent and destructive geo-hydrological
hazards that cause harm to people every year. We analysed data on 1292
landslide and 771 flood fatalities that occurred in Italy in the 50-year
period 1965-2014, to determine the dependence of the fatalities on
gender and age and the circumstances of death by type of hazard. The
multinomial probability mass function of the expected fatalities by
gender and age, as reported by national census data, were estimated and
compared with the observed landslide and flood fatalities. We identified
the age categories over or under represented when the observed
fatalities were respectively higher or lower than the modelled expected
deaths. We found that in Italy males are more vulnerable to floods and
landslides for most of the age categories. Apart from children, males
are over-represented up to the age of 89 for floods and up to 79 for
landslides, whereas females are under-represented up to the age of 59
for floods and landslides, and over-represented above 70 for floods and
between 60 and 79 for landslides. To consider the demographic and
socio-cultural changes over time, we performed a temporal analysis
splitting the record into two non-overlapping subsets of 25 year each.
The analysis demonstrated that the over-representation of males compared
to the females, both for landslide and flood is statistically
significant and does not vary in time, indicating a different propensity
towards the risk taking and a different degree of exposure between males
and females. Analysis of the data allowed to identify the common
circumstances of death. Landslides fatalities occurred frequently
indoor, whereas the majority of the flood fatalities occurred outdoor,
outlining the different dynamics of the hazards. Floods killed numerous
people along roads and drivers or passengers travelling in vehicles. We
expect that the results of this work will be helpful to design
recommendations for self-protecting actions, and proactive policies that
can contribute to reduce the human toll of floods and landslides in
Italy, and elsewhere. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

the process of preliminary assessment of flood risk a methodological
procedure for preliminary flood risk assessment from flash floods with
respect to the need for its updating following from directive 2007/60/EC
and its application in the conditions of a modelled territory{''}. The
methods which are used in the contribution emerge from practical
experience as well as from knowledge obtained from the available
literature and consultations with experts dealing with the given problem
in practice. The foundations of flood risk assessment are hypotheses on
the impact of physiogcographical attributes of basins on the origin of
floods. The conceptual framework for flood risk assessment of flash
floods comes from the definition of a multidimensional conception of
flood risk. The proposed methodology consists in the identification of
critical points and contributing surfaces from the viewpoint of creation
of a concentrated surface flow from flash floods and their adverse
impacts on the built-up areas of a municipality. The primary goal of the
assessment of risk of contributing surfaces was determining the
riskiness of the locality with an ordinal degree (i.e., low, moderate,
and high) and providing a foundation for a second stage, called
controlling risk. The resulting risk of contributing surfaces is
determined as a combination of danger and vulnerability according to a
set matrix. Processing and analysis of the input data as well as
visualization of the achieved results is carried out in the GIS
environment (ArcGIS 9.3, 10) in integration with a spreadsheet of

Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - The European ``Floods Directive{''} 2007/60/EU has produced an important
shift from a traditional approach to flood risk management centred only
on hazard analysis and forecast to a newer one which encompasses other
aspects relevant to decision-making and which reflect recent research
advances in both hydraulic engineering and social studies on disaster
risk. This paper accordingly proposes a way of modelling the benefits of
flood emergency management interventions calculating the possible
damages by taking into account exposure, vulnerability, and expected
damage reduction. The results of this model can be used to inform
decisions and choices for the implementation of flood emergency
management measures. A central role is played by expected damages, which
are the direct and indirect consequence of the occurrence of floods in
exposed and vulnerable urban systems. How damages should be defined and
measured is a key question that this paper tries to address. The Floods
Directive suggests that mitigation measures taken to reduce flood impact
need to be evaluated also by means of a cost benefit analysis. The paper
presents a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of early warning
for flash floods, considering its potential impact in reducing direct
physical damage, and it assesses the general benefit in regard to other
types of damages and losses compared with the emergency management
costs. The methodology is applied to the case study area of the city of
Sondrio in the northern Alpine region of Italy. A critical discussion
follows the application. Its purpose is to highlight the strengths and
weaknesses of available models for quantifying direct physical damage
and of the general model proposed, given the current state of the art in
damage and loss assessment.

PD  - 
AB  - Many rivers in Nigeria had been ungauged in the last three decades; this
worrisome scenario has impacted negatively on the livelihood of people
who live in flood plains. The general lack of up to date streamflow data
has made river basin management problematic especially in the area of
flood risk management and the development of a real time flood warning
system. Flood studies were carried out in the Ogun River Basin in the
southwest Nigeria using synthetic data generated by Rainfall-Runoff
Modeling using a combination of the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) curve number model and digital terrain modeling using
ArcGIS (R) 9.3 software to identify vulnerable areas in relation to
synthesized flood waves generated from the basin, extent of inundation
and ranking of the flash points that was equally done using proximity to
hazard source as a criteria. The total area in the basin covered by
fresh water swamps, salt marsh, and tidal flats at the lower course of
Ogun river is 49 km(2), while the spatial extent of the entire wetland
is 556 Km(2) accordingly. When a peak flood volume of 4 270 million m(3)
generated in September is routed into the fresh water swamp, about 33.4
m of flood depth was left unaccommodated, which will cause inundation of
the entire flood plain and severe damage on its path. Over 1.4 million
inhabitants were identified to be at risk in the area. When the entire
wetland was considered, the flood wave was reduced to an average depth
of 8.5 m which is still capable of causing grave damages in the
remaining parts of the flood plain. The flood wave was found to have a
residence time of about 45 days. Appropriate recommendations were given
for practical adaptations.

AB  - The paper presents a framework for the nation-wide assessment of natural
hazards, vulnerability and risk for the Republic of Georgia. Firstly, a
relational database was created in order to collect all necessary
information available. Secondly, hazard maps were drawn based on an
innovative approach of assessing the magnitude and frequency of
meteorological hazard types, where the corresponding formalization was
not yet satisfying. Thirdly, the associated economic losses were
evaluated and presented in monetary terms for some hazard types
(droughts, hurricanes, hail, frost, flash floods and earthquakes), while
for other types of hazards, the information remained descriptive.
Fourthly, based on the hazard inventory, an approach was developed that
allowed for the calculation of an overall vulnerability value for each
individual hazard type, using the Gross Domestic Product per unit area
(applied to population) as the indicator for elements at risk exposed.
The correlation between estimated economic losses, physical exposure and
the magnitude for each of the six types of hazards has been investigated
in detail by using multiple linear regression analysis. Economic losses
for all past events were estimated, and historical vulnerability was
estimated. Finally, the spatial distribution of general vulnerability
was assessed, and the expected maximum economic loss was calculated as
well as a multi-risk map was set-up. The presented method will
contribute to a reduction of disaster losses in Georgia and will foster
future efforts of harmonization of risk management strategies in the
country.

AB  - This paper traces the historic development of flood risk and the
antecedent conditions that contributed to the catastrophic consequences
in central South Carolina as the result of the 2015 flash flood. The
study draws on archival and contextual research to underscore
development paradoxes: the safe development paradoxfederal policies
aimed at making hazardous areas safer that have resulted in just the
oppositeand the local government paradoxlocal governments permitting
development of hazardous areas through lax land-use regulations and
zoning while their residents bear the burden of hazards events. These
paradoxes are used to illustrate the rapid development of an urban
watershed and associated increase in flood risk. A chronology of
development patterns from the 1930s with the expansion of the central
core urbanized footprint of Columbia shows an increasing level of flood
risk exposure as creeks were channelized, ornamental lakes developed,
and high-end housing built, all with local government approval. In
contrast, the uptake of National Flood Insurance policies remained below
national averages for the level of risk in the region especially in the
urbanized areas. Unabated hazard exposure and lack of mitigation set the
stage for the significant losses incurred in the 2015 flood event and
the uneven spatial variability in impacts. Unlike the impacts of
Hurricane Katrina or the 2016 Louisiana flash floods, the burden of
flood losses fell mostly on residents who could afford to bear the loss.
With the exception of the discussion about buy-outs, this catastrophic
flash flood event did not lead to a review of or change in land use,
building, or zoning ordinances. Instead, the relatively quick
residential recovery allowed the community to return to its predisaster
state with seemingly few lessons learned. (C) 2017 American Society of

AB  - Assessing and communicating public perception on flood risk became
essential for assuming effective and efficient management actions and
policies, especially in areas prone to extreme natural events (e. g.
floods). The current study explores the community awareness and
perception on flash floods and their role in fostering social
resilience, in relation to the mitigation measures carried out by local
authorities. The study-area is located in the Bend Subcarpathians
(Romania), a region known for its high seismicity and dynamics of
hydro-geomorphic processes (e. g. floods/flash floods, landslides). The
area proved its high exposure to flash floods in small river catchments
(below 200 km(2)), during some recent major events (e. g. 2005, 2010),
which impacted significantly the local rural communities, determining
great losses to their assets, as well as psychological effects. The
current research relies on a questionnaire-based survey which was
conducted in the summer of 2014 and addressed to 50 households form
seven rural settlements, significantly affected by flash floods.
Therewith, several structured interviews were held with local
authorities (e. g. local decision-makers, county Civil Protection
Inspectors). The questionnaire survey provides some valuable insight
into the local human vulnerability to environmental change and extreme
hydro-meteorological events, aiming to outline the previous personal
experience, people's awareness and worrying, as well as the
post-disaster level of preparedness. The survey underlined some
discrepancies between people's perception on the local authority's
reaction during and post-event and the local authorities' perception on
their response and preparedness measures. Moreover, a high interest of
local authorities to access scientific data (e. g. flash flood hazard
and risk maps, climate change projections) in order to support the
development of adequate mitigation measures, was also noticed. However,
the lack of financial support is still limiting factor in their
implementation, as well as the development of long-term strategies.

AB  - Attention to climate-induced migration has grown considerably in recent
years, reinforced by high frequency of droughts, storms and flooding.
Focusing on migrations induced by flash floods in Zhouqu and droughts in
central Ningxia, China this study illustrates key factors in the process
of policy options to support climate-induced migration. The study is
based on stakeholder interviews and secondary data processing. The
findings show that integrating sudden and slow-onset hazards, combining
top-down and bottom-up methodology and encouraging private sectors to
establish Public-Private Partnership, are the main policy options from
disaster relief perspective. Otherwise, two prospective transformations
are proposed in policy options, transferring from re-active migration to
pro-active migration, and from move & stay to hope & development in
the aspect of migrants' livelihood improvement.

AB  - In this paper, we seek to better understand the temporal and spatial
aspects of climatic stress on local resource production systems and
resource-use behaviors by including the perspectives of
resource-dependent communities. Field research was conducted over a
nine-month period in the remote north-eastern floodplain communities of
Bangladesh, considered one of the most climate-vulnerable, least
developed and under-studied regions in the country. This area is heavily
dominated by wetland ecosystems, and subjected to regular seasonal flood
and extreme rainfall events. Beyond these regular stresses, flash-floods
and drought are the two most destructive climatic stresses on livelihood
sustainability in the area. Data were collected in 12 villages bordering
two significant wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), involving
focus group discussions (n = 14), key informant interviews (n = 35) and
household surveys (n = 356). Our results show that climatic stresses on
rural livelihoods are catalyzed by human-induced environmental
degradation and local resource use behaviors, contextual features that
include both socio-economic and bio-physical properties. A climatic
event appeared as a stress to livelihood sustainability when it happened
in an untimely manner (e.g., flooding during resource harvesting
periods) and directly affected the production process (e.g., agriculture
and fisheries). We also found that human stress perceptions varied with
the level of locally-driven innovation and adoption of technologies,
which supports the important role of local experience and knowledge in
adaptation planning. Further research is needed into how communities in
different settings are already organizing to manage perceived climatic
stresses, including traditional knowledge systems, local innovation
networks and livelihood practices to help better con-textualize
adaptation policy.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential relationship between
flash flood events and convective precipitation in Catalonia, as well as
any related trends. The paper starts with an overview of flash floods
and their trends in the Mediterranean region, along with their
associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of,
and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the
paper focuses on the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula, for which there is
a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation
from the Fabra Observatory, as well as a shorter (1996-2011) but more
extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation.
Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective
contribution to rainfall, introducing the beta parameter as the ratio
between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any
period. Information about flood events was obtained from the INUNGAMA
database (a flood database created by the GAMA team), with the aim of
finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood
data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as
a Multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been
caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or
exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events.
The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values, of
precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated ETCCDI (Expert
Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices) extreme index, could point
to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in
land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was
concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain
this positive trend in flash flood events. The beta parameter has been
also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the
features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short
and local events, usually with daily beta values above 0.5, while the
minimum threshold of daily beta for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.

PD  - 
AB  - This article deals with mapping exposure (or external vulnerability) to
flood risk in two typical Mediterranean ephemeral streams the Barranco
de Carraixet and the Rambla de Poyo The floodplains of both streams are
within the metropolitan area of the city of Valencia (Spain s third
largest city) Following the Mediterranean model they are very fertile
areas (with intense periurban and highly productive agriculture) which
have recently absorbed the great urban expansion of the metropolis
Hydrologically these basins remain dry for most of the year but become
particularly dangerous during flash-flood events They generate a risk
pattern highly dependent on exposure since in general the hazard factor
is very difficult to map given the unpredictable nature of flash-floods
This work constitutes a proof of concept based on simple estimators
obtained from land uses External vulnerability or exposure is evaluated
as a function of economic land value and human exposure to hazard Land
value is directly taken from the cadastre whilst human exposure is
indirectly estimated from the location of population in relation to
time-activity profiles The temporal dimension is Introduced and three
exposure scenarios have been mapped related to different time periods
working days nights weekends and holidays
The results show different patterns of exposure for each plain In
Carraixet floodplain exposure is greater at night and on weekends and
holidays than during working hours on account of the dominant
agricultural and residential land uses In the Poyo plain there are no
major contrasts in absolute terms between day and night time although
spatial patterns of exposure vary from day to night during the day
exposure is higher in industrial and commercial areas (around
communication routes) whilst at night residential areas show more
exposure (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

PD  - 
AB  - Identifying the risk factors for morbidity and mortality effects pre-,
during and post-flood may aid the appropriate targeting of flood-related
adverse health prevention strategies. We conducted a systematic PubMed
search to identify studies examining risk factors for health effects of
precipitation-related floods, among Organisation for Economic
Co-Operation and Development (OECD) member countries. Research
identifying flood-related morbidity and mortality risk factors is
limited and primarily examines demographic characteristics such as age
and gender. During floods, females, elderly and children appear to be at
greater risk of psychological and physical health effects, while males
between 10 to 29 years may be at greater risk of mortality. Post-flood,
those over 65 years and males are at increased risk of physical health
effects, while females appear at greater risk of psychological health
effects. Other risk factors include previous flood experiences, greater
flood depth or flood trauma, existing illnesses, medication
interruption, and low education or socio-economic status. Tailoring
messages to high-risk groups may increase their effectiveness. Target
populations differ for morbidity and mortality effects, and differ pre-,
during, and post-flood. Additional research is required to identify the
risk factors associated with pre- and post-flood mortality and
post-flood morbidity, preferably using prospective cohort studies.

PD  - 
AB  - Among the natural hazards, flash flooding is the leading cause of
weather-related deaths. Flood risk management (FRM) in this context
requires a comprehensive assessment of the social risk component. In
this regard, integrated social vulnerability (ISV) can incorporate
spatial distribution and contribution and the combined effect of
exposure, sensitivity and resilience to total vulnerability, although
these components are often disregarded. ISV is defined by the
demographic and socio-economic characteristics that condition a
population's capacity to cope with, resist and recover from risk and can
be expressed as the integrated social vulnerability index (ISVI). This
study describes a methodological approach towards constructing the ISVI
in urban areas prone to flash flooding in Castilla y Leon (Castile and
Leon, northern central Spain, 94 223 km(2), 2 478 376 inhabitants). A
hierarchical segmentation analysis (HSA) was performed prior to the
principal components analysis (PCA), which helped to overcome the sample
size limitation inherent in PCA. ISVI was obtained from weighting
vulnerability factors based on the tolerance statistic. In addition,
latent class cluster analysis (LCCA) was carried out to identify spatial
patterns of vulnerability within the study area. Our results show that
the ISVI has high spatial variability. Moreover, the source of
vulnerability in each urban area cluster can be identified from LCCA.
These findings make it possible to design tailor-made strategies for
FRM, thereby increasing the efficiency of plans and policies and helping
to reduce the cost of mitigation measures.

T1  - Evaluating the Effects of Low Impact Development Practices on Urban Flooding under Different Rainfall Intensities
A1  - Zhu, Zhihua

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Low impact development (LID) is an important control measure against
extreme rainfall events and is widely applied to relieve urban flood
disasters. To investigate the effects of LID practices on flooding
control under different rainfall scenarios, this paper constructs a
rainfall-runoff model based on the storm water management model (SWMM)
for a typical residential area in Guangzhou, China. The model is
calibrated by using observed rainfall and runoff data. A total of 27
rainfall scenarios are constructed to simulate the change
characteristics before and after the LID practices. Also, the projection
pursuit method based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is
used to assess the flooding characteristics. The results show that the
constructed rainfall-runoff model can closely reflect the relationship
between rainfall and runoff, with all Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of
efficiency (NSE) exceeding 0.7. It was found from the simulation and
assessment of the constructed rainfall scenarios that the changes in
rainfall characteristics have a considerable impact on the constructed
drainage system and that LID practices can properly control the floods.
However, with an increase in rainfall peak coefficient, intensity or
duration, the control effects of LID tend to reduce. Particularly in the
scenario of relatively high rainfall intensity, the impact of rainfall
duration and the rainfall peak coefficient on the LID practices is
minor.

T1  - A REASSESSMENT OF US LIGHTNING MORTALITY
A1  - Ashley, Walker S
A1  - Gilson, Christopher W
Y1  - 2009///
PD  - 
AB  - Lightning is a unique weather hazard when compared to other perils such
as tornadoes, flash floods, and hurricanes since lightning itself does
not constitute a criterion for a severe event according to National
Weather Service guidelines. Indeed, the mitigation of lightning
casualties is complex since lightning is often preceded by no formal
warning and little informal warning, because of the unpredictability and
random nature of a lightning strike. This investigation tallies and
assesses the fatalities produced by lightning in the United States from
1959 to 2006 in order to reevaluate the specific vulnerabilities and
impacts associated with this deadly hazard. The study is the first to
assemble a comprehensive lightning fatality dataset for the United
States using both governmental and nongovernmental data sources. As with
previous studies that have examined data discrepancies at the state
level, the comparisons between traditional data sources such as Storm
Data and other alternative data sources reveal significant differences
in fatality tallies for the years when analyses overlap.
Mortality data are gridded and mapped at a much finer resolution than
previous studies in order to reveal the distinctive spatial
distributions of lightning fatalities, which are a combination of both
risk and human vulnerability. Although lightning is not a criterion for
either tornado or severe thunderstorm warnings, we assess whether
lightning fatalities during the 1994-2004 period occurred in conjunction
with these types of warnings. These warning data, in addition to radar
analyses from 1998 to 2006, illustrate that unorganized, nonsevere
thunderstorms are the most likely storm morphology yielding killer
lightning events.

AB  - In West Africa, a sharp decrease in rainfall has occurred in conjunction
with an increase in flood damage since 1970. The material damage and
loss of life resulting from floods highlights the undeniable
vulnerability of populations to this threat and illustrates the
importance of addressing the evolution of hazardous precipitation caused
by intense rainstorms. This work aims to improve our knowledge of the
behaviour of extreme rainfall in West Africa by studying the sub-hourly,
hourly and daily evolution of the most extreme rainfall events, a topic
that is especially important to those interested in studying the links
between heavy rainfall and flash flooding or inundation. This study
analyses the classes of extreme rainfall events in two distinct climatic
areas within West Africa using the meteorological scales relevant to
rainfall processes. The study is based on two precipitation datasets
recorded by dense networks of rain gauges set up within the meso-sites
of Niamey (Niger, Sahelian area) and the Upper Oueme Valley (Northern
Benin, Soudanian zone) from 2000 to 2010 and 1998 to 2010, respectively.
The Gumbel distribution was used to analyse the frequency of the maximum
rainfall series for durations varying from 5 min to 24 h. The
reliability of this model was examined, and the
Intensity-Density-Frequency (IDF) curves derived from it were used to
estimate the critical rainfall intensities at each site. The results
returned exceeded frequencies that were useful for the isolation and
classification of extreme rainfall cases using temporal characteristics.
The climatological results confirm the existence of a latitudinal
gradient in the mean annual rainfall and number of extreme events at the
mesoscale. The classification methods illustrate clear distinctions
between local, meso and synoptic scale events derived from convective
systems over the Sahel. In contrast, Soudanian climate conditions lead
to a nesting of the phenomena involved in the formation of cloud
systems, making it difficult to classify rain events in that area.
However, we were able to utilize the duration of rainfall events within
this zone to discriminate between types of convective systems that cause
extreme rainfall. For both areas, the proportion of precipitation in an
extreme event compared to total yearly precipitation served as a
suitable additional criterion used to objectively identify extreme
precipitation event types. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

AB  - The focus of this study is an analysis of building vulnerability through
investigating impacts from the 8 February 2013 flash flood event along
the Avenida Venezuela channel in the city of Arequipa, Peru. On this
day, 124.5 mm of rain fell within 3 h (monthly mean: 29.3 mm) triggering
a flash flood that inundated at least 0.4 km(2) of urban settlements
along the channel, affecting more than 280 buildings, 23 of a total of
53 bridges (pedestrian, vehicle and railway), and leading to the partial
collapse of sections of the main road, paralyzing central parts of the
city for more than one week.
This study assesses the aspects of building design and site specific
environmental characteristics that render a building vulnerable by
considering the example of a flash flood event in February 2013. A
statistical methodology is developed that enables estimation of damage
probability for buildings. The applied method uses observed inundation
height as a hazard proxy in areas where more detailed hydrodynamic
modeling data is not available. Building design and site-specific
environmental conditions determine the physical vulnerability. The
mathematical approach considers both physical vulnerability and hazard
related parameters and helps to reduce uncertainty in the determination
of descriptive parameters, parameter interdependency and respective
contributions to damage. This study aims to (1) enable the estimation of
damage probability for a certain hazard intensity, and (2) obtain data
to visualize variations in damage susceptibility for buildings in flood
prone areas. Data collection is based on a post-flood event field survey
and the analysis of high (sub-metric) spatial resolution images
(Pleiades 2012, 2013). An inventory of 30 city blocks was collated in a
GIS database in order to estimate the physical vulnerability of
buildings. As many as 1103 buildings were surveyed along the affected
drainage and 898 buildings were included in the statistical analysis.
Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied to better characterize
each vulnerability parameter. Multiple corresponding analyses revealed
strong relationships between the ``Distance to channel or bridges{''},
``Structural building type{''}, ``Building footprint{''} and the
observed damage. Logistic regression enabled quantification of the
contribution of each explanatory parameter to potential damage, and
determination of the significant parameters that express the damage
susceptibility of a building. The model was applied 200 times on
different calibration and validation data sets in order to examine
performance. Results show that 90% of these tests have a success rate
of more than 67%. Probabilities (at building scale) of experiencing
different damage levels during a future event similar to the 8 February
2013 flash flood are the major outcomes of this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier

cycle is regulated by Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council 2007/60/EC on the assessment and management of flood risks. The
paper deals with an application of preliminary flood risk assessment,
particularly flood risk assessment from flash floods in the Bodva river
basin, which is situated in the south of the Slovak Republic. The aim of
the preliminary assessment of flood risk from flash floods is
determining the hazard and the vulnerability of assessed area. The
result of identification of a hazard is the determination of critical
points in the basin and their contributing surfaces on the basis of the
geometric and physiogeographic characteristics of the contributing
surfaces. Vulnerability in the study area is determined on the basis of
the type and density of the built-up area. The resulting flood risk is
stated as a moderate risk. The scope and extremity of flood episodes
point to the need to build a comprehensive system of flood protection
measures in potential flood areas.

AB  - Floods, droughts, heat waves, and storms have always been part of human
lives because they are a normal part of climate variability. However,
the observed trends and projected changes in global climate have the
potential to alter patterns of these climatic hazards and extreme
weather events. Extreme precipitation is one of the factors that
contribute to flash floods, but it is the characteristics of the
environment, individuals, and society that can turn these natural
phenomena into life-threatening disasters. Past decades of disaster risk
research and assessments have lead to many innovative approaches to
integrating data across disciplinary domains. Recent advancements in
integration of meteorological information with other environmental and
social data, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), allow for
integrated spatial assessments of societal vulnerability to
weather-related hazards. A case study presented in this article builds
on the substantial body of previous and ongoing research that is focused
on developing improved methods for characterizing and quantifying
vulnerabilities to weather hazards, in general, and extreme
precipitation events, in particular. Integrating social science into
meteorological research and practice has been a key interdisciplinary
direction in the meteorological community. Therefore, with specific
attention to integrating spatially explicit information on weather and
society, this article focuses on interactions between meteorological and
social characteristics of an extreme precipitation event that resulted
in a flash flood disaster in Fort Collins, Colorado. Using the data from
1997 Fort Collins, Colorado extreme precipitation event, this study
constructs a straightforward methodology for integrating meteorological
data with readily available societal information into a GIS-based
analysis of vulnerable people and places. With the goal of developing
specific, targeted interventions and flash flood preparedness and
emergency response actions, the analysis of societal vulnerability
presented in this paper is specifically focused on the factors affecting
population's response and coping capacities to an extreme precipitation
event. Challenges associated with data limitations and integration of
meteorological and societal data, with diverse units and scales, into a
standardized relative vulnerability measure are discussed. (C) 2012

AB  - The Upper Alaknanda Basin constitutes a part of greater and Tethys
Himalayan zone in Garhwal region. The geology and geomorphology of the
area is very complex. The area includes schistose phyllite, schist and
granulites intruded by basal large gneissic granite and pegmatite and
different land feature like horned peaks, serrated crests, cirques,
hanging valleys, torrential rapids, waterfall and escarpments. The main
objective of this study is to analyze the geological and morphological
parameters for hypothetical hydrological and geological hazard
vulnerability assessment like landslides, Soil erosion, flash flood and
earthquake using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. On the basis of
geological and morphological parameters, Hypothetical hazards
vulnerability assessment of watershed has been done. There are eleven
watersheds, out of which 9 are of 4th stream order and rest of 5th. For
hydrological hazards, 2 watersheds are highly vulnerable, 7 moderately
vulnerable and 2 are having low vulnerability. Geologically, 3
watersheds are low, 3 moderate and 3 watersheds are highly vulnerable
for hazards. Remaining 2 watersheds are very high vulnerable for hazards
in study area.

AB  - An extremely destructive category 5 cyclone (Saffir-Simpson), Tropical
Cyclone Pam, struck Vanuatu on the evening of 13 March 2015, causing
serious damage to infrastructure across the capital Port-Vila. We
studied the coastal change, flash flood and damages effects three months
after super cyclone. A flash flood affected one slumurb in Port-Vila. We
studied the main features of the flood and also the vulnerability of the
residents. The tropical cyclone produced storm surges and extensive
inundation on severals parts of the coasts. The maximum wave heights
reached five meters. Washover deposits and testimonies were used to map
the flooding. Coastal changes (washover and erosion shape) indicated the
coastal morpho-sedimentary responses to extreme event. Whereas cyclone
advice to work very well (only eleven victims), the coastal risks and
flood seem to be unknown or underestimated despite a very high exposure
and vulnerability to risk.

AB  - This paper deals with the failure risk of masonry constructions under
the effect of floods. It is developed within a probabilistic framework,
with loads and resistances considered as random variables. Two
complementary approaches have been investigated for this purpose:
- a global approach based on combined effects of several governing
parameters with individual weighted contribution (material quality and
geometry, presence and distance between columns, beams, openings,
resistance of the soil and its slope...),
- and a reliability method using the failure mechanism of masonry walls
standing out-plane pressure.
The evolution of the probability of failure of masonry constructions
according to the flood water level is analysed.
The analysis of different failure probability scenarios for masonry
walls is conducted to calibrate the influence of each ``vulnerability
governing parameter{''} in the global approach that is widely used in
risk assessment at the urban or regional scale.
The global methodology is implemented in a GIS that provides the spatial
distribution of damage risk for different flood scenarios. A real case
is considered for the simulations, i.e. Cheffes sur Sarthe (France), for
which the observed river discharge, the hydraulic load according to the
Digital Terrain Model, and the structural resistance are considered as
random variables. The damage probability values provided by both
approaches are compared. Discussions are also developed about reduction
and mitigation of the flood disaster at various scales (set of
structures, city, region) as well as resilience.

AB  - Hydrological assessment is critical to the successful implementation of
adaption measures. In this study, projections of seven global
circulation models (GCMs) associated with high and medium-low
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5) for the
period 2021-2040 and 2081-2100 were adopted to assess changes on runoffs
in the Gilgel Abbay watershed, the upper Blue Nile basin. A weather
generator was employed to generate daily temperature and precipitation
to drive a hydrological model for impact assessment. Despite the
projected magnitude of changes varied among different GCMs and RCPs,
increasing runoffs in wet-season and decreasing in dry-season are
observed in both periods, mainly attributed to the change in projected
precipitation. Such changes are profound in cases of RCP 8.5 with
respect to those of RCP 4.5 and in cases of 2081-2100 with respect to
those of 2021-2040. Although the increasing runoffs would provide
greater inflow to Lake Tana, the increase of precipitation in wet-season
would imply a higher possibility of flash floods. On the other hand,
decrease runoffs in dry-season further intensify existing shortage of
irrigation water demand. These changes will have deleterious
consequences on the economic wellbeing of the country and require
successful implementation of adaption measures to reduce vulnerability.

AB  - Studies on disaster risk reduction primarily centers on the research
streams of vulnerability and resilience. The concept of adaptive
capacity is central to both streams of study and has profound
implications for disaster risk reduction. Drawing insights from both
streams, we examined the adaptive capacity of wetland communities with
regards to flash flood disasters. Focusing on societal dimensions, we
investigated how the interplay of institutions, community power
structures, and human agency shape adaptive capacity of wetland
communities. We employed the ``dominant-less dominant{''} research
methodological framework, and followed a 4-tier study design: i) a
household survey, ii) a semi-structured questionnaire survey, iii) oral
history interviews, and iv) key informant interviews. Our findings
revealed that wetland communities in the region are highly vulnerable to
flash flood hazards. Local community members were conditioned, chiefly
by the asymmetrical social power structure, to feel helpless in the face
of natural disasters. Their reactive recovery measures have resulted in
maladaptation and in their becoming passive towards risk mitigation for
future floods. However, transformative patterns were also observed in a
large proportion of the population, wherein community members modified
or changed their behavior to achieve longer-term sustainability and risk
mitigation. We concluded that in designing development interventions to
enhance adaptive capacity, consideration must be given to the diverse
range of skills and educational development among the local population.

AB  - Mountainous areas tend to be prone to a wide range of potentially
hazardous geomorphic and hydrological processes, such as rock falls,
landslides, debris flow, soil erosion, snow avalanches, flash floods and
cloudbursts on higher ridges. Risk assessment is carried out by
evaluating the vulnerability and types of hazards existing in the
region. The Upper Bhagirathi basin, particularly between Uttarkashi town
and Gaumukh, has been selected. A separate hazard map was drawn and
superimposed using the GIS technique. The main basin and areas close to
the road in Upper Bhagirathi basin lie in the category of very high risk
zone. The regions along tributaries of the Bhagirathi River, and away
from the national highway, lie in the moderate risk zone. The increasing
intensity of anthropogenic activities may contribute to the fragility
and the vulnerability to flooding and challenges to downstream water
resource management. The afforestation programme should be promoted on
the vulnerable slopes to mitigate the risks.

AB  - In Kota, the third largest city of Rajasthan, poverty levels are high in
many areas and there is a great need to assess the vulnerability and
adaptive capacity of different societal groups and sectors to the
impacts of climatic variability and change, and to formulate sustainable
planning strategies. The city is a large rapidly growing centre (but not
a megacity), facing a varied and challenging water situation and
anticipated harmful effects of climate change. The methodological
approach involves participatory workshops with key stakeholders in urban
administration to identify vulnerabilities, and discuss concrete
strategies for increasing the adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable
areas and sectors. The paper focuses on water resource planning (storm,
potable, and wastewater), since it is already a challenging societal
issue and one which will become even more critical in the future with
climate change. We aim to contribute to improved urban water management
for sustainable climate change adaptation in developing countries
through an improved methodology of vulnerability assessments, capacity
building and social learning, and a deeper empirical understanding of an
urban context in Central India.

AB  - Vulnerability studies have evolved significantly in recent decades.
Although not overly theoretical compared with some other fields of
science, some important conceptual progress has been made. At the
practical level, vulnerability indicators have been used either at a
generic level or for particular hazard contexts. However, these
indicators are often predictably too narrow in their coverage of aspects
of vulnerability. An important need remains to produce more conceptually
informed vulnerability indicators or parameters and more satisfactory
operational tools to assess weaknesses and resilience in coping with
natural risks. In this paper, we present the methodology developed in
the context of a recently concluded EU funded project, ENSURE (Enhancing
resilience of communities and territories facing natural and na-tech
hazards). The resulting vulnerability and resilience assessment
framework tool adopts a systemic approach embedding and integrating as
much as possible the multifaceted and articulated nature of concepts
such as vulnerability and resilience. The tool guides evaluators towards
a comprehensive and context-related understanding of strengths and
fragilities of a given territory and community with respect to natural
extremes. In this paper, both the framework tool and its application to
Sondrio in Italy, which is exposed to flash floods, are presented and
discussed. The merits and demerits of the new tool are discussed, and
the results of the application to Sondrio indicate where data are
currently missing, suggesting the kind of data, which will need to be
gathered in future to achieve more complete assessments. The results
also suggest vulnerability reduction policies and actions and further
ways of revising the existing framework tool in the future.

AB  - Flash floods are caused by intense rainfall events and represent an
insufficiently understood phenomenon in Germany. As a result of higher
precipitation intensities, flash floods might occur more frequently in
future. In combination with changing land use patterns and urbanisation,
damage mitigation, insurance and risk management in flash-flood-prone
regions are becoming increasingly important. However, a better
understanding of damage caused by flash floods requires ex post
collection of relevant but yet sparsely available information for
research. At the end of May 2016, very high and concentrated rainfall
intensities led to severe flash floods in several southern German
municipalities. The small town of Braunsbach stood as a prime example of
the devastating potential of such events. Eight to ten days after the
flash flood event, damage assessment and data collection were conducted
in Braunsbach by investigating all affected buildings and their
surroundings. To record and store the data on site, the open-source
software bundle KoBoCollect was used as an efficient and easy way to
gather information. Since the damage driving factors of flash floods are
expected to differ from those of riverine flooding, a post-hoc data
analysis was performed, aiming to identify the influence of flood
processes and building attributes on damage grades, which reflect the
extent of structural damage. Data analyses include the application of
random forest, a random general linear model and multinomial logistic
regression as well as the construction of a local impact map to reveal
influences on the damage grades. Further, a Spearman's Rho correlation
matrix was calculated. The results reveal that the damage driving
factors of flash floods differ from those of riverine floods to a
certain extent. The exposition of a building in flow direction shows an
especially strong correlation with the damage grade and has a high
predictive power within the constructed damage models. Additionally, the
results suggest that building materials as well as various building
aspects, such as the existence of a shop window and the surroundings,
might have an effect on the resulting damage. To verify and confirm the
outcomes as well as to support future mitigation strategies, risk
management and planning, more comprehensive and systematic data
collection is necessary.

PD  - 
AB  - The vulnerability of cities and communities in the Amazon to flooding
and flash flooding is increasing. The effects of extreme events on
populations vary across landscapes, causing vulnerability to differ
spatially. Traditional vulnerability studies in Brazil and across the
world have used the vulnerability index for the country and, more
recently, municipality scales. The vulnerability dimensions are
exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. For each of these
dimensions, there is a group of indicators that constitutes a
vulnerability index using quantitative data. Several vulnerability
assessments have used sensitivity and exposure analyses and, recently,
adaptive capacity has been considered. The Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) analysis allows spatial regional modeling using
quantitative vulnerability indicators. This paper presents a local-scale
vulnerability assessment in an urban Amazonian area, Santarem City,
using interdisciplinary methods. Data for exposure and sensitivity were
gathered by remote sensing and census data, respectively. However,
adaptive capacity refers to local capacities, whether infrastructural or
not, and the latter were gathered by qualitative participatory methods.
For the mixed data used to study adaptive capacity, we consider tangible
components for countable infrastructure that can cope with hazards, and
intangible components that reflect social activities based on risk
perceptions and collective action. The results indicate that over 80%
of the area is highly or moderately vulnerable to flooding and flash
flooding. Exposure and adaptive capacity were determinants of the
results. Lower values of adaptive capacity play a significant role in
vulnerability enhancement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The capital city, Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh, India, is exposed to
multiple geohazards as it is located both in a region which experiences
extreme physical phenomena due to changing climate, and in the
tectonically active Eastern Himalaya. The geohazards in Itanagar include
landslides, flash floods, soil erosion and earthquakes. Due to rapid and
haphazard growth in urban land use, the city' residents have been
increasingly exposed to these geohazards over the past two decades. The
high decadal growth rate of just over 111% shown in the 1991-2001
censuses has introduced many challenges with respect to the capital
city's development planning, and geoscientists are warning of land
suitability and stability in terms of rock types, soil, slope,
geomorphology and groundwater conditions in their scientific
communications. The present condition of the city has raised issues of
immediate concern related to effective hazard management. The
vulnerability of existing urban land use to landslides, flash floods and
soil erosion is increasing steadily, and Itanagar needs to become a
disaster-resilient hill city. Experts agree there is therefore a need
for appropriate engineering geology intervention as well as the
development of geoethical policies in sustainable development planning
of the city, which could be achieved by using a strategic urban plan
through community participation and awareness generation under the
Itanagar Urban Disaster Risk Reduction (UDRR) programme.

AB  - Madeira, like many mountainous volcanic islands, is susceptible to flash
floods. Throughout its history, about 40 large events resulted in more
than 1200 victims and countless damages. Recently, urban areas expanded
greatly, leading to a higher exposure of the population to flash floods.
In order to analyse ways to reduce vulnerability and decrease hazard in
the urbanised, flash flood prone watershed of the Machico River, the
construction of detention basins (DB) is simulated. A hydrological and
hydraulic model was performed to determine if they would be a viable
option to protect downstream populations. Modelling suggests that two 12
m high outlet structures, and a storage capacity of 111 298 m(3) (DB1)
and 121 095 m(3) (DB2), would reduce peak discharge by 72%, from a
precipitation event with a return period of 100 years. Two identified
sensitive Sections (S) had their fill rates reduced from 130.6% to
79.6% (S1) and from 128.6% to 33.4% (S2), thus preventing channel
overflow. A concise economic analysis was made in terms of
implementation and maintenance costs, as well as a SWOT analysis
highlighting that DB should be regarded as a viable engineering solution
to reduce vulnerability to flash floods hazards in volcanic islands with
small, steep, and urbanised watersheds.

AB  - A massive disaster occurred in June 2013 in Kedarnath, India, due to
cloudburst and extremely heavy rain along the Chorabari glacier. The
resulting flash floods further aggravated the instability of natural and
hill cut slopes at different places on the downstream side. The village
Rambara that existed in close proximity of Kedarnath was swept away
under flow of debris and water. The immediate surrounding area, which
housed over a hundred and fifty shops and hotels, was completely washed
away leaving no trace of civilization. This calamity in Uttarakhand is
considered as India's worst natural disasters after the tsunami in
December 2004. On the downstream of the affected areas lie other pilgrim
destinations that witness innumerable footfalls every year.
Investigation of the health of the slopes on the routes to these
destinations is therefore very important to ensure minimal damage to
humans and machinery. The Himalayan terrain is a tectonically active
mountain belt, having a large number of unstable natural and road cut
slopes. Such slopes with rugged topography lie in the high seismic
vulnerability zone. Further, the instability is aggravated by natural
and anthropogenic activities increasing at a rapid and uncontrollable
rate. In the light of the Kedarnath tragedy, more advanced research is
being conducted along the National Highways to monitor and prevent
slope/structure failures. This study was conducted to evaluate the
hazard potential along National Highway-58, near Saknidhar village of
Devprayag district by analysing rockfall using hazard rating systems and
numerical simulation. Rockfall hazard rating systems were applied to
evaluate the conditions of the slopes and to identify the associated
risks. Based on the field and laboratory analyses, the parameters
required for numerical models were determined. The bounce height,
roll-out distance, kinetic energy and speed of the detached blocks were
determined by using a competent rockfall simulator. The results obtained
were used to identify rockfall risk in the region. Optimization
strategies were applied during investigation by modifying the slope
angle, ditch width and ditch angle to assess the possibility of a hazard
to occur in different scenarios. The simulation studies revealed that an
increasing slope angle could significantly increase the kinetic energy
of the rock blocks. However, an increase in the ditch angle and the
ditch width reduces the energy of moving blocks. The maximum bounce
height above the slope varied from 0.003 m to 0.8 m for 10-kg blocks,
whereas the maximum velocity and the maximum kinetic energy under such
circumstances were 7.882 m/s and 379.89 J, respectively. The barrier
capacity was found to be 233.18 J for 10-kg falling blocks at a height
of 10.02 m. From the optimization studies, it was found that the risk
can be reduced by up to 13 % if the slope of 70A degrees has a ditch
angle of 15A degrees while on a flat ditch, the maximum risk will be at
an angle of 65A degrees. If the ditch angle is increased, the vertical
component of the falling blocks is more effective than that in case of a
flat ditch. These optimization studies lay foundation for advanced
research for mitigation of rockfall hazards in similar potential areas.

AB  - Participatory responses to natural disasters are currently considered to
be the primary tool for disaster risk reduction. However, the
implementation of this tool in post-communist Central European countries
is constrained by the strong position of the central government and a
weakened civil society as a heritage of the former communist
governments. This study analyses documentary sources to reconstruct
social responses to five disastrous flash flood events (1897, 1907,
1925, 1926 and 1927) in northern Bohemia, Czech Republic. The
reconstruction of social responses has revealed their complexity and
strong component of a participatory approach. The analysis shows that
certain historical measures and approaches to recovery from flash floods
can be useful for re-establishing and reinforcing former social patterns
in post-communist transition countries in terms of strategies for
disaster risk reduction.

AB  - This study describes the characteristics of the disaster-prone
communities in Infanta, Quezon and determine their level of
vulnerabilities. The disaster-affected communities consist of three
barangays purposively selected based on their topographical
characteristics lowland upland and coastal. The 107 respondents from the
three selected barangays were grouped according to their biophysical
characteristic, socio-economic characteristic, past experience with
disaster, and emergency preparedness and adaptation strategies to
disasters characteristics. The main assumption is that vulnerability to
disaster such as flash floods and mudslides was dependent on these
factors and since a significant number of residents were farmers, the
clusters were named as Low Vulnerable Upland Farmers, Law Vulnerable
Lowland Non-Farmers, High Vulnerable Coastal Farmers and High Vulnerable
Coastal Non-Farmers. The clusters in the coastal, low-lying areas whose
residents were either farmers or non farmers were considered the most
highly vulnerable communities mainly because they were relatively
poorer, less prepared for disaster and hadlimited strategies for
adaption. Being poor was closely associated with being vulnerable.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a multidimensional
approach for effectively managing natural disasters; this paper has
three research objectives. First, it provides an analysis on the
hydro-geomorphological effects of the cyclone in the urban context.
Second, it proposes an analysis for the vulnerability and resilience
recovery of the populations living in urban areas. Third, it specifies
the implications for sustainable recovery and longer-term disaster risk
reduction.
Design/methodology/approach - A detailed case study of the tropical
cyclone Pam was carried out to identify hydro-geomorphologic effects and
damages in an urban area and specific problems associated with managing
natural disaster in Vanuatu.
Findings - The investigations reveal that living in an urban area
increases a population's exposure to hydrological, weather and
sea-related risks. Whereas advice on cyclones seems to work very well,
the coastal risks and floods seem to be underestimated with a very high
exposure and vulnerability to risk. Pre-existing vulnerabilities were
exacerbated after cyclone Pam. However, other communities have been able
to reinforce their resilience through local initiatives. The government
and outside aid were very quick to react, despite problems of
coordination, exchange of information, communication and long-term
strategy.
Originality/value - This paper highlights the importance of
understanding how the urban communities are vulnerable to natural
hazards and of strategies for increasing their resilience.

Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increase in flash flood impacts, even
as our ability to forecast events and warn areas at risk increases. This
increase results from a combination of extreme events and the exposure
of vulnerable populations. The issues of exposure and vulnerability to
flash floods are not trivial because environmental circumstances in such
events are specific and complex enough to challenge the general
understanding of natural risks. Therefore, it seems essential to
consider physical processes of flash floods concurrently with the
impacts they trigger. This paper takes a first step in addressing this
need by creating and testing the coherence of an impact-focused database
based on two pre-existing public and expert-based survey datasets: the
Severe Hazards Analysis and Verification Experiment (SHAVE) and the US
National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Data. The SHAVE initiative proposes
a new method for collecting near-real-time high-resolution observations
on both environmental circumstances and their disastrous consequences
(material and human losses) to evaluate radar-based forecasting tools.
Forecast verification tools and methods are needed to pursue improving
the spatial and temporal accuracy of forecasts. Nevertheless by
enhancing SHAVE and NWS datasets with socially and spatially relevant
information, we aim at improving future forecast ability to predict the
amount and types of impacts.
This paper describes the procedures developed to classify and rank the
impacts from the least to the most severe, then to verify the coherence
and relevance of the impact-focused SHAVE dataset via cross-tabulation
analysis of reported variables and GIS-sampled spatial characteristics.
By crossing impact categories with socio-spatial characteristics, this
analysis showed first benchmarks for the use of exposure layers in
future flash flood impact forecasting models. The enhanced
impact-focused datasets were used to test the capabilities of flash
flood forecasting tools in predicting different categories of impacts
for two extreme cases of flash flooding in Oklahoma, USA. Results showed
a general tendency for the more severe impacts to be associated to
higher mean exceedances over tool values. This means that, at least for
these particular case studies, the tools were able to make a distinction
between less severe and more severe impacts. Finally, a critical
analysis of the NWS and SHAVE data collection methodologies was
completed and challenges for future work were identified. (C) 2012

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the detailed hydrometeorological
circumstances that lead to accidental casualties, and to better
understand the prominent physical factors of risk. Based on an event
that affected the Gard region (Southern France) in September 2002, it is
a first attempt to combine analysis of the physical and human response
to Mediterranean storms.
After details concerning the methodology (for meteorological,
hydrological and casualty analysis), the local context and the event,
the authors examine two points: the dynamics of the event (flash-flood
and riverine-flood response to the storm) together with human exposure
on the one hand, and scale as a critical problem affecting flood risk on
the other.
This investigation stresses the specificity of small catchments, which
are more dangerous both in hydrological and human terms. Moreover, this
contribution linking social sciences and geophysics constitutes an
important step in what {[}Morss, R.E., Wilhelmi, O.V., Downton, M.W.,

Y1  - 2009///
PD  - 
AB  - Despite the country's lowland character, flash floods have frequently
been reported from the hilly and low mountain catchments of Hungary
(e.g.: VASS 1997; HORVATH 2005; SZLAVIK & KLING 2007). To avoid
flash-flood damage, development of a flash flood guidance (FFG) system
was Suggested by the concerned authorities.
To generate a rapid screening based nationwide flash flood hazard
mapping as part of the FFG system, in the present study we considered
and included both passive environmental factors (PFB model), and
randomly, occurring active environmental Factors (precipitation).
Currently, we determined the (i) spatial and (ii) the temporal patterns
and behavior of rainfall events in Hungary and prepared a hazard map
that is based on both passive and active environmental factors (APFB
model).
Extreme rainfall pattern was analyzed both in time and space using data
provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
and the Hungarian Meteorological Services (HMS). The hazard map was then
validated using HEC-HMS simulations and calculated threshold discharge
values.
The spatial pattern of extreme events indicates a strong orographic
effect. The frequency of extreme precipitation is always higher on the
watersheds of the PFB model with highest hazard, than in both the zone
of the PFB model with the lowest hazard and the national average.
Consequently, the vulnerability of the passive factor-based most
endangered areas will be further enhanced by the the higher frequency of
extreme events.
Temporal changes are ambiguous based on the long term observed data of
extreme rainfall. Model indicated increase of extreme rainfall events is
not clearly shown based on the employed HMS and NOAA data. However, a
fluctuating cyclic pattern is clearly identifiable. The majority of the
observed years was characterized with a lower-than-average number of
extreme events. However, these long periods are interrupted with short
spells (usually lasting a year or two) when the number of extreme events
significantly exceeded the mean value.
The temporal frequency of flash flood events is lower than expected
based on model validation processes. This discrepancy is likely to be
explained by (i) the duration difference between the simulated rainfall
period and the observed rainfall period, (ii) the overestimation of
total runoff by the runoff model, (iii) the fact not all flash
flood-generated damages were reported to the insurance companies and
(iv) the inappropriate calculation of the discharge threshold values.

PD  - 
AB  - Building ``disaster-resilient{''} rather than ``disaster-resistant{''}
cities/communities requires the development of response capabilities to
natural disasters and subsequent recovery. This study devises a new
method to measure resilience via recovery capability to validate
indicators from social, economic, infrastructural, and environmental
domains. The pollutant discharge data (waste-water and waste-gas
discharge/emission data) of local power plants, sewage treatment plants
and main factories were used to monitor recovery process of both
people's living and local industrial production as the waste water/gas
is released irregularly during the short disaster-hit period. A time
series analysis of such data was employed to detect the disturbance on
these infrastructures from disasters and to assess community recovery
capability. A recent record-breaking flash flood in Changzhou, a city in
eastern-central China, was selected as a case study. We used ordinal
logistic regression to identify leading proxies of flood resilience. A
combination of six variables related to socioeconomic factors,
infrastructure development and the environment, stood out and explained
61.4% of the variance in measured recovery capability. These findings
substantiate the possibility of using recovery measurement based on
pollutant discharge to validate resilience metrics, and contribute more
solid evidences for policy-makers and urban planners to make
corresponding measures for resilience enhancement.

AB  - Surface water drainage system is one of the most important elements of
urban planning and areas which incorrect or inaccurate design of them
causes irrecoverable problems for human settlements and other land uses.
Inundated cities and the physical damages due to the floods (in
buildings, public spaces, etc.), public health and disaster management
and emergency acts costs are some kinds of problems due to inadequate
urban drainage systems. Rapid population growth, urban development and
industrialization of communities increase the acceleration of the
problems and provide new problems like sanitary and safety problems,
water pollution problems, increasing the flood intensity and flash
floods in downstream, decreasing base flow etc. Mitigation measures of
urban flood effects and their control will implement through the
accurate design of suitable load capacity of drainage networks;
consideration of the system's functions as an object lead designers to
simulation some different scenarios by models like empirical models,
mathematical models or laboratory physical models. This research has
simulated one the Tehran sub basins by SWMM, the mathematical model that
developed and presented by Environmental Protection Agency of USA (EPA)
for modeling the quantity and quality of surface runoff. In this
simulation, kinematic wave method (solving flow continuity equation in
unsteady state and manning equation) has been applied to flood
estimation and surface channelized flow elements was utilized. Flood
routing in channels was considered and calculated within dynamic wave
method. Final results showed that some zones of drainage system are not
efficient; then reparation and adjustment measures presented.
Additionally regarding to modeling validated results, SWMM considered as
suitable model for simulation of urban runoff in this case study field.

AB  - Urban and land use planning is conditioned by flood risk analyses and is
a great research challenge. While methods are available for quantitative
hazard and risk modeling, there is still a major gap related to reliable
rational approaches for vulnerability assessment. This is particularly
true for assessing vulnerability of buildings to floods. This
vulnerability, which is important for economic reasons as well as for
the safety of individuals and communities, is usually conceptualized on
an empirical basis. Such empirical approaches, however, are plagued by
considerable uncertainties, mostly because the damage-causing mechanisms
on the building envelope are poorly represented. In order to advance
this area, this paper focuses on the structural vulnerability of
traditional masonry buildings in alpine areas exposed to flash floods. A
simplified physically based conceptual model which requires a limited
amount of input data is proposed. The resistance of a wall impacted by a
flash flood is studied in a limit analysis framework, considering
different geometric ratios and building configurations. The resulting
stability thresholds, expressed in dimensionless form as a function of
the water depth, were positively compared with the results provided by
numerical finite element models of the investigated geometries. The
application of the proposed vulnerability model in risk mitigation
strategies provides reliable information, suitable for a first-level
risk assessment on large building stocks.

PD  - 
AB  - Extreme precipitation episodes are very common in Mediterranean area and
can lead to serious and catastrophic environmental hazards. They have
special incidence during autumn months, September, October and November
(SON) with important impacts on society, leading frequently to
significant economic losses and mortality. These events have special
impact in mountainous areas where steep slopes enhance the effects of
extreme precipitation. In mountainous areas rain gauge stations are
sparse and normally in lower amount. Due to these reasons it is very
important to map with higher accuracy the distribution of extreme
precipitation. Also, in mountainous environments precipitation patterns
can change in small distances that make the prediction more difficult,
but also more important. A better prediction of areas with higher values
of extreme precipitation will contribute to a better land use planning
and avoid the effects of flash floods, landslides and soil erosion
recognized as environmental problems. The aim of this paper is testing
several well-known interpolation methods, Inverse Distance Weight (IDW)
with weighs of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Local Polynomial (LP) with order 1 and
2, Radial Basis Methods (RBS), particularly Spline With Tension (SPT)
and Thin Plate Spline (TPS), and Kriging techniques, Ordinary Kriging
(OK) and Ordinary CoKriging (COK) in order to identify the less-biased
method to interpolate extreme precipitation calculated from the 95(th)
percentile (P95) of SON precipitation in a mountainous area located in
Portugal.
The results show that extreme precipitation increases with the altitude
and there are important differences between stations located at higher
and lower altitudes. This relation is observed in the omni-directional
semi-variograms calculated where we identified two major P95 areas
coincident with higher elevations. The first one occurred at 12.19 km
and the second at 23.57 km. The higher values of P95 are identified at
Southeast and Northeast. In contrast, the lower P95 values are
identified at Northwest due to lower altitudes and in the Northeast
corner as a consequence of rain shadow effect. Prediction with precision
of precipitation patterns in mountainous areas is difficult due to lack
of data and the complex effect of topography in rainfall, however, it is
of major importance in order to identify vulnerable areas. The findings
observed in this study are a fundamental contribution to landscape
planning and environmental management in areas with higher occurrence
and vulnerability to extreme precipitation.

AB  - Vulnerability assessment implies a quantitative evaluation of the
individual vulnerability components such as elements at risk, their
physical exposure and social characteristics. Current approaches in
vulnerability research are driven by a divide between social scientists
who tend to view vulnerability as representing a set of socio-economic
factors, and scientists who view vulnerability in terms of the degree of
loss to an element at risk. To close this gap, a multi-dimensional
vulnerability analysis has been undertaken focusing on flash flood
hazards in Greece. To represent physical vulnerability, an empirical
relation between the process intensity and the degree of loss was
established. With respect to social vulnerability, an assessment was
undertaken by means of empirical data collection based on a door-to-door
survey. In general, both physical and social vulnerability was
comparable low, which is interpreted as a result from (a) specific
building regulations in Greece as well as general design principles
leading to less structural susceptibility of elements at risk exposed,
and (b) a relatively low economic loss leading to less social
vulnerability of citizens exposed. It is shown that a combination of
different perspectives of vulnerability will lead to a better
understanding of perceptions of actors regarding their vulnerabilities
and capacities.

AB  - This study focused on the impact of flash flood (FF) on trace metal
pollution in the groundwater, Wadi Baysh Basin, Western Saudi Arabia
using spatial interpolations, integrating pollution indices and
statistical analysis. Groundwater (n = 182) is neutral to alkaline in
nature and the order of mean metals before and after FF are Sr > Ba > B
> Fe > Al > V > Mn > Cr > Cu = Pb > Mo > Zn and Sr > Al > B > Fe > V >
Ba > Cr > Cu > Pb > Mn > Mo > Zn > Ni > Cd, respectively. Enhancement
(Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Pb and V) and depletion (B, Ba, Fe, Sr) of trace
metals are noticed in the groundwater after FF, which is due to
dilution, dissolution/desorption, flushing of weathered layer, saline
sources and surface input. Before and after FF, 57-63%(Pb), 55-56%(V),
43-16%(B), 27-0%(Ba), 15-5%(Sr), 6-3%(Fe), 0-16%(Al), 0-9%(Cr) and
1-2%(Mn) of groundwater samples, respectively, exceeded the drinking
water standards. Coastal wells have elevated B, Sr and Mn concentration
due to saline water intrusion. Integrated pollution evaluation indices
(Heavy metal pollution index (HPI), Contamination index (C-d) and Heavy
metal evaluation index (HEI)) reveal that number of samples in the
unsuitable classes are increased after FF event (HPI: 13%-55%; Cd:
11%-38%; HEI: 5%-19%) and groundwater quality is degraded due to the
trace metals enhancement after FF especially in the downstream wells.
Wells in the upstream is flushed by FF recharge and groundwater flow
accumulated the metals in the downstream and coastal region. This study
demonstrates that metal accumulation and mobility are regulated by the
groundwater flow in the study region. Pearson correlation analysis and
Principle component analysis also justify that water chemistry is
influenced by the saline sources, flushing of weathered layer, natural
processes and anthropogenic inputs. Continuous groundwater monitoring is
an important task to protect and manage valuable groundwater resources
in the arid region.

PD  - 
AB  - The Cevennes-Vivarais region in southern France is prone to heavy
rainfall that can lead to flash floods which are one of the most
hazardous natural risks in Europe. The results of numerous studies show
that besides rainfall and physical catchment characteristics the
catchment's initial soil moisture also impacts the hydrological response
to rain events. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship
between catchment mean initial soil moisture (theta) over bar (ini) and
the hydrological response that is quantified using the event-based
runoff coefficient phi(ev) in the two nested catchments of the Gazel
(3.4 km(2)) and the Claduegne (43 km(2)). Thus, the objectives are
twofold: (1) obtaining meaningful estimates of soil moisture at
catchment scale from a dense network of in situ measurements and (2)
using this estimate of (theta) over bar (ini) to analyze its relation
with phi(ev) calculated for many runoff events. A sampling setup
including 45 permanently installed frequency domain reflectancy probes
that continuously measure soil moisture at three depths is applied.
Additionally, on-alert surface measurements at approximate to 10
locations in each one of 11 plots are conducted. Thus, catchment mean
soil moisture can be confidently assessed with a standard error of the
mean of <= 1.7 vol% over a wide range of soil moisture conditions.
The phi(ev) is calculated from high-resolution discharge and
precipitation data for several rain events with a cumulative
precipitation P-cum ranging from less than 5mm to more than 80 mm.
Because of the high uncertainty of phi(ev) associated with the
hydrograph separation method, phi(ev) is calculated with several
methods, including graphical methods, digital filters and a tracer-based
method. The results indicate that the hydrological response depends on
(theta) over bar (ini): during dry conditions phi(ev) is consistently
below 0.1, even for events with high and intense precipitation. Above a
threshold of (theta) over bar (ini) = 34 vol % phi(ev) can reach values
up to 0.99 but there is a high scatter. Some variability can be
explained with a weak correlation of phi(ev) with P-cum and rain
intensity, but a considerable part of the variability remains
unexplained.
It is concluded that threshold-based methods can be helpful to prevent
overestimation of the hydrological response during dry catchment
conditions. The impact of soil moisture on the hydrological response
during wet catchment conditions, however, is still insufficiently
understood and cannot be generalized based on the present results.

AB  - Almost 60% of the rivers in the northern hemisphere experience
significant seasonal effects of river ice. In many of these northern
rivers, ice-jam floods (IJFs) pose serious threats to riverine
communities. Since the inundation elevations associated with ice-jam
events can be several meters higher than open-water floods for the same
or even lower discharges, IJFs can be more disastrous to local

AB  - A quantification and possible effects of climate change on the water
cycle for a German alpine and pre-alpine region have been performed
using regional climate simulations. It showed out that temperature rises
around 3 degrees C until the end of this century with a maximum in the
mountainous area. Mean precipitation only slightly increases. The
intensities of hourly precipitation events increase dramatically which
involve more intense small scale flash flood events. Daily precipitation
sums also rise in future times which causes mainly large scale flooding
events. For the summer months June to August, a 30 % reduction of
precipitation was simulated. In combination with increasing
temperatures, the total amount of usable water is expected to reduce.
The risk of droughts also increases due to longer lasting and more
intense dry periods.

AB  - Floods are associated with factors such as: 1) river overflow; 2) flash
floods, 3) high tides associated with hurricanes; and 4) breakage of
control structures. Unfortunately, historical records of floods are
practically inexistent. Therefore, risk assessments are generally based
on indirect methods such as physical-mathematical modeling. The
development of a National Flood Index Map for the identification of
regions prone to floods is presented. The index proposed is based on the
topographic index developed by Beven (1979) but additionally considers
soil, hydrological and climatological factors. The process is detailed
for the hydrologic region Lerma-Santiago. In addition, the results are
compared with corresponding simulations of a routing model for the
floodplain of Tabasco. The results indicate that the index is able to
capture reasonably well the perennial and ephemeral flooded regions. The
Mexican Flood Index Map based on the proposed methodology is included.

AB  - This paper presents a study of the applicability of four satellite-based
rainfall algorithms using highly resolved data from the first Meteosat
Second-Generation satellite to derive hourly rain intensities. Saxony
serves as an example of the mid-latitude regions. The focus is on the
suitability of these algorithms to detect and to monitor (flash)
flood-related rain intensities. For this purpose, 9 days with high
rainfall amounts between May and August 2006 were analysed by comparing
the satellite rain intensities to gauge adjusted radar data. Five
different spatial resolutions were used to examine the effects of
spatial integration from small scale (18 km(2)) to large scale (57 600
km(2)) on (i) the quality of the satellite rain intensities (amounts and
locations); (ii) the related loss of spatial information; and (iii)
possible applications for flood risk management. The results show that
spatial integration leads to improvements of rain intensities and
evaluation scores; however, it also leads to decreased applicability for
estimating high-intensity rainfall events that affect small-and
medium-scale basins.

AB  - Due to its highly fragmented geomorphology, Greece comprises hundreds of
small-to medium-size hydrological basins, in which often the terrain is
fairly steep and the streamflow regime ephemeral. These are typically
affected by flash floods, occasionally causing severe damages. Yet, the
vast majority of them lack flow-gauging infrastructure providing
systematic hydrometric data at fine time scales. This has obvious
impacts on the quality and reliability of flood studies, which typically
use simplistic approaches for ungauged basins that do not consider local
peculiarities in sufficient detail. In order to provide a consistent
framework for flood design and to ensure realistic predictions of the
flood risk -a key issue of the 2007/60/EC Directive- it is essential to
improve the monitoring infrastructures by taking advantage of modern
technologies for remote control and data management. In this context and
in the research project DEUCALION, we have recently installed and are
operating, in four pilot river basins, a telemetry-based
hydro-meteorological network that comprises automatic stations and is
linked to and supported by relevant software. The hydrometric stations
measure stage, using 50-kHz ultrasonic pulses or piezometric sensors, or
both stage (piezometric) and velocity via acoustic Doppler radar; all
measurements are being temperature-corrected. The meteorological
stations record air temperature, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed
and direction, and precipitation. Data transfer is made via GPRS or
mobile telephony modems. The monitoring network is supported by a
web-based application for storage, visualization and management of
geographical and hydro-meteorological data (ENHYDRIS), a software tool
for data analysis and processing (HYDROGNOMON), as well as an advanced
model for flood simulation (HYDROGEIOS). The recorded
hydro-meteorological observations are accessible over the Internet
through the www-application. The system is operational and its
functionality has been implemented as open-source software for use in a
wide range of applications in the field of water resources monitoring
and management, such as the demonstration case study outlined in this
work.

AB  - Flood inundation maps are dependent on the topographic and
geomorphologic features of a wadi (drainage basin) in arid regions,
which are most susceptible for potential flash flood occurrences, such
as in the southwestern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is not
possible to control the potential flood hazards by using only
technological instruments that forewarn the occurrences or imminence.
Additionally, it would be better to prepare flood risk maps so as to
delineate the risky areas to educate the administrators and local
settlers. The availability of these maps is the key requirement for any
urban development that entails land use allocation, identification of
dam, tunnel, highway, bridge sites, and infrastructure locations for
sustainable future. This paper suggests the necessary steps in flood
inundation map preparation after determining the possible flood
discharge. For this purpose, a set of critical cross-sections along the
possible flood plain are taken in the field with surveying methods and
measurements. The calculation of the average flow velocity in each
section is calculated according to the cross-section geometric,
hydraulic, and material properties. Synthetic rating curves (SRC) are
prepared for each cross section, which are very useful especially in
arid and semi-arid regions where there are no perennial surface water
flows for natural rating curve measurements. All the SRCs appear in the
form of power function which relates the flow depth to discharge in a
given cross section. It is then possible to calculate the flood depth in
the cross section through its SRC. Depending on the cross-section shape,
the flood width can be calculated. The connection of a series of widths
on a scaled topographic map delineates the flood inundation area. If
digital elevation map (DEM) is available, then the SRCs can be
integrated with these maps and the flood inundation delineation can be
achieved automatically. Since DEMs are not available, the topographic
maps are used for this purpose in order to delineate flood inundation
areas within wadis Hali and Yiba from the southwestern Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia.

AB  - Along with flash floods, landslides are one of the most widespread and
damaging natural hazards in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This paper
determines areas susceptible to landslides in the Municipality of Banja
Luka (Republika Srpska, northwest Bosnia and Herzegovina). Based on a
terrain survey in a 55.4 km(2) area, 216 landslides were identified with
a total area of 2.9 km(2) or 5.2% of the municipality. According to
landslide susceptibility modeling, low susceptibility is present from
one-quarter to one-half of the territory and very high susceptibility is
present from several percentages up to one-third of the territory,
depending on the model used. The results may support government
mitigation programs and help in developing a landslide hazard and risk
assessment model for the area.

AB  - In this paper, outcomes from an investigation of plausible climate
futures over the next century, and the potential impacts on water
services including water resource management and disaster risk
reduction, such as flash flooding in Ekurhuleni (EMM), are presented.
Four key aspects are examined: (i) the extent to which the frequency of
extreme rainfall events may change in South Africa as a result of
climate change; (ii) the identification of some of the implications of
extreme rainfall events for local government (iii) the identification of
some of the challenges communities most at risk of flooding as a result
of extreme rainfall events face, finally, (iv) the opportunities for
future co-production of design methods and approaches to reduce current
and future climate risks in EMM and elsewhere. Climate modelling
conducted for this research indicates that it is plausible for an
increase in the number of extreme rainfall events to occur over central
and eastern South Africa over the next century. Over EMM, for example,
an increase in extreme rainfall events is likely to be accompanied by
flash flooding and a range of deleterious impacts, if planning and
maintenance of the water services infrastructure is not improved - a
result that is likely to be valid for all large metropolitan
municipalities in the country. The paper provides some lessons learnt
when trying to include a climate risk reduction approach into the
planning of urban development.

AB  - Recently running climate changes have resulted in an increased incidence
of natural phenomenon that can adversely affect the life of people - so
called flash floods. A typical characteristic of these floods is their
very rapid onset, relatively short peak and rapid retreat. This short
period varies and might range somewhere between few minutes up to one
hour. In addition, these flash floods often affect areas without recent
precipitations.
The research is focused on the heavy rain indication in risk areas and
on the heavy rain outflow trajectory assessment to give an early warning
to the threatened areas. The developed method is based on the weather
radar data processing and detection of heavy rainfall in the affected
area. The results are presented on the example of the flash flood which
badly striked the village of Jesenik nad Odrou in 2009. If our procedure
had been available at that time, its application could have prevented or
at least reduced the number of fatalities.
In the future, it is expected that our proposed approach will be
integrated into the system Floreon+, which is used to predict floods in
the Moravian-Silesian Region in the Czech Republic.

AB  - In France, government and specific services (SCHAPI) survey overflow
stream floods (100.000km(2)) but flash floods characterized by fast,
quick and dangerous responses (other 100.000km(2)) remain delicate to
predict and difficult to monitor. It's about to explore the conditions
of establishment of a proactive and innovative alert system via
smartphones, to cope the risks associated with flash floods. The
solution must be thought in way to achieve a major challenge: reducing
the gap between a state approach (TOP-DOWN), which positions and imposed
the state as the main official alert source, and the citizen action
(Bottum-UP) which establishes the individual as ``Citizen sensor{''}
(both in go up or disseminate information) through the use of its
smartphone. Addressing this challenge is indispensable if we hope
effectively minimize material and human damages especially when high
temporal acuity phenomena such as flash floods happen.
Consequently, we propose to use Smartphone technologies: to reduce the
time required to alert and to protect population; to enhance information
observed by any people at local scales; to built automatic vigilance
based on these ``citizens-sensors{''}; to use field experiment to
improve knowledge on flash floods actually available after damaged
events; to use geo-location of transmitter sources to alert people
located at 5 km around.

AB  - Earthquake-induced-landslides will change the underlying surface
conditions (topography, vegetation cover rate, etc.), which consequently
may influence the hydrologic response and then change the flash flood
risk. The Jianpinggou catchment, located in the Wenchuan earthquake
(occurred in Sichuan, China, 2008) affected area, is selected as the
study area. The distribution of the landslides is obtained from the
remote sensing image data. The changes of topography are obtained from
the comparisons among digital elevation models (DEMs) during different
periods. A physical-based model, the integrated hydrology model (InHM),
is used to simulate the hydrologic response before and after the
landslide. The influence of the underlying surface conditions is then
discussed based on the simulation results. The results reveal that
landslides cause significant effects on the hydrologic response, and the
impact is proportional to the proportion of surface flow in the total
runoff. The effect of landslides on the runoff is insignificant at the
outlet, but obvious in the local area. The larger the rainfall, the more
visible the impact, and the impact of landslides will increase rapidly
at the threshold of the runoff (the total rainfall of 235 mm in 6 h in
the study area), but there is a limit with the further enlarged
rainfall. The improved understanding of the impact of landslides on the
hydrologic response provides valuable theoretical support for storm
flood forecasting.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate flash flood potential areas in the
Western Cape Province of South Africa, by integrating remote sensing
products of high rainfall intensity, antecedent soil moisture and
topographic wetness index (TWI). Rainfall has high spatial and temporal
variability, thus needs to be quantified at an area in real time from
remote sensing techniques unlike from sparsely distributed, point gauge
network measurements. Western Cape Province has high spatial variation
in topography which results in major differences in received rainfall
within areas not far from each other. Although high rainfall was
considered as the major cause of flash flood, also other contributing
factors such as topography and antecedent soil moisture were considered.
Areas of high flash flood potential were found to be associated with
high rainfall, antecedent precipitation and TWI. Although TRMM 3B42 was
found to have better rainfall intensity accuracy, the product is not
available in near real time but rather at a rolling archive of three
months; therefore, Multi- sensor precipitation estimate rainfall
estimates available in near real time are opted for flash flood events.
Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture observations were found to
have a reasonable r value of 0.58 and relatively low MAE of 3.8 when
validated with in situ soil moisture measurements. The results of this
study underscore the importance of ASCAT and TRMM satellite datasets in
mapping areas at risk of flooding.

AB  - Mountain catchments are prone to flash flooding due to heavy rainfall.
Enhanced understanding of the generation and evolution processes of
flash floods is essential for effective flood risk management. However,
traditional distributed hydrological models based on kinematic and
diffusion wave approximations ignore certain physical mechanisms of
flash floods and thus bear excessive uncertainty. Here a hydrodynamic
model is presented for flash floods based on the full two-dimensional
shallow water equations incorporating rainfall and infiltration.
Laboratory experiments of overland flows were modelled to illustrate the
capability of the model. Then the model was applied to resolve two
observed flash floods of distinct magnitudes in the Lengkou catchment in
Shanxi Province, China. The present model is shown to be able to
reproduce the flood flows fairly well compared to the observed data. The
spatial distribution of rainfall is shown to be crucial for the
modelling of flash floods. Sensitivity analyses of the model parameters
reveal that the stage and discharge hydrographs are more sensitive to
the Manning roughness and initial water content in the catchment than to
the Green-Ampt head. Most notably, as the flash flood augments due to
heavier rainfall, the modelling results agree with observed data better,
which clearly characterizes the paramount role of rainfall in dictating
the floods. From practical perspectives, the proposed model is more
appropriate for modelling large flash floods.

AB  - In recent years, the Free State of Saxony (Eastern Germany) was
repeatedly hit by both extensive riverine flooding, as well as flash
flood events, emerging foremost from convective heavy rainfall.
Especially after a couple of small-scale, yet disastrous events in 2010,
preconditions, drivers, and methods for deriving flash flood related
early warning products are investigated. This is to clarify the
feasibility and the limits of envisaged early warning procedures for
small catchments, hit by flashy heavy rain events. Early warning about
potentially flash flood prone situations (i.e., with a suitable lead
time with regard to required reaction-time needs of the stakeholders
involved in flood risk management) needs to take into account not only
hydrological, but also meteorological, as well as communication issues.
Therefore, we propose a threefold methodology to identify potential
benefits and limitations in a real-world warning/reaction context.
First, the user demands (with respect to desired/required warning
products, preparation times, etc.) are investigated. Second, focusing on
small catchments of some hundred square kilometers, two quantitative
precipitation forecasts are verified. Third, considering the user needs,
as well as the input parameter uncertainty (i.e., foremost emerging from
an uncertain QPF), a feasible, yet robust hydrological modeling approach
is proposed on the basis of pilot studies, employing deterministic,
data-driven, and simple scoring methods.

T1  - Measuring eco-roof mitigation on flash floods via GIS simulation
A1  - Liu, Chunlu
A1  - Li, Yan
Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Purpose - The rapid and ongoing expansion of urbanised impervious areas
could lead to more frequent flood inundation in urban flood-prone
regions. Nowadays, urban flood inundation induced by rainstorm is an
expensive natural disaster in many countries. In order to reduce the
flooding risk, eco-roof systems (or green roof systems) could be
considered as an effective mechanism of mitigating flooding disasters
through their rainwater retention capability. However, there is still a
lack of examining the stormwater management tool. The purpose of this
paper is to evaluate the effects on flooding disaster from extensive
green roofs.
Design/methodology/approach - Based on geographical information system
(GIS) simulation, this research presents a frame of assessing eco-roof
impacts on urban flash floods. The approach addresses both urban
rainfall-runoff and underground hydrologic models for traditional
impervious and green roofs. Deakin University's Geelong Waurn Ponds
campus is chosen as a study case. GIS technologies are then utilised to
visualise and analyse the effects on flood inundation from surface
properties of building roofs.
Findings - The results reveal that the eco-roof systems generate varying
degrees of mitigation of urban flood inundation with different return
period storms.
Originality/value - Although the eco-roof technology is considered as an
effective stormwater management tool, it is not commonly adopted and
examined in urban floods. This study will bring benefits to urban
planners for raising awareness of hazard impacts and to construction
technicians for considering disaster mitigation via roof technologies.
The approach proposed here could be used for the disaster mitigation in

AB  - Nowcasting systems are essential to prevent extreme events and reduce
their socio-economic impacts. The major challenge of these systems is to
capture high-risk situations in advance, with good accuracy, location
and time. Uncertainties associated with the precipitation events have an
impact on the hydrological forecasts, especially when it concerns
localized flash flood events. Radar monitoring can help to detect the
space-time evolution of rain fields, but nowcasting techniques are
needed to go beyond the observation and provide scenarios of rainfall
for the next hours of the event. In this study, we investigate a
space-time geostatistical framework to generate multiple scenarios of
future rainfall. The rainfall ensemble is generated based on space-time
properties of precipitation fields given by radar measurements and
rainfall data from rain gauges. The aim of this study is to investigate
the potential of a framework that applies a geostatistical conditional
simulation method to generate an ensemble nowcasting of rainfall fields.
The Var region (south eastern France) and 14 events are used to validate
the approach. Results show that the proposed method can be a solution to
combine information from radar fields and rain gauges to generate
nowcasting rainfall fields adapted for flash flood alert.

AB  - Coastal plains with a unique geographic setting and renewable natural
resources are promising for sustainable development; however, these
areas may be subjected to some environmental hazards due to their
geological setting. One of those hazards is the seasonal flash flood
that can threaten existing and future development projects in such
critical areas. Southwestern Sinai, Egypt, is a coastal plain that is
characterized by complex geological setting an arid climate with
seasonal rainfall which can result in a high runoff. The aim of this
work is to model spatially the runoff amount and density related to
flash flood development and to create a flash flood hazard map of the
plain as an example of coastal plain in a desert environment with large
and complex hydrologic setting. In this research, ASTER images are used
to develop a digital elevation model (DEM) and land use/land cover
(LULC) data sets of the study area. Geographic information system (GIS)
was used to perform runoff and flash potential flood analyses of the
created databases and to show distributed runoff and flooding potential
in spatial maps. A module was created in a GIS environment to develop a
flash flood potential index map. It was clear that the main two factors
controlling runoff amounts and flash flood potential in such kinds of
areas are the slope and soil types. The final dataset map procedure by
this work can be very helpful in land use planning by highlighting the
areas subjected to flash floods.

AB  - Floods are among the significant natural hazards in Algeria. They cause
severe casualties, damage to building and destruction of roads, public
works, and infrastructures. Northwestern Algeria has experienced
devastating floods in the past that caused considerable damage, e. g.,
Mohammadia 1881, Mostaganem 1927, and El Asnam 1966. Analysis of
historical floods is one of the major tools in flood hazard assessment
that enables predicting future flood events. One of the objectives of
this work is to address the gap of available information regarding the
floods that happened in Algeria, particularly during historical times.
The first historical data analysis that we performed on the basis of an
intensive survey shows that the study area is subject to flooding. This
inventory is the first step towards flood zonation and construction of
an atlas of extreme floods in northwestern Algeria. The catalog of
historical floods contains more than 127 documented events. As results,
this paper presents a method of compiling historical flooding data and
the analysis of the obtained database which represents a major
contribution to flood risk assessment.

T1  - Flash flood risk assessment for upper Teesta river basin: using the hydrological modeling system (HEC-HMS) software
A1  - Mandal, Subhra Prakash

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Flash flood is one of the devastating natural disaster in the
mountainous region of India. In Sikkim-Darjeeling Himalaya Teesta
Watershed is a probable flash flood occurrence zone. The present study
is an attempt to develop a simulation model of surface runoff in upper
Teesta basin, which directly related to catastrophic flood happenings.
At the first stage, a primary unit hydrograph is developed with time for
an excess rainfall event by estimating the stream flow response at the
outlet of the watershed. Specifically, the methodology was based on
meteorological and morphological data processing in the geospatial
environment and on data editing. Rainfall time-series data collected
from India Meteorological Department and processed to calculate water
flow to evaluate peak Discharge over time and estimate the runoff
volume. Apart from the meteorological data, background data such as
topography, drainage network, land cover and geological data were also
collected. Clipping off the watershed from the entire area and the
streamline generation for Teesta watershed was done from Aster DEM data
using the LPS Tool and Arc GIS environment. A part of this model is to
build geospatially input CN grid data based on land use, hydrological
soil group and eluviation of the area. The analysis of the different
hydraulic model to detect flash flood probability was done using
HEC-RAS, and HEC-HMS Software, which was of great importance to achieve
the final result. 313 km(2) area was found to be most vulnerable to
flash flood includes Singtam, Melli, Jourthang, Chungthang and Lachung
and 655 km(2) as moderately susceptible includes Teesta Bazar, Rangpo,
Yumthang, Dambung and Thangu Valley. The simulation model based on the
watershed and its surface characteristics of the soil, land use land
cover and altitude of the area and the discharge volume of water with
time. This model validated by inserting the rainfall data of a flood
event, which took place on 2nd to 5th October in 1968, and 78 % of the
actual area flooded reflected in the output of the model.

PD  - 
AB  - Climate, weather and water hazards do not recognize national boundaries.
Transboundary/regional programs and cooperation are essential to reduce
the loss of lives and damage to livelihoods when facing these hazards.
The development and implementation of systems to provide early warnings
for severe weather events such as cyclones and flash floods requires
data and information sharing in real time, and coordination among the
government agencies at all levels. Within a country, this includes
local, municipal, provincial-to-national levels as well as regional and
international entities involved in hydrometeorological services and
Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). Of key importance are the National
Meteorological and Hydrologic Services (NMHSs). The NMHS is generally
the authority solely responsible for issuing warnings for these hazards.
However, in many regions of the world, the linkages and interfaces
between the NMHS and other agencies are weak or non-existent. Therefore,
there is a critical need to assess, strengthen, and formalize
collaborations when addressing the concept of reducing risk and impacts
from severe weather and floods. The U.S. Agency for International
Development/Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance; the United
Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO); the WMO Southern Africa
Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, hosted by the South African
Weather Service; the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration/National Weather Service and the Hydrologic Research
Center (a non-profit corporation) are currently implementing a project
working with Southern Africa NMHSs on addressing this gap. The project
aims to strengthen coordination and collaboration mechanisms from
national to local levels. The project partners are working with the
NMHSs to apply and implement appropriate tools and infrastructure to
enhance currently operational severe weather and flash flood early
warning systems in each country in support of delivery and communication
of warnings for the DRR entities at the regional, national and local
levels in order to reduce the loss of life and property.

AB  - During the autumn of 2011 two catastrophic, very intense rainfall events
affected two different parts of the Liguria Region of Italy causing
various flash floods. The first occurred in October and the second at
the beginning of November. Both the events were characterized by very
high rainfall intensities (> 100 mm h(-1)) that persisted on a small
portion of territory causing local huge rainfall accumulations (> 400 mm
6 h(-1)).
Two main considerations were made in order to set up this work. The
first consideration is that various studies demonstrated that the two
events had a similar genesis and similar triggering elements. The second
very evident and coarse concern is that two main elements are needed to
have a flash flood: a very intense and localized rainfall event and a
catchment (or a group of catchments) to be affected. Starting from these
assumptions we did the exercise of mixing the two flash flood
ingredients by putting the rainfall field of the first event on the main
catchment struck by the second event, which has its mouth in the biggest
city of the Liguria Region: Genoa.
A complete framework was set up to quantitatively carry out a ``what
if{''} experiment with the aim of evaluating the possible damages
associated with this event. A probabilistic rainfall downscaling model
was used to generate possible rainfall scenarios maintaining the main
characteristics of the observed rainfall fields while a hydrological
model transformed these rainfall scenarios in streamflow scenarios. A
subset of streamflow scenarios is then used as input to a 2-D hydraulic
model to estimate the hazard maps, and finally a proper methodology is
applied for damage estimation. This leads to the estimation of the
potential economic losses and of the risk level for the people that stay
in the affected area.
The results are interesting, surprising and in a way worrying: a rare
but not impossible event (it occurred about 50 km away from Genoa) would
have caused huge damages estimated between 120 and EUR 230 million for
the affected part of the city of Genoa, Italy, and more than 17 000
potentially affected people.

AB  - Abouelreesh is one of the most at risk areas in Aswan, Egypt, which
suffers from storms, poor drainage, and flash flooding. These phenomena
affect the urban areas and cause a lot of damage to buildings and
infrastructure. Moreover, the potential for the further realization of
dangerous situations increased when the urban areas of Abouelreesh
extended towards the risk areas. In an effort to ameliorate the danger,
two key issues for urban growth management were studied, namely: (i)
estimations regarding the pace of urban sprawl, and (ii) the
identification of urban areas located in regions that would be affected
by flash floods. Analyzing these phenomena require a lot of data in
order to obtain good results, but in our case, the official data or
field data was limited so we tried to obtain it by accessing two kinds
of free sources of satellite data. First, we used Arc GIS tools to
analyze (digital elevation model (DEM)) files in order to study the
watershed and better identify the risk area. Second, we studied
historical imagery in Google Earth to determine the age of each urban
block. The urban growth rate in the risk areas had risen to 63.31% in
2001. Urban growth in the case study area had been influenced by house
sizes, because most people were looking to live in bigger houses. The
aforementioned problem can be observed by considering the increasing
average house sizes from 2001 until 2013, where, especially in risky
areas, the average of house sizes had grown from 223 m(2) in 2001 to 318
m(2) in 2013. The findings from this study would be useful to urban
planners and government officials in helping them to make informed
decisions on urban development to benefit the community, especially
those living in areas at risk from flash flooding from heavy rain
events.

AB  - Many cities and urban areas are located in flood plains because land is
fertile and flat which is suitable for agriculture and urban
development. Rivers provide water supply for domestic, industrial and
irrigation uses; they also provide convenient means for navigation,
transportation and communication. Cities have large percentage of
impervious areas that prevent effective infiltration of rainfall into
soil. To have successful flood control and flood risk management, we
should consider not only hydraulic and engineering aspects but also
socio-economic and environment aspects. Flood management should have
involvement of various stakeholders including concerned authorities such
as urban planners, civil and water resources engineers, civil disaster
defence authorities, health and social services, etc. The best flood
mitigation measures from all main points of view - social, economic and
environmental are natural water retention measures. Natural water
retention measures cover a diversity of measures that are implemented by
different sectors or considered in different planning processes dealing
with water, food risk management, biodiversity protection, climate
change adaptation or urban planning. Some of these measures aim to
directly modify the ecosystem, while others focus on changes of practice
of economic operators. The paper presents natural water retention
measures suitable for application in urban areas. (C) 2017 The Authors.

PD  - 
AB  - The potential flood inundation extent can be estimated with flood
inundation models, which can differ in the level of physical and
numerical modelling complexity included in the solution procedure. In
recent years, several studies have highlighted the benefits of
shock-capturing flood inundation models, particularly when modelling a
high Froude number or supercritical flows, or in areas prone to the
occurrence of rapidly varying flood events, such as flash floods.
Nonetheless, decision makers are often reluctant to implement more
complex modelling tools into practical flood inundation modelling
studies, unless evidence is provided to establish when such refined
modelling tools should be used. The main objective of this study was to
determine a general threshold value of the bottom slope that could be
used by decision makers as an orientation guide to ascertain when to use
a specific type of flood inundation model. The results obtained suggest
that in torrential river basins or catchments (i.e., river basins and
catchments with a bed slope generally greater than 1%), the flood
inundation modelling should be conducted by using a flood inundation
model that include shock-capturing algorithms in the model solution
procedure.

AB  - The present study demonstrates the usefulness of remote sensing data for
analyzing the flash flood risk in Uhl River watershed situated in the
western Lesser Himalayan region. This is one of the most vulnerable
flash flood watersheds in Himachal Pradesh which, suffers heavy damages
to man-made features almost every year. In this study different
morphometric properties that direct the hydrological response and
pertinent to flash flood risk of the watershed have been used to
prioritize the sub-watersheds using weighted sum analysis (WSA) model.
The result indicates that 12.83 and 16.94 percent of the total area come
under very high and high flash flood risk respectively. In addition, the
Snyder's synthetic unit hydrograph method was employed to assess the
hydrological behavior and prioritization of sub-basins which shows that
sub-basins falling under very high and high-risk group have low lag time
and high peak discharge per unit of watershed area. This study concludes
Watershed 7 and 8 of Uhl River basin in Himachal Pradesh comes under
high priority class and is vulnerable to flash floods.

PD  - 
AB  - In this study, both human and material damages caused by different types
of flooding in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA) were determined for
the first time. Human damages (fatalities, evacuated and displaced
people) were obtained from the DISASTER database (1865-2010 period).
Material damages' estimation was obtained from the Portuguese
Association of Insurers database for the period 2000-2010. A
classification of types of flooding based on the hydrological/physical
features of the territory separating fluvial floods (slow and flash
floods) from urban flooding (related and unrelated to the ancient
natural drainage network-FREN and FUNN) was used. Topographic maps from
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1:10,000 and 1:25,000 scales),
information from newspapers and daily rainfall data were used to define
this classification and to validate the flooding occurrences. It was
concluded that: (1) during 146 years, 131 flooding events with human
damages occurred in the LMA; (2) 120 flooding events with material
damages were registered in 1781 places for 11 years; (3) the spatial
distribution of human and material damages was very different; (4) each
type of flooding caused distinct human and material damages; (5) the
importance of each type of flooding varied over time due to human
interventions in the territory; (6) there is a clear decrease in the
mortality associated with flooding even during the extreme flooding
events. This study contributes for spatial planning and insurance
companies, allowing to define the temporal evolution and spatial
patterns of the types of flooding, as well as to understand their future
damages.

AB  - The rise in the number and intensity of natural disasters is a serious
problem that affects the whole world. The consequences of these
disasters are significantly worse when they occur in urban districts
because of the casualties and extent of the damage to goods and property
that is caused. Until now feasible methods of dealing with this have
included the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for data collection
and machine-learning (ML) techniques for forecasting natural disasters.
However, there have recently been some promising new innovations in
technology which have supplemented the task of monitoring the
environment and carrying out the forecasting. One of these schemes
involves adopting IP-based (Internet Protocol) sensor networks, by using
emerging patterns for IoT. In light of this, in this study, an attempt
has been made to set out and describe the results achieved by SENDI
(System for dEtecting and forecasting Natural Disasters based on IoT).
SENDI is a fault-tolerant system based on IoT, ML and WSN for the
detection and forecasting of natural disasters and the issuing of
alerts. The system was modeled by means of ns-3 and data collected by a
real-world WSN installed in the town of Sao Carlos - Brazil, which
carries out the data collection from rivers in the region. The
fault-tolerance is embedded in the system by anticipating the risk of
communication breakdowns and the destruction of the nodes during
disasters. It operates by adding intelligence to the nodes to carry out
the data distribution and forecasting, even in extreme situations. A
case study is also included for flash flood forecasting and this makes
use of the ns-3 SENDI model and data collected by WSN.

PD  - 
AB  - This study aims to understand the hydrologic responses to wildfires in
mountainous regions at various spatial scales. The Soil and Water
Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to evaluate the hydrologic responses of
the upper Cache la Poudre Watershed in Colorado to the 2012 High Park
and Hewlett wildfire events. A baseline SWAT model was established to
simulate the hydrology of the study area between the years 2000 and
2014. A procedure involving land use and curve number updating was
implemented to assess the effects of wildfires. Application of the
proposed procedure provides the ability to simulate the hydrologic
response to wildfires seamlessly through mimicking the dynamic of the
changes due to wildfires. The wildfire effects on curve numbers were
determined comparing the probability distribution of curve numbers after
calibrating the model for pre- and post-wildfire conditions. Daily
calibration and testing of the model produced ``very good{''} results.
No-wildfire and wildfire scenarios were created and compared to quantify
changes in average annual total runoff volume, water budgets, and full
streamflow statistics at different spatial scales. At the watershed
scale, wildfire conditions showed little impact on the hydrologic
responses. However, a runoff increase up to 75% was observed between
the scenarios in sub-watersheds with high burn intensity. Generally,
higher surface runoff and decreased subsurface flow were observed under
post-wildfire conditions. Flow duration curves developed for burned
sub-watersheds using full streamflow statistics showed that less
frequent streamflows become greater in magnitude. A linear regression
model was developed to assess the relationship between percent burned
area and runoff increase in Cache la Poudre Watershed. A strong (R-2 >
0.8) and significant (p < 0.001) positive correlation was determined
between runoff increase and percentage of burned area upstream. This
study showed that the effects of wildfires on hydrology of a watershed
are scale-dependent. Also, using full streamflow statistics through
application of flow duration curves revealed that the wildfires had a
higher effect on peak flows, which may increase the risk of flash floods
in post-wildfire conditions.

AB  - Prolonged and high intensity rainfall often saturates urban drainage
systems and generates urban pluvial flooding, resulting in hazardous
flash floods. The city most affected by urban flooding in Colombia
(South America) is Barranquilla since lacks a proper storm water
drainage system. Heavy rainfall produces flash floods to quickly become
torrential streams that flow down the streets endangering pedestrians.
This research describes a low-cost early warning system (EWS) to detect
in real time the hazard level of a stream in an ungauged basin. The EWS
indicates whether it is safe or not for pedestrians to cross a flooded
street, based on certain criteria used to assess the hazard level of the
torrent. A hydrological and hydraulic model calculates the flow,
velocity and water level in all cross sections along the stream. The
model uses only real-time measurements of rain gauges and topographic
survey data to determine the hazard level. Finally, a wireless sensor
network sends the alert to a web platform and warns the community in
real time.

AB  - Torrential floods are the most frequent natural hazard events in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. The increase of intensive rains in Bosnia and
Herzegovina over last years, as a consequence of the climate changes,
has triggered many torrential floods, which have generated a lot of
damages and losses of human lives. This study was focused on development
of torrential susceptibility model using GMM Method and GIS in the Vrbas
river basin as an attempt to create a new methodological approach which
can be used on other river basins in Bosnia and Herzegovina. First, a
total of 174 torrential basins were identified in the Vrbas river basin,
as a base for creating an inventory map, which was a base map for the
assessment of torrential floods susceptibility. The GIS Matrix Method
and six influencing factors were used for generation of Torrential Flood
Susceptibility Model. Based on the obtained values of Torrential Flood
Susceptibility Model for the Vrbas river basin, 45.52% of the study
area is within strong and very strong susceptibility category. The
Torrential Flood Susceptibility Model was validated using a ``degree of
fit{''} method. Validation indicators of the TFSM show that the 80.04%
are in the category of strong and very strong susceptibility, while only
4.37% are in the category of very low and low susceptibility. This fact
suggests that used methodology based on GMM method and used influencing
factors enable delimitation of the area with high and very high
susceptibility to torrential floods into the Vrbas basin. Therefore,
used methodological approach represents a good base for future research,
and it has potential for the practical use and should be tested in other
river basins in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

T1  - Flash Flood Hazard Using Optical, Radar, and Stereo-Pair Derived DEM: Eastern Desert, Egypt

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods are classified among the Earth's most deadly and
destructive natural hazards, particularly in arid regions. Wadi
El-Ambagi, one of the largest drainage basins in the Eastern Desert of
Egypt, is frequently subjected to severe flash flood damage following
intense, short-lived rainstorms. This wadi is home to one of the few
road networks which connects the Nile River Valley to the Red Sea Coast.
At its outlet lies Quseir, one of the major coastal towns in the area.
Quseir is a developing tourism and scuba diving town, and is known for
its historical importance as an ancient port; thus, efforts are in place
to preserve the town's heritage. The lack of hydrological and
meteorological data in this region necessitates the use of a
hydrological modeling approach to predict the spatial extent, depth, and
velocity of the flood waters, and hence locate sites at risk of flood
inundation. This was accomplished by understanding the characteristics
of surface runoff through modeled hydrographs. Here, elevation data were
extracted from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and a two-meter
digital elevation model (DEM) derived from WorldView-2 stereo pair
imagery. The land use/land cover and soil properties were mapped from
fused ASTER multispectral and ALOS-PALSAR Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data to produce a hybrid image that combines spectral properties and
surface roughness, respectively. The results showed that storm events
with rainfall intensities of 30 mm and 60 mm over a two-hour period
would generate maximum peak flows of 165 m(3) s(-1) and 875 m(3) s(-1) ,
respectively. The latter peak flow would generate floods with depths of
up to 2 m within the town of Quseir. A flood of this magnitude would
inundate 217 buildings, 7 km of the highway, and 1.43 km of the railroad
in the downstream area of Wadi El-Ambagi. Findings from this work
indicate that the integration of remote sensing and hydrological
modeling can be a practical and quick approach to predict flash flood
hazards in arid regions where data are scarce.

AB  - In recent decades, the Entella River basin, in the Liguria Apennines,
northern Italy, was hit by numerous intense rainfall events that
triggered shallow landslides and earth flows, causing casualties and
extensive damage. We analyzed landslide information obtained from
different sources and rainfall data recorded in the period 2002-2016 by
rain gauges scattered throughout the catchment, to identify the event
rainfall duration, D (in h), and rainfall intensity, I (in mmh(-1)),
that presumably caused the landslide events. Rainfall-induced landslides
affected the whole catchment area, but were most frequent and abundant
in the central part, where the three most severe events hit on 23-24
November 2002, 21-22 October 2013 and 10-11 November 2014. Examining the
timing and location of the slope failures, we found that the
rainfall-induced landslides occurred primarily at the same time or
within 6 h from the maximum peak rainfall intensity, and at or near the
geographical location where the rainfall intensity was largest. Failures
involved mainly forested and natural surfaces, and secondarily
cultivated and terraced slopes, with different levels of maintenance.
Man-made structures frequently characterize the landslide source areas.
Adopting a frequentist approach, we define the event rainfall
intensity-event duration (ID) threshold for the possible initiation of
shallow landslides and hyper-concentrated flows in the Entella River
basin. The threshold is lower than most of the curves proposed in the
literature for similar mountain catchments, local areas and single
regions in Italy. The result suggests a high susceptibility to
rainfall-induced shallow landslides of the Entella catchment due to its
high-relief topography, geological and geomorphological settings,
meteorological and rainfall conditions, and human interference. Analysis
of the antecedent rainfall conditions for different periods, from 3 to
15 days, revealed that the antecedent rainfall did not play a
significant role in the initiation of landslides in the Entella
catchment. We expect that our findings will be useful in regional to
local landslides early warning systems, and for land planning aimed at
reducing landslide risk in the study area.

AB  - Nagpur city is among the fastest growing agglomerations of Central
India. The city is considered to be a forerunner in sustainable
development amist the rapid urbanization occurring in India. Though,
selected under the ``smart city{''} project launched by the Indian
government, the city faces many urban challenges ineffectively addressed
by the current development plan. Haphazard and rapid infrastructural
development without any comprehensive plan is leading to urban sprawl
that compromises urban green infrastructure across the city. It excludes
utilizing benefits of nature and ecosystem services to complement and
reduce urban stress. This has led to wetland reductions, reduced water
infiltration affecting the water table and causing water shortage, flash
floods, significant loss of vegetation cover and biodiversity across the
city and increased heat island effects. These issues along with current
approach that discounts the importance of ecosystems-based approach has
put forward many challenges and a question with regard to sustaining
``green image of the city{''}. To reduce risk against uncertainties, it
is imperative to understand human-environment connections that involves
diverse values and ecosystem services provided by the natural
environment of the cities. Present study is a review of major issues
raised due to un-planned development and addresses the feasibility and
appropriateness of using the EbDRR approach. Environmental engineering
based approaches having potential to transform Nagpur City into to a
``smart city{''} can set an example for other Indian cities to follow.
This article facilitates understanding and practical applications of
ecosystem based approaches and practices to counter negative impact of
urbanization.

the systematic evaluation of the added value of the use of Earth
Observation techniques Into operational flood prediction chains. Due to
the specific geomorphology of Italy, the focus is mainly on flash floods
on small sized river catchments. Monitoring and modelling processes at
proper space-time scales in this environment raise several issues to be
solved, compared to applications in larger river basins. Here we address
some related to the suitable use of CSK imagery.

AB  - In this work, data concerning the historical series of floods which have
occurred since the 17th century have been collected from a study area
located in the southernmost province of continental Italy. Damage caused
by flood events was discussed, together with rainfall regime and trend
(for the period in which data are available) and with main modifications
due to population variations. The aim was to assess if the frequency of
damaging floods is changing, and if there is a role of rainfall and/or
of anthropic modifications of land-use on these changes. Of 150 damaging
floods analysed, 4% of the total were floods which caused damage to
people, and which mainly occurred in past centuries. Notwithstanding,
the trend of damaging floods is increasing due to the effects of floods
observed in the last decades. At the same time, the rainfall trend is
generally decreasing, as observed at a regional scale, and is not
significant enough to justify the flood recurrence increase. The
population trend is characterised by a huge increase observed in recent
decades. On this basis, the progressive urban enlargement, with no care
for drainage network characteristics and extreme floods, can be
considered as the main source of increasing risks due to damaging
floods.

AB  - Comprehensive risk assessments are essential to integrated, efficient
flood management. However, investigations concentrate mainly on
scenarios of slowly rising riverine floods and their loss assessment.
The common loss models are focused on the water level as the primary
factor determining damage, although, for example during flash floods,
the velocity might be much more important. To improve the knowledge
about flood losses and the loss-influencing factors, 1697 households
affected by the Elbe and Danube flood in 2002 were interviewed. Cases
affected by high groundwater levels, riverine floods, flash floods and
dyke breaches were identified and separately analyzed. The four flood
types show significantly different impact characteristics concerning the
factors of water level, flood duration, flow velocity and contamination.
In addition, the resulting losses differ significantly. Common loss
models tested, i.e. stage-damage curves, were as such not suitable to
estimate losses due to dyke breaches and high groundwater levels.
Therefore, new loss models should be developed for these special flood
situations.

AB  - The concept of decentralised flood protection measures is based on the
idea to localize and use the natural capability of a catchment to retard
runoff as early as possible and at several places at the same time by
means of a combination of different small-scale measures. Because common
flood protection management mostly focuses on the downstream catchment
regions, the question arises if for headwater areas any opportunities
exist to mitigate flash floods. The headwater areas of the Ore Mountains
in Germany are often one agent triggering flash floods in downstream
valleys. Against the background of severe damages caused by flash floods
in the past, the hydrological effect of small retarding basins on flood
generation was analysed for the case study of the Natzschung River. The
modelled scenarios indicate that the use of small basins has a distinct
and local impact on the reduction and time shift of peak discharge.

Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - Background: Of all drownings, 3 to 11% occur in submersed vehicles, yet
scientific study of this topic seems limited. Methods: A search was made
of digital medical, drowning, transportation, and rescue databases
regarding vehicle submersion drownings. Results: The major risk factors
include driving on ice or roadways near water, flooding of roadways or
bridges, slippery roads, curved roads, and darkness. A new definition of
a Flotation Phase (from water impact until water rises to the bottom of
side windows) defines a period when escape is easiest. Since survival
probability is highest during this period (generally the first
minute)-and then decreases rapidly-cell phones should not be used to
call for help because this will only squander the optimal window for
survival. It is virtually impossible to open a door until the vehicle is
almost completely full of water. Since there is little or no trapped
air, this period provides a very low chance of survival. Before exit,
children should be released from their restraints. Breaking windows is
difficult without a center punch or rescue hammer, which should be
visibly mounted within reach of the driver. Conclusions: Prevention
includes installing adequate guardrails, barriers, warning signs, and
road markings, or placing roadways at a greater distance from water.
Areas at high risk for flooding should have signs and public warning
systems for flash flooding should be improved. Public education should
also focus on the dangers of driving on flooded roads or bridges, and on
ice roads.

AB  - Flash-flood disasters are very rare in the Transylvanian Depression. In
the last decades just three events were signalled in the study area, all
of them during the last 10 years. The flash floods occurring in the
study area during the last decade had a significant impact on several
localities situated at the Transylvanian Depression border. Based on the
post flash-flood investigation, the present study intends to find out
the main characteristics of the flash floods and the causes that have
led to disasters in a region rarely affected by such kinds of events.
Analyzing the hydrological data, it has been seen that the maximum
intensity of the flash floods was observed in the upper and middle
basins. By comparing the unit peak discharges from the studied region
with other specific peak discharges related to the significant flash
floods from Romania, it was noticed that the events from the
Transylvanian Depression have moderate to low intensity. On the other
hand, the results showed that besides high stream power and unexpected
character common to flash floods, the inappropriate flood risk
management measures increased the dimension of the negative effects,
leading to tens of lives lost and economical damages of tens of millions
of dollars.

A1  - Mishra, Ashutosh
Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Cloudburst is one of the major natural disasters in Uttarakhand state of
India and this brings flash floods, landslides and massive destruction
of property and lives almost every year in the state. The present paper
discusses about flood and landslides which occurred due to cloud burst
and heavy downpour in between 14 to 17 June, 2013 in the state.
Uttarakhand is very susceptible to landslides and almost three fourth of
the total geographical area of the state comes under sever to high
landslide risk zone. The catastrophe started with cloud burst near
Rambara in Rudraprayag district and due to torrential and continuous
rainfall, almost all the major rivers and especially the Mandakini and
the Alaknanda swelled up. Overflowing water reservoirs of the region
catalysed the severity of the event. About one tenth of the upper
catchment area of Mandakini river swept away due to flood and landslide.
This was the deadliest hazard in 80 years' history of the state which
affected about 80,000 people. The paper reflects the nature's supremacy
over human potentials and advocates the balanced man-nature
relationship, especially in such terrains which are most fragile and
critically balanced. It suggests the judicious use of Himalayan
resources and use of environment friendly techniques in implementing the
development plan for the region.

AB  - The flood risk management is based on the application of policies and
practices in order to identify the vulnerable areas, their analysis and
evaluation, and establish the necessary measures to reduce risk to
vulnerable human communities. In this category also fall the human
settlements located at the contact between the mountain area of the
Oriental Carpathians (in Romania) and the adjacent areas, which are
often affected by flash floods. These flash floods typically occur in
relatively small catchments as that of the Sucevita river with an area
of 199 km(2). The present study focuses on the analysis of the main
factors that generate and favour the emergence of flash floods, as well
as on the efficiency of structural and non-structural measures which
were taken at the level of the communities located in the floodplain of
the river. The research is based on the investigation of local
authorities by means of questionnaires. The data processing was
performed through qualitative methods and the interpretation through
statistical methods. The results of the study highlight the need for a
proper plan regarding the complete planning of the Sucevita catchment
correlated with an effective evacuation plan for the population.

PD  - 
AB  - Short-range prediction of precipitation is a critical input to flood
prediction and hence the accuracy of flood warnings. Since most of the
intensive processes come from convective clouds-the primary aim is to
forecast these small-scale atmospheric processes. One characteristic
pattern of organized group of convective clouds consist of a line of
deep convection resulted in the repeated passage of heavy-rain-producing
convective cells over NW part of Macedonia along the line. This slowly
moving convective system produced extreme local rainfall and hailfall in
urban Skopje city. A 3-d cloud model is used to simulate the main storm
characteristic (e.g., structure, intensity, evolution) and the main
physical processes responsible for initiation of heavy rainfall and
hailfall. The model showed a good performance in producing significantly
more realistic and spatially accurate forecasts of convective rainfall
event than is possible with current operational system. The output
results give a good initial input for developing appropriate tools such
as flooding indices and potential risk mapping for interpreting and
presenting the predictions so that they enhance operational flood
prediction capabilities and warnings of severe weather risk of weather
services. Convective scale model-even for a single case used has proved
significant benefits in several aspects (initiation of convection, storm
structure and evolution and precipitation). The storm-scale model (grid
spacing-1 km) is capable of producing significantly more realistic and
spatially accurate forecasts of convective rainfall events than is
possible with current operational systems based on model with grid
spacing 15 km.

AB  - The increase in the greenhouse gas emission has had a severe impact on
global climate change and is bound to affect the weather patterns
worldwide. This climate change impacts are among the future significant
effects on any society. Rainfall levels are drastically increasing with
flash floods in some places and long periods of droughts in others,
especially in arid regions. These extreme events are causes of
interactions concerning environmental, socio-economic, and cultural life
and their implementation. This paper presents the detailed features of
dry and wet spell durations and rainfall intensity series available
(1971-2012) on daily basis for the Jeddah area, Western Saudi Arabia. It
also presents significant articles for combating the climate change
impacts on this area. Results show trend changes in dry and wet spell
durations and rainfall amount on daily, monthly, and annual time series.
Three rain seasons were proposed in this investigation: high rain, low
rain, and dry seasons. It shows that the overall average dry spell
durations is about 80 continuous days while the average wet spell
durations is 1.39 days with an average rainfall intensity of 8.2 mm/day.
Annual and seasonal autorun analyses confirm that the rainy seasons are
tending to have more intense rainfall while the seasons are becoming
drier. This study would help decision makers in future for water
resources management and flood risk analysis.

AB  - Flash-floods develop at space and time scales that conventional
observation systems were not able to monitor for rainfall, stream flow
and sediment discharge. This condition resulted in greater casualties
and tremendous economic losses. One of the regions in Indonesia affected
by the flash floods was Aceh Besar Regency. It was located in Krueng
Teungku watershed. The flash floods were recurring events, which
occurred in 1987 and 2000. The disaster reocurred on January 2, 2013 at
19: 30 P.M. with the huge impact. This study aimed to analyze the
factors affecting flash flood hazards and to obtain flash flood hazard
zones at the Krueng Teungku watershed. The method used in this study was
weighted overlay technique through Geographic Information System (GIS).
The result revealed the information about the flash flood hazard zones
at Krueng Teungku watershed as the model for the early warning. Through
the development of this model, flood forecasting capabilities in the
watershed without measuring devices can be improved. This paper provided
the review of factors that affect the incidence of flash flooding,
including the factors of peak discharge, slope, watershed shape, stream
gradient, damming, drainage density, erosion, slope stability and
reservoir volume. The information factors were expected as a
contribution for research agencies and government (Aceh Disaster
Management Agency) to guide the disaster risk reduction (DRR) activities
of flash floods. (C) 2015 National Authority for Remote Sensing and

AB  - Extreme hydrometeorological events such as flash floods have caused
considerable loss of life and damage to infrastructure over recent
years. Flood events in the Mediterranean region between 1990 and 2006
caused over 4,500 fatalities and cost over (sic)29 billion in damage,
with Italy one of the worst affected countries. The Distributed
Computing Infrastructure for Hydro-Meteorology (DRIHM) project is a
European initiative aiming at providing an open, fully integrated
eScience environment for predicting, managing, and mitigating the risks
related to such extreme weather phenomena. Incorporating both modeled
and observational data sources, it enables seamless access to a set of
computing resources with the objective of providing a collection of
services for performing experiments with numerical models in
meteorology, hydrology, and hydraulics. The purpose of this article is
to demonstrate how this flexible modeling architecture has been
constructed using a set of standards including the NetCDF and WaterML2
file formats, in-memory coupling with OpenMI, controlled vocabularies
such as CF Standard Names, ISO19139 metadata, and a Model MAP (Metadata,
Adaptors, Portability) gateway concept for preparing numerical models
for standardized use. Hydraulic results, including the impact to
buildings and hazards to people, are given for the use cases of the
severe and fatal flash floods, which occurred in Genoa, Italy in
November 2011 and October 2014.

AB  - Flash flood events are responsible for large economic losses and lead to
fatalities every year in France. This is especially the case in the
Mediterranean and oversea territories/departments of France,
characterized by extreme hydro-climatological features and with a large
part of the population exposed to flood risks. The recurrence of
remarkable flash flood events, associated with high hazard intensity,
significant damage and socio-political consequences, therefore raises
several issues for authorities and risk management policies. This study
aims to improve our understanding of the hazard analysis process in the
case of four remarkable flood events: March 1930, October 1940, January
1980 and November 1999. Firstly, we present the methodology used to
define the remarkability score of a flood event. Then, to identify the
factors leading to a remarkable flood event, we explore the main
parameters of the hazard analysis process, such as the meteorological
triggering conditions, the return period of the rainfall and peak
discharge, as well as some additional factors (initial catchment state,
flood chronology, cascade effects, etc.). The results contribute to
understanding the complexity of the processes leading to flood hazard
and highlight the importance for risk managers of taking additional
factors into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PD  - 
AB  - A framework to characterize the distribution of flood magnitudes over
large river networks is developed using the Delaware River basin in the
northeastern United States as a principal study region. Flood magnitudes
are characterized by the flood index, which is defined as the ratio of
the flood peak for a flood event to the historical 10-yr flood
magnitude. Event flood peaks are computed continuously over the drainage
network using a distributed hydrologic model, CUENCAS, with
high-resolution radar rainfall fields as the principal forcing. The
historical 10-yr flood is calculated based on scaling relationships
between the 10-yr flood and drainage area. Summary statistics for
characterizing the probability distribution and spatial correlation of
flood magnitudes over the drainage network are developed based on the
flood index. This framework is applied to four flood events in the
Delaware River basin that reflect the principal flood-generating
mechanisms in the eastern United States: landfalling tropical cyclones
(Hurricane Ivan in September 2004 and Hurricane Irene in August 2011),
late winter/early spring extratropical systems (April 2005), and warm
season convective systems (June 2006). The framework can be utilized to
characterize the spatial distribution of floods, most notably for floods
caused by landfalling tropical cyclones, which play an important role in
controlling the upper tail of flood peak magnitudes over much of the
eastern United States.

AB  - From 1970 to 2012, about 9,000 high-impact weather events were reported
globally, causing the loss of 1.94 million lives and damage of $2.4
trillion (U.S. dollars). The scientific community is called to action to
improve the predictive ability of such events and communicate forecasts
and associated risks both to affected populations and to those making
decisions. At the heart of this challenge lies the ability to have easy
access to hydrometeorological data and models and to facilitate the
necessary collaboration between meteorologists, hydrologists, and
computer science experts to achieve accelerated scientific advances. Two
European Union (EU)-funded projects, Distributed Research Infrastructure
for Hydro-Meteorology (DRIHM) and DRIHM to United States of America
(DRIHM2US), sought to help address this challenge by developing a
prototype e-science environment providing advanced end-to-end services
(models, datasets, and postprocessing tools), with the aim of paving the
way to a step change in how scientists can approach studying these
events, with a special focus on flood events in complex topographic
areas. This paper describes the motivation and philosophy behind this
prototype e-science environment together with certain key components,
focusing on hydrometeorological aspects that are then illustrated
through actionable research for a critical flash flood event that
occurred in October 2014 in Liguria, Italy.

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - We propose in this article a statistical framework to study local
disparities in the co-occurrence of extreme rainfall in the French
Mediterranean region. We employ a region-of-influence approach by
studying the likelihood of the 3% largest daily rainfall to occur
simultaneously at less than 50 km distance, when moving across the
region. Our model uses an anisotropic max-stable process allowing us to
properly represent the co-occurrence of daily extremes and including the
possibility of a preferred direction of co-occurrence. We use this
framework on a dense network composed of almost 900 daily stations
spread over a 100,000 km(2) region of southern France under a
Mediterranean influence, with data back to 1948. This density allows us
to study the spatial patterns in the co-occurrence of extreme rainfall
at fine scale and by so to characterize the main precipitation systems
leading to extremes in the region. We show in particular that
concomitant extremes are the most likely along the crest line of the
Massif Central, which is also the area where the magnitude of extremes
is among the largest. This may be of concern for flood risk management.

AB  - Las Angustias River is an ungauged stream in the Caldera de Taburiente
National Park (Spain), where frequent intense flash-flood events occur.
The aim of this research is to analyze the flood hazard at the Playa de
Taburiente. Based on the limited information available (short
time-series of daily precipitation), a statistical frequency analysis of
24 h rainfall was completed and the precipitation results were
transformed into surface runoff. To determine if the model
underestimates the flows that are generated in the basin, the
dendro-geomorphological information available was used to calibrate
results. The results of the HMS model were significantly lower. At this
point, both the rainfall data and the rainfall-runoff model were
re-analyzed to maximize the rainfall intensity values and the runoff
generated (increasing the CN value for the basin). For the 1997 flood
event, a 1250 m(3).s(-1) flood minimizes the RMSE for the disturbed tree
sample; this flow value also clearly exceeds any peak flow derived from
the rainfall-runoff analysis. It is only when rainfall intensity and
surface runoff are maximized that the peak flows obtained approximate
those associated with dendro-geomorphological data. The results
highlight the difficulties of flood hazard management in ungauged
torrential basins in mountain recreational areas (such as National
Parks). Thus, in the absence of flow records, when considering the
maximum rainfall intensity scenario may be a useful and effective tool
for flood risk management.

AB  - An operational framework for flood risk assessment in ungauged urban
areas is developed within the implementation of the EU Floods Directive
in Greece, and demonstrated for Volos metropolitan area, central Greece,
which is frequently affected by intense storms causing fluvial flash
floods. A scenario-based approach is applied, accounting for
uncertainties of key modeling aspects. This comprises extreme rainfall
analysis, resulting in spatially-distributed
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) relationships and their confidence
intervals, and flood simulations, through the SCS-CN method and the unit
hydrograph theory, producing design hydrographs at the sub-watershed
scale, for several soil moisture conditions. The propagation of flood
hydrographs and the mapping of inundated areas are employed by the
HEC-RAS 2D model, with flexible mesh size, by representing the
resistance caused by buildings through the local elevation rise method.
For all hydrographs, upper and lower estimates on water depths, flow
velocities and inundation areas are estimated, for varying roughness
coefficient values. The methodology is validated against the flood event
of the 9th October 2006, using observed flood inundation data. Our
analyses indicate that although typical engineering practices for
ungauged basins are subject to major uncertainties, the hydrological
experience may counterbalance the missing information, thus ensuring
quite realistic outcomes.

PD  - 
AB  - Even though flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards in
the Mediterranean, causing hundreds of deaths and economic losses and
despite the significant efforts of civil protection authorities of all
levels to protect human lives and assets, a critical piece of
information, that is how the general population perceives flood risk, is
not well known, especially in the Eastern part of the region. This work
uses structured questionnaires to obtain basic information on how the
population of one of the largest urban areas in Greece and the Eastern
Mediterranean understands flood risk, risk mitigation and to what degree
they take protection measures, they trust relevant institutions and they
are aware of flood warning and flood protection actions. Then, the study
examines potential correlations of the findings with respondents'
demographics.
Results show that respondents rank floods third in terms of importance
behind earthquakes and forest fires that are important risk in the
region, although the vast majority believes the risk is increasing,
mostly due to anthropogenic factors. Responses illustrate low levels of
trust in authorities and low levels of knowledge of protection actions
and awareness regarding floods, as well as low levels of preparedness,
in terms of taking private mitigation measures. Respondents'
characteristics such as age, gender, previous flood experience and
marital status are show statistical correlation with responses, as
individuals present different perception and levels of knowledge and
preparedness. Overall, the findings illustrate the need for better
education and awareness campaigns regarding flood risk and mitigation
measures.

AB  - Climate change is affecting the frequency and severity of extreme
meteorological and geo-hydrological events hitting the coastal zone of
the Campi Flegrei volcanic district (southern Italy), which is prone to
a wide spectrum of natural hazards, including volcanism, earthquakes,
ground deformation, flash floods, landslides, and coastal erosion. This
study documents the trend of flash floods affecting the town of
Pozzuoli, located along the coastline of the Campi Flegrei volcanic
area, during the 1970-2014 time period. An archive research together
with the collection of data published on news websites and social media
allowed understanding of the triggering and evolution mechanisms of
flash floods in the area, as well as the most recurrent damages.
Rainfall data collected by the rain gauge located within the Pozzuoli
watershed were also analyzed. Results of this study show an increased
frequency of flash flood events occurred in the study area. The
variation in flash flood frequency is likely not related to urbanization
changes, as no increase of the urban area occurred after the year 2000.
The observed increase of flash flood events in recent years (2000-2014)
can be reasonably ascribed to variations in the rainfall regime. Our
research provides a contribution for the understanding of flash flood
processes in the study area as well as relevant information for hazard
and risk assessment.

AB  - Pluvial flash floods in urban areas are becoming increasingly frequent
due to climate change and human actions, negatively impacting the life,
work, production and infrastructure of a population. Pluvial flooding
occurs when intense rainfall overflows the limits of urban drainage and
water accumulation causes hazardous flash floods. Although flash floods
are hard to predict given their rapid formation, Early Warning Systems
(EWS) are used to minimize casualties. We performed a systematic review
to define the basic structure of an EWS for rain flash floods. The
structure of the review is as follows: first, Section 2 describes the
most important factors that affect the intensity of pluvial flash floods
during rainfall events. Section 3 defines the key elements and actors
involved in an effective EWS. Section 4 reviews different EWS
architectures for pluvial flash floods implemented worldwide. It was
identified that the reviewed projects did not follow guidelines to
design early warning systems, neglecting important aspects that must be
taken into account in their implementation. Therefore, this manuscript
proposes a basic structure for an effective EWS for pluvial flash floods
that guarantees the forecasting process and alerts dissemination during
rainfall events.

AB  - Purpose Up to now most of the research into flash flood disaster has
examined scientific aspects of this natural phenomenon. This paper aims
to focus on the flash flood disaster scenario of Uttarakhand, a newly
created Himalayan State in India, on the basis of their severity and
mechanism so that management efforts can be mounted by the disaster
managers.
Design/methodology/approach Besides compiling the hazard- and
risk-related work done by the various research institutions and
universities the paper attempts to understand the mechanism responsible
for this natural hazard.
Findings Uttrakhand is a state highly prone to disasters. Flash floods
are disasters that are seasonal in nature and strike during a certain
period of the year in certain pockets of the state with high frequency.
Research limitations/implications The analysis is based on observations
made in the entire state.
Practical implications Awareness amongst the masses regarding the flash
flood disaster that is likely to affect them and their life support
strategy is a must for bringing forth voluntary adoption of the safety
norms.
Originality/value Armed with the information about the hazards and their
spatial distribution, the disaster managers in Uttarakhand may undertake
certain preventive and mitigative measures for further strengthening and
streamlining the Disaster Management System in the state and pave the
way for similar activities in other states of India.

PD  - 
AB  - This study analyzes trends in the extent of major floods in the lower
reach of Songkhram River Basin, one of the most important areas for
aquatic biological production in the Lower Mekong River Basin. We first
classified the time series Landsat imagery acquired at a 2-year interval
between 2000 and 2006 using the unsupervised classification method. We
then analyzed the extent of major floods through the image matrix
analysis on seasonal land cover map pairs. Additionally, we estimated
flood volumes and discharge rates for each time series. We finally
analyzed the extent of land uses that were affected by major flood
events. Accuracy assessment showed that the extent of major floods was
accurately mapped. Analysis of trends of major floods revealed that
there was a considerable variation in the extent through 2006, with the
flood decreasing since 2002. Analysis of flood risk areas based on the
2000-2004 data showed that about 3.04% of the study areas was at high
risk of being flooded. Between 2000 and 2006, about 5.5% of the study
area that are classified as agriculture and built-up land uses was
affected by major floods. Our estimates on flood volumes and discharge
rates are consistent with the data from other studies. Overall findings
suggest that accurate mapping of major floods and flood risk areas using
space and time dependent data can be important for developing protocols
for flash flood early warning and flood risk management and mitigation.
Output GIS maps and data combined with crude assumptions about water
flow will serve as the baseline data to estimate the amount of water
that flows in and out of the basin. Further research should focus on
integration of social science research to evaluate the socio-economic
impacts of major floods and identifying coping strategies of affected
communities.

flash floods and mudslides with 45 casualties, 8 missing people, and 100
injured. The NE-moving frontal system originating from a low-pressure
center in the Madeira Archipelago is not unusual for the area, but its
consequences on the island were rather extreme.
The study dwells on passive microwave sounders from polar orbiters for
the retrieval of rainfall intensity and cloud classification. Heavy
rainfall was generated by severe local convection and enhanced over the
central mountain chain. Physical cloud classification identifies the
shallow convective precipitation type lasting for a few hours around
noon and the observations confirm the numerical model results.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper develops a new numerical scheme for flash floods based on the
one-dimensional shallow water equations in channel networks, referred to
as the dual finite volume method (DFVM) scheme. The scheme uses an
upwind spatial discretization based on staggered meshes so that the
flows in multiply connected channel networks are consistently handled
without complicated treatment at junctions. The scheme is firstly
examined with a series of test cases including idealized and
experimental dam break problems to demonstrate its accuracy and
versatility. The scheme is then applied to numerical simulation of a
flash flood resulting from an earthquake-induced complete dam failure in
Japan. Channels from a reservoir to the downstream rivers are modelled
as a multiply connected channel network with non-prismatic
cross-sections, steep slopes, and bends. The computational results agree
well with the field observations and eyewitness reports. Numerical
simulation of alternative scenarios as possible cases is also performed
to analyze potential risks of the downstream area. (C) 2014 Elsevier

T1  - Improving flood preparedness using hydrodynamic levee-breach and inundation modelling: Middle Mississippi River, USA
A1  - Huthoff, F

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - There is growing concern in the United States over the `residual' flood
risk behind leveed floodplains, which is commonly assessed based on
one-dimensional (1D) river flow models. These models fail to capture the
complex flow dynamics that typically characterise floodplain inundation.
Here, we demonstrate methodologies for mechanistically simulating a
levee breach and flow into a levee district along the Middle Mississippi
River using a hybrid 1D/two-dimensional (1D2D) flow model that combines
a 1D model of the river channel with a two-dimensional (2D)
overland-flow model for the leveed floodplain. This 2D modelling
documents the complexity of flow over a large and topographically
diverse leveed floodplain, including distribution and timing of
inundation as well as the resulting public-safety threats. In relation
to safety threats, three distinct flood phases can be recognised: (1) a
flash flood phase, (2) a flow redistribution phase and (3) an
equilibrium phase. The flash flood phase presents imminent threats to
human life and safety, whereas subsequent phases determine inundation
areas and depths, and therefore infrastructure damages. 2D modelling of
levee-breach flooding provides input data necessary for: (1) specific
local evacuation and mitigation planning in the Metro East area, and (2)
methodologies for analyses of residual risk facing other levee-protected
floodplain areas.

AB  - Floods account for more than half of the global hydrometeorological
risks. Severe floods cause significant economic shocks and loss of
lives, particularly for developing countries such as Jamaica. There is
need for more information on the present and projected flood risks to
justify macro-scale planning for climate change adaptation and
facilitate the decision-making processes. In this study, a catalogue of
198 flood events occurring between 1678 and 2010 is compiled for Jamaica
and used to examine the climatology, occurrence, trends, causes and
duration of the island's severe events. The annual flood risk is
estimated to be a loss of life rate of 4 persons and estimated annual
damage of USD96.3 million per annum in 2010 values and approximately
0.84 % of GDP per annum. Macro-scale models for flood risks (deaths and
damages) are also developed using data from the flood catalogue and
maximum precipitation at the town and parish level. The models examine
the relationship between flood risks (death and damages) and extreme
rainfall depths and intensities. Future climate risks of loss of lives
and damages are predicted to increase 11 and 9 %, respectively, to 4.4
persons and USD105.2 million per annum.

AB  - Indepth study of traditional resource management practices of the
indigenous people of Uttarakhand Himalaya reveals their appreciably
advanced understanding of the causes of various hazards. Through their
continued keen observation, experimentation, innovation and
recordkeeping these people devised techniques of maximizing resource
availability while minimizing the wrath of the hazards. For ensuring
universal compliance of the rules so laid down these people relied on
social sanctions and religio -magical practices interwoven around little
tradition of the people. With weakening social solidarity in the recent
times these practices are last loosing ground and if adequate steps are
not taken for documention this rich knowledge of generations could well
be lost forever. These practices are highly relevent even today and hold
the key to minimizing losses due to natural hazards in a cost effective
and sustainable manner and are therefore required to be studied,
documented and dovetailed with modern science and technology. (C) 2015

T1  - Local flash floods in Central Europe: A case study of Poland
A1  - Bryndal, Tomasz
Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - The article focuses on the seasonality, geographical distribution, and
hydrometeorological aspects of local flash floods in Poland, in Central
Europe. Scientific articles describing local flash flood events were
studied and a database of such floods in Poland was developed and
analysed. The results revealed that local flash flood events were
usually generated by rainfall lasting less than two hours, with a mean
intensity in the range 20-80 mm center dot h(-1). The triggering
threshold for local flash floods was P = 20 mm center dot h-1. Local
flash floods may occur from April to October, with higher frequencies in
May, June, and July. The floods usually affect mountain and uplands
areas differently to lowland and basins regions, and this might be
explained by heavy rainfall distribution and topographical conditions.
The maxima of the unit discharge ( Qs) describe an envelope curve
according to the equation Qs = 47A(-0.4) ( where A is the catchment area
in km(2)). The maxima appear very consistent with envelope curves
proposed for other inland continental European countries. The authors
conclude that local flash floods in Poland are similar to those recorded
in inland continental areas of Europe, but differ from the floods in the
Mediterranean part of the continent.

AB  - Problem: The close quartering and exposed living conditions in
evacuation centres and the potential increase in vector density after
flooding in Solomon Islands resulted in an increased risk of exposure
for the occupants to vectorborne diseases.
Context: In April 2014, Solomon Islands experienced a flash flooding
event that affected many areas and displaced a large number of people.
In the capital, Honiara, nearly 10 000 people were housed in emergency
evacuation centres at the peak of the post-flood emergency. At the time
of the floods, the number of dengue cases was increasing, following a
record outbreak in 2013.
Action: The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme with the
assistance of the World Health Organization implemented an emergency
vector-control response plan to provide protection to the at-risk
populations in the evacuation centres. The National Surveillance Unit
also activated an early warning disease surveillance system to monitor
communicable diseases, including dengue and malaria.
Outcome: Timely and strategic application of the emergency interventions
probably prevented an increase in dengue and malaria cases in the
affected areas.
Discussion: Rapid and appropriate precautionary vector-control measures
applied in a post-natural disaster setting can prevent and mitigate
vectorborne disease incidences. Collecting vector surveillance data
allows better analysis of vector-control operations' effectiveness.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - The paper explores, from a householder's point of view, the
effectiveness and need for an improved flood warning system in an inland
regional city, Toowoomba, which experienced a severe flash flood in
January 2011. A survey was conducted across 75 households in four
different areas in Toowoomba. It investigated how many people received a
warning about the flash flood, how they were warned, and their opinion
of flood warning systems post-flood. The results show that no flash
flood warning was issued and the local community was completely
overwhelmed by the January 2011 flash flood event. Overall awareness of
the risk of flash floods appeared to be quite high, especially following
the January 2011 event, and the common opinion was that a flash flood
warning system in Toowoomba would be extremely useful. However, a level
of uncertainty exists, particularly with regard to who should be
responsible for providing flood warning systems. Education and home
location in the risk areas are identified as important variables
influencing opinion and awareness of flash flooding. Improved and
coordinated information together with clear lines of responsibility for
providing flood information, better lead time, and more reliable flood
warning will greatly assist in future flood risk mitigation.

AB  - This study analyzed the top 1% 24-hour rainfall events from 1994 to
2013 at eight climatological sites that represent the east to west
precipitation gradient across the Arkansas-Red River Basin in North
America. A total of 131 cases were identified and subsequently
classified on the synoptic-scale, mesoscale, and local-scale to compile
a climatological analysis of these extreme, heavy rainfall events based
on atmospheric forcings. For each location, the prominent
midtropospheric pattern, mesoscale feature, and predetermined
thermodynamic variables were used to classify each 1% rainfall event.
Individual events were then compared with other cases throughout the
basin. The most profound results were that the magnitudes of the
thermodynamic variables such as convective available potential energy
and precipitable water values were poor predictors of the amount of
rainfall produced in these extreme events. Further, the mesoscale
forcings had more of an impact during the warm season and for the
westernmost locations, whereas synoptic forcings were extremely
prevalent during the cold season at the easternmost locations in the
basin. The implications of this research are aimed at improving the
forecasting of heavy precipitation at individual weather forecasts
offices within the basin through the identified patterns at various
scales.

AB  - Understanding the torrential rainfall and its consequent surface runoff
in the Sahara is a crucial issue for better flood protection and water
management plans. This is often hampered by the lack of appropriate in
situ measurements. Even now the satellite-derived rainfall suffers from
great uncertainty. Thus, we adjusted the data obtained from real-time
satellite rainfall coverage (HYDIS) using the in situ observed rainfall
(R-obs). Hydro-morphological parameters were then integrated with the
empirical curve number (CN) approach to estimate the surface runoff in
Qena, Egypt during the 28 January 2013 flash flood event. We deduced
that the study area received a total precipitation (Sigma R-cum) of
similar to 35.6 x 10(6) {[}mm] and a total rain volume (Sigma R-vol) of
similar to 88.9 x 10(9) {[}m(3)] mainly from wadi Qena (89.8%). The
majority of the rainfalls fell at light intensity (<2.5 {[}mm hr(-1)]).
The estimated total surface runoff (Sigma Q(sur)) was 26.5 x 10(6) mm
and the total runoff volume (Sigma Q(vol)) was 66.2 x 10(6) {[}m(3)].
The total surface transmission losses (Sigma T-los) were calculated as
9.1 x 10(6) {[}mm], which represents about 25.6% of the total
precipitation (Sigma R-cum) and creates substantial opportunities for
alluvial aquifer recharge. The total surface runoff (Sigma Q(sur)) and
flood magnitude were generally low, therefore, flood influences were
restricted to the destruction of some roads in Qena but no fatalities
were involved, nevertheless. Most of the running water was contained by
El Sail Canal and poured into the Nile River. It is expected that the
applied method in this study will be helpful for our understanding and
quantification of flood hydrology and contribute to better risk
management plan in the arid and hyper-arid regions.

PD  - 
AB  - Forest-dependent indigenous communities rely on natural resources for
their livelihoods, but those are currently under threat due to many
factors, including the adverse impact of climate change. The present
study looks into climate change-related perception and adaptation
strategies of three forest-dependent indigenous communities, namely,
Khasia, Tripura and Garo in the Lawachara National Park of Northeastern
Bangladesh. Household surveys, focus group discussions, key informant
interviews, and observation methods were used to unveil the climatic
events, impacts and related adaptations. The events include the change
in temperature and rainfall patterns, landslide, soil erosion and flash
flood, heavy cold and fog, and natural calamities. Moreover, livelihood
problems emanating from these events are the drying up of streams and
wells, irregular rainfall, increased dieback and mortality of seedlings,
pests, diseases, and the attack of crops by wild animals. Likewise, the
reduction of soil moisture content, growing season and crop
productivity, landslides, damage of roads and culverts, and increased
human diseases are common. This study recognized 29 adaptation
strategies and divided them into six management categories, drawing on
their local knowledge of the natural resources and other technologies.
The study reveals that, although adaptation strategies through land use
and land cover changes are not enough to sustain their livelihoods, the
tactics help them to reduce the risk of, and increase food security and
community resilience against, climate change.

AB  - Flash flood hazard of Wador hill torrent has distressed human activities
in almost every part of Dera Ghazi Khan (D.G. Khan) City, Pakistan. In
order to mitigate such hazards, and to utilize the flash flood water in
such water-deficit area, the study identifies potential suitable sites
for dam construction with quantitative assessment resulting in capacity
determination of the designed dams. The developed methodology also
incorporates the designing of downslope water conveyance system in storm
water management model's (SWMM) environment. The efficacy of the dams
was analyzed using SWMM model's runoff and transport module by
integrating meteorological and topographic factors with the utilization
of curve number method for runoff generation and modeling. Two sites
were identified as suitable for dam construction with sufficient
collective designed capacity of approximately 27 million m(3) to store
the flashy peaks. Number of channels designed results in systematic
waterways to flow from the dam site to the outlet point (D.G. Khan
Canal). The findings may be useful for mitigation strategies of the
severe weather conditions. Similar integrated approach could be used for
mitigation of flash flood around the world.

T1  - Multivariate density model comparison for multi-site flood-risk rainfall in the French Mediterranean area
A1  - Carreau, Julie

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - The French Mediterranean area is subject to intense rainfall events
which might cause flash floods, the main natural hazard in the area.
Flood-risk rainfall is defined as rainfall with a high spatial average
and encompasses rainfall which might lead to flash floods. We aim to
compare eight multivariate density models for multi-site flood-risk
rainfall. In particular, an accurate characterization of the spatial
variability of flood-risk rainfall is crucial to help understand flash
flood processes. Daily data from eight rain gauge stations at the Gardon
at Anduze, a small Mediterranean catchment, are used in this work. Each
multivariate density model is made of a combination of a marginal model
and a dependence structure. Two marginal models are considered: the
Gamma distribution (parametric) and the Log-Normal mixture
(non-parametric). Four dependence structures are included in the
comparison: Gaussian, Student t, Skew Normal and Skew t in increasing
order of complexity. They possess a representative set of theoretical
properties (symmetry/asymmetry and asymptotic dependence/independence).
The multivariate models are compared in terms of three types of
criteria: (1) separate evaluation of the goodness-of-fit of the margins
and of the dependence structures, (2) model selection with a
leave-one-out evaluation of the Anderson-Darling and Cramer-Von Mises
statistics and (3) comparison in terms of two hydrologically
interpretable quantities (return periods of the spatial average and
conditional probabilities of exceedances). The key outcome of the
comparison is that the Skew Normal with the Log-Normal mixture margins
outperform significantly the other models. The asymmetry introduced by
the Skew Normal is an added-value with respect to the Gaussian.
Therefore, the Gaussian dependence structure, although widely used in
the literature, is not recommended for the data in this study. In
contrast, the asymptotically dependent models did not provide a
significant improvement over the asymptotically independent ones.

AB  - This paper aims at exploring the anticipation phase before a flash
flood, corresponding to the time between the first climatic signs and
the peak-flow. We focus the analysis on people's behaviors observing how
they use this period to organize themselves for facing the event. The
analysis is made through the definition of three specific scales: the
timeliness scale, an analytical scale of anticipatory actions and the
scale of human response network. Using a cross-scale and cross level
analysis enables to define different phases in the anticipation period
where different kind of environmental precursors are mobilized by the
actors in order to make sense of the situation and adapt. Three main
points deserve attention at the end: firstly, the concepts of
timeliness, anticipatory actions and crisis network scales enable to
understand differently what happens both physically and socially during
an extreme event; secondly, analyzing the precursors shows that each
level of crisis network uses different kinds of signs for estimating the
situation, organizing and reacting; thirdly, there is a potential for
improvement in observation on both social and physical processes at
different scales, for verifying the theory of the anticipatory phases.

PD  - 
AB  - Floods are major natural disasters that, in several occasions, can be
responsible for life losses and severe economic damages. Flood
forecasting and alert systems are needed to anticipate the arrival of
these events and mitigate their impacts. They are particularly important
for risk management and response in the nowcasting of flash floods. In
this case, precipitation fields are crucial and is important to consider
uncertainties coming from the observed precipitation fields used as
input data to the system. One approach to take into account these
uncertainties is to generate an ensemble of possible scenarios of
observed precipitation. The aim of this study is to investigate the
potential of a framework that applies a geostatistical conditional
simulation method to generate an ensemble of precipitation fields that
can be used as input to a distributed rainfall-runoff model to produce
probabilistic flood alert maps. The Var region (southeastern France) and
17 events are used to validate the approach. Results show that the
proposed method can be useful to generate realistic precipitation
scenarios and, ultimately, to provide information on the probability of
discharges exceeding critical flood thresholds. It can be a solution to
combine information from radar fields and rain gauges to generate
precipitation ensembles and quantify uncertainties in input data for
hydrological modelling.

PD  - 
AB  - This article presents the results of analyzing the use of dispersed
storage tanks as a low impact development (LID) alternative to mitigate
the flash flood risk in consolidated urban watersheds in Barranquilla,
Colombia. Fieldwork, rainfall and flow rate monitoring, and numerical
modeling were conducted to evaluate different scenarios combining
storage tank capacity, two types of storage operations, and different
locations by land use and watershed sectoring. These results showed that
it is possible to reduce significantly the peak flow with small-capacity
tanks distributed in the urban watershed with hydraulic structures that
divide the discharge during the peak-flow time interval. By storing
3-17% of the runoff volume, equivalent to a dispersed storage capacity
from 4 to 19 mm rainfall, it is possible to reduce the peak flow from 25
to 75%. These results demonstrate the advantages of using low impact
development for stormwater management in consolidated cities with
limited space, if regulatory policies encourage the massive use of LID
in existing buildings. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Severe storm-triggered floods and landslides are two major natural
hazards in the US, causing property losses of USD 6 billion and
approximately 110-160 fatalities per year nationwide. Moreover, floods
and landslides often occur in a cascading manner, posing significant
risk and leading to losses that are significantly greater than the sum
of the losses from the hazards when acting separately. It is pertinent
to couple hydrological and geotechnical modeling processes to an
integrated flood-landslide cascading disaster modeling system for
improved disaster preparedness and hazard management. In this study, we
developed the iCRESTRIGRS model, a coupled flash flood and landslide
initiation modeling system, by integrating the Coupled Routing and
Excess STorage (CREST) model with the physically based Transient
Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability (TRIGRS)
landslide model. The iCRESTRIGRS system is evaluated in four river
basins in western North Carolina that experienced a large number of
floods, landslides and debris flows triggered by heavy rainfall from
Hurricane Ivan during 16-18 September 2004. The modeled hourly
hydrographs at four USGS gauge stations show generally good agreement
with the observations during the entire storm period. In terms of
landslide prediction in this case study, the coupled model has a global
accuracy of 98.9% and a true positive rate of 56.4%. More importantly,
it shows an improved predictive capability for landslides relative to
the stand-alone TRIGRS model. This study highlights the important
physical connection between rainfall, hydrological processes and slope
stability, and provides a useful prototype model system for operational
forecasting of flood and landslide.

A1  - Liu, Chunlu

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Flood inundation is a common natural disaster and a growing development
challenge for many cities and thousands of small towns around the world.
Soil features have frequently altered with the rapid development of
urbanised regions, which has led to more frequent and longer duration of
flooding in urban flood-prone regions. Thus, this paper presents a
geographic information system (GIS)-based methodology for measuring and
visualising the effects on urban flash floods generated by land-use
changes over time. The measurement is formulated with a time series in
order to perform a dynamic analysis. A catchment mesh is introduced into
a hydrological model for reflecting the spatial layouts of
infrastructure and structures over different construction periods. The
Geelong Waurn Ponds campus of Deakin University is then selected as a
case study. Based on GIS simulation and mapping technologies, this
research illustrates the evolutionary process of flash floods. The paper
then describes flood inundation for different built environments and
presents a comparison by quantifying the flooding extents for
infrastructure and structures. The results reveal that the GIS-based
estimation model can examine urban flash floods in different development
phases and identify the change of flooding extents in terms of land-use
planning. This study will bring benefits to urban planners in raising
awareness of flood impact and the approach proposed here could be used
for flood mitigation through future urban planning.

AB  - This work focuses on the analysis of flood fatalities in Greece, between
1970 and 2010. To this end, the paper develops and studies a systematic
record of 151 flood-related fatalities that occurred across the country
during this period. Based on this inventory and detailed incident
reports, a database is developed, to examine the temporal, spatial and
seasonal distribution of these incidents and the circumstances under
which they occur. Analysis indicates that fatalities present a strong
seasonality but show no particular temporal trends. Fatal incidents
occur mostly during nighttime, outdoors and in rural areas of the
country. Vehicle-related deaths are the most common type of incident,
regarding the activity of victims, whereas other outdoor and indoor
types of incidents present smaller percentages. Drowning was found to be
the most common etiology of death. Males and elderly individuals showed
proportionally higher representation, indicating an increased risk of
these population groups to flooding.

AB  - A severe flash flood event hit the town of Braunsbach
(Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) on the evening of May 29, 2016, heavily
damaging and destroying several dozens of buildings. It was only one of
several disastrous events in Central Europe caused by the low-pressure
system ``Elvira{''}. The DFG Graduate School ``Natural hazards and risks
in a changing world{''} (NatRiskChange, GRK 2043/1) at the University of
Potsdam investigated the Braunsbach flash flood as a recent showcase for
catastrophic events triggered by severe weather. This contribution is
part two of a back-to-back publication on the results of this storm
event. While part 1 analyses the meteorological and hydrological
situation, part 2 concentrates on the geomorphological aspects and
damage to buildings. The study outlines the origin and amount of
material that was mobilized and transported into the town by the flood,
and analyses damage data collected for 96 affected buildings, describing
the degree of impact, underlying processes, and building
characteristics. Due to the potentially high sediment load of flash
floods and their non-steady and non-uniform flow especially in built-up
areas, the damaging processes differ from those of clear water floods.
The results underline the need to consider flash floods and their
specific behaviour in flood hazard assessments.

PD  - 
AB  - The data sets described in this paper provide a basis for developing and
testing new methods for monitoring and modelling urban pluvial flash
floods. Pluvial flash floods are a growing hazard to property and
inhabitants' well-being in urban areas. However, the lack of appropriate
data collection methods is often cited as an impediment for reliable
flood modelling, thereby hindering the improvement of flood risk mapping
and early warning systems. The potential of surveillance infrastructure
and social media is starting to draw attention for this purpose. In the
floodX project, 22 controlled urban flash floods were generated in a
flood response training facility and monitored with state-of-the-art
sensors as well as standard surveillance cameras. With these data, it is
possible to explore the use of video data and computer vision for urban
flood monitoring and modelling. The floodX project stands out as the
largest documented flood experiment of its kind, providing both
conventional measurements and video data in parallel and at high
temporal resolution.

AB  - The projected frequent occurrences of extreme flood events will cause
significant losses to crops and will threaten food security. To reduce
the potential risk and provide support for agricultural flood
management, prevention, and mitigation, it is important to account for
flood damage to crop production and to understand the relationship
between flood.characteristics and crop losses. A quantitative and
effective evaluation tool is therefore essential to explore what and how
flood characteristics will affect the associated crop loss, based on
accurately understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood evolution
and crop growth. Current evaluation methods are generally integrally or
qualitatively based on statistic data or ex-post survey with less
diagnosis into the process and dynamics of historical flood events.
Therefore, a quantitative and spatial evaluation framework is presented
in this study that integrates remote sensing imagery and hydraulic model
simulation to facilitate the identification of historical flood
characteristics that influence crop losses. Remote sensing imagery can
capture the spatial variation of crop yields and yield losses from
floods on a grid scale over large areas; however, it is incapable of
providing spatial information regarding flood progress. Two-dimensional
hydraulic model can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff and
accomplish spatial and temporal quantification of flood characteristics
on a grid scale over watersheds, i.e., flow velocity and flood duration.
The methodological framework developed herein includes the following:
(a) Vegetation indices for the critical period of crop growth from
mid-high temporal and spatial remote sensing imagery in association with
agricultural statistics data were used to develop empirical models to
monitor the crop yield and evaluate yield losses from flood; (b) The
two-dimensional hydraulic model coupled with the SCS-CN hydrologic model
was employed to simulate the flood evolution process, with the SCS-CN
model as a rainfall-runoff generator and the two-dimensional hydraulic
model implementing the routing scheme for surface runoff; and (c) The
spatial combination between crop yield losses and flood dynamics on a
grid scale can be used to investigate the relationship between the
intensity of flood characteristics and associated loss extent. The
modeling framework was applied for a 50-year return period flood that
occurred in Jilin province, Northeast China, which caused large
agricultural losses in August 2013. The modeling results indicated that
(a) the flow velocity was the most influential factor that caused spring
corn, rice and soybean yield losses from extreme storm event in the
mountainous regions; (b) the power function archived the best results
that fit the velocity-loss relationship for mountainous areas; and (c)
integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling
approach are helpful for evaluating the influence of historical flood
event on crop production and investigating the relationship between
flood characteristics and crop yield losses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

AB  - Up to now, flash flood monitoring and forecasting systems, based on
rainfall radar measurements and distributed rainfall-runoff models,
generally aimed at estimating flood magnitudes - typically discharges or
return periods - at selected river cross sections. The approach
presented here goes one step further by proposing an integrated
forecasting chain for the direct assessment of flash flood possible
impacts on inhabited areas (number of buildings at risk in the presented
case studies). The proposed approach includes, in addition to a
distributed rainfall-runoff model, an automatic hydraulic method suited
for the computation of flood extent maps on a dense river network and
over large territories. The resulting catalogue of flood extent maps is
then combined with land use data to build a flood impact curve for each
considered river reach, i.e. the number of inundated buildings versus
discharge. These curves are finally used to compute estimated impacts
based on forecasted discharges. The approach has been extensively tested
in the regions of Ales and Draguignan, located in the south of France,
where well-documented major flash floods recently occurred. The article
presents two types of validation results. First, the automatically
computed flood extent maps and corresponding water levels are tested
against rating curves at available river gauging stations as well as
against local reference or observed flood extent maps. Second, a rich
and comprehensive insurance claim database is used to evaluate the
relevance of the estimated impacts for some recent major floods.

T1  - Flash Flood Risk Assessment for Kyushu Island, Japan
A1  - Shehata, Mohammad

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Using advanced geospatial analysis technologies, flash flood risk is
assessed for the island of Kyushu, Japan. In this study, the flash flood
risk is redefined in terms of the flash flood potential index (FFPI) and
the flash flood residential hazard (FFRH). The island experiences rainy
weather, especially in the summer (June-August), when catastrophic flash
flood events have historically occurred. Studies of the surface
hydrological properties of the island are very rare and localized;
hence, geospatial techniques are most appropriate for the assessment
process. The Soil Conservation Service rainfall-runoff model was used to
estimate hydrological responses on the island. Four factors were
included in the flash flood assessment. A multi-criteria analysis was
carried out to map the FFPI and FFRH from the evaluation factors. The
results show that the highest flash flood risk occurs in the northern
parts of the island, where the soil displays relatively low infiltration
rates and relatively high curve numbers, despite the comparatively low
precipitation rates that occur there. The results indicate that soil
hydrological properties are the main driving forces of flash floods,
especially in regions with low precipitation rates. The results of this
research are consistent with previous in situ measurements of runoff
made at several sites on the island. The results also show a strong
geographic correlation with historical flash flood events on the island.
This research validates the use of geospatial analysis for large
geographic regions where in situ measurements cannot be taken due to
time or cost constraints. The results of this study provide decision
makers with the information needed to select a management strategy to
address possible future flash flood events that considers safety and
water harvesting.

PD  - 
AB  - Stormwater drainage systems in urban areas located in arid environmental
regions generally consist of storm-sewer networks and man-made ponds for
the collection and disposal of runoff, respectively. Due to expansion in
cities' boundaries as a result of population growth, the capacity of
existing drainage systems has been exhausted. Therefore, such systems
overflow even during the smaller (than the design) return period floods.
At the same time, changing rainfall patterns and flash floods due to
climate change are other phenomena that need appropriate attention.
Consequently, the municipalities in arid environmental regions are
facing challenges for effective decision-making concerning (i)
improvement needs for drainage networks for safe collection of
stormwater, (ii) selection of most feasible locations for additional
ponds, and (iii) evaluation of other suitable options, such as
micro-tunneling. In this research, a framework has been developed to
evaluate different stormwater drainage options for urban areas of arid
regions. Rainfall-runoff modeling was performed with the help of
Hydrological-Engineering-Centre, Hydrological-Modelling-System
(HEC-HMS). To evaluate the efficacy of each option for handling a given
design flood, hydraulic-modeling was performed using SewerGEMS.
Meteorological and topographical data was gathered from the Municipality
of Buraydah and processed to generate different inputs required for
hydraulic modeling. Finally, multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) was
performed to evaluate all the options on the basis of four
sustainability criteria, i.e., flood risk, economic viability,
environmental impacts, and technical constraints. Criteria weights were
established through group decision-making using the Analytic Hierarchy
Process (AHP). Preference-Ranking-Organization-Method for
Enrichment-Evaluation (PROMETHEE II) was used for final ranking of
stormwater drainage options. The proposed framework has been implemented
on a case of Buraydah City, Qassim, Saudi Arabia, to evaluate its
pragmatism. Micro-tunnelling was found to be the most sustainable
option.

AB  - Weather extremes have widespread harmful impacts on ecosystems and human
communities with more deaths and economic losses from flash floods than
any other severe weather-related hazards. Flash floods attributed to
storm runoff extremes are projected to become more frequent and damaging
globally due to a warming climate and anthropogenic changes, but
previous studies have not examined the response of these storm runoff
extremes to naturally and anthropogenically driven changes in surface
temperature and atmospheric moisture content. Here we show that storm
runoff extremes increase in most regions at rates higher than suggested
by Clausius-Clapeyron scaling, which are systematically close to or
exceed those of precipitation extremes over most regions of the globe,
accompanied by large spatial and decadal variability. These results
suggest that current projected response of storm runoff extremes to
climate and anthropogenic changes may be underestimated, posing large
threats for ecosystem and community resilience under future warming
conditions.

areas, glacial lake outbursts, failure of dams built up by landslides,
rock falls or debris flows, and overspill following the failure of water
power reservoir dams. The sudden rise and rapid fall of water levels, as
well as the high flow velocities combined with large sediment transport,

Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - A new approach is proposed to determine the distributed threshold
rainfall for flash flooding to support practical flood warning. It is
built upon a two-dimensional full hydrodynamic model incorporating
rainfall, infiltration loss and boundary resistance. Numerical solution
of the governing equations of the model is achieved under an
operator-splitting framework, the second-order
total-variation-diminishing version of the weighted-average-flux method
along with the Harten-Lax-van Leer contact wave (HLLC) approximate
Riemann solver for the homogeneous equations, and a Runge-Kutta scheme
for the ordinary differential equations of the source terms. The
applicability of the new approach is demonstrated as applied to real
flash flooding-prone areas in Hunan Province, China. The threshold
rainfall for flash flooding, resulting from rainfall of durations from 1
h to 6 h, is found to be locally less than 100 mm or even 50 mm. This
means a high risk of flash flooding in the local areas, and therefore
effective measures are necessary to avoid loss of property and life. The
present work should find general application in support of practical
flash flood warning in catchments with the necessary topography and soil
and geological data available.

T1  - Shoreline tracking and implicit source terms for a well balanced inundation model
A1  - Franchello, Giovanni
Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - The HyFlux2 model has been developed to simulate severe inundation
scenario due to dam break, flash flood and tsunami-wave run-up. The
model solves the conservative form of the two-dimensional shallow water
equations using the finite volume method. The interface flux is computed
by a Flux Vector Splitting method for shallow water equations based on a
Godunov-type approach. A second-order scheme is applied to the water
surface level and velocity, providing results with high accuracy and
assuring the balance between fluxes and sources also for complex
bathymetry and topography. Physical models are included to deal with
bottom steps and shorelines. The second-order scheme together with the
shoreline-tracking method and the implicit source term treatment makes
the model well balanced in respect to mass and momentum conservation
laws, providing reliable and robust results.
The developed model is validated in this paper with a 2D numerical test
case and with the Okushiri tsunami run up problem. It is shown that the
HyFlux2 model is able to model inundation problems, with a satisfactory
prediction of the major flow characteristics such as water depth, water
velocity, flood extent, and flood-wave arrival time. The results
provided by the model are of great importance for the risk assessment
and management. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of the study is to assess the environmental and
socio-economic impacts and risks of climate change through GIS database
management system (DBMS) on land use-informatics and
climate-informatics. The Dabka watershed constitutes a part of the Kosi
Basin in the Lesser Himalaya, India in district Nainital has been
selected for the case illustration.
Design/methodology/approach - Land use-informatics consists of land use
mapping and change diction, i.e. decadal changes and annual changes.
Climate-informatics consists of climate change detection through daily,
monthly and annual weather data for a period of 25 years.
Findings - The exercise revealed that oak and pine forests have
decreased, respectively, by 25 percent (4.48 km(2)) and 3 percent (0.28
km(2)) thus bringing a decline of 4.76 km(2) forest in the watershed
during 1990 to 2010. But, due to climate change the mixed forest taking
place of oak forest in certain pockets and consequently the mixed forest
in the catchment increased by 18 percent (2.3 km(2)) during the same
period which reduced the overall loss of forests in the region but its
not eco-friendly as the oak forest. Barren land increased 1.21 km(2) (56
percent), riverbed increased 0.78 km(2) (52 percent) and cultivated land
increased about 0.63 km(2) (3 percent) during the period of 1990 to
2010. Out of the total seven classes of the land use land cover, five
classes (i.e. Oak, Pine, Mixed, Barren and Riverbed) are being changed
dominantly due to climate change factor and anthropogenic factors plays
a supporting role whereas only two classes (scrub land and agricultural
land) are being changed dominantly by anthropogenic factors and climate
change factors plays a supporting role. Expansion of mixed forest land
brought out due to upslope shifting of existing forest species due to
climate change factor only because upslope areas getting warmer than
past with the rate of 9 degrees C-12 degrees C/two decades.
Consequently, the results concluded that the high rate of land use
change accelerating several environmental problems such as high runoff,
flash flood, river-line flood and soil erosion during monsoon season and
drought during non-monsoon period. These environmental problems cause
great loss to life and property and poses serious threat to the process
of development with have far-reaching economic and social consequences.
Originality/value - This study generated primary data on land
use-informatics and climate-informatics to integrate each-other for
impact assessment and mitigation through sustainable land use as
constitutes a part of a multidisciplinary project, Department of Science
and Technology (D.S.T.) Government of India.

AB  - Application of geographic information systems and remote sensing are a
powerful tool for the assessment of risk and management of flood
hazards. By using these techniques to extract new drainage network with
more details to prepare natural hazard maps which may help decision
makers and planners to put suitable solutions reducing the impact of
these hazards. Ras Sudr city and surrounding area had been attacked by
flash floods of Wadi Sudr and Wadi Wardan which are nearly perpendicular
to the eastern side of the Gulf of Suez, Egypt, and many infrastructures
had destroyed. GIS techniques and remote sensing are used to find the
interrelation between the morphometric parameters by using statistical
correlation to determine the area under varying flood conditions. The
results of morphometric parameters and the new data of last flood which
occurred on 17-18th January 2010 indicate that the two basins are
threatened by the risk of flash floods and Wadi Wardan is more risky
than Wadi Sudr.

AB  - Flash floods are one of the most significant natural hazards of today.
Due to the complexity of flash flood triggering factors, to prevent or
mitigate flood triggered losses, numeric model based flood forecasting
models are capable tools to predict stream water levels. The main goal
of the current research was to reproduce two flow peaks with the HEC-HMS
rainfall-runoff model and test the model sensitivity for various input
parameters. To obtain sufficient input data, we monitored soil depth,
maximum infiltration rate, soil moisture content, rainfall, time of
concentration and flow. To obtain input data, parameters were
calculated, measured in the Sas Valley experimental watershed (SW
Hungary) or optimized with the built in function of the HEC-HMS. Soil
moisture was monitored in the 1.7 km2 pilot catchment over the period
between September 2008 and September 2009. HEC-HMS had a good
performance reproducing the two events, however simulated flow time
series are highly influenced by the antecedent soil moisture,
infiltration rate and canopy storage. Outflow modeled data were verified
for two flood events (June 4, 2008 and July 9, 2009). The HEC-HMS was
over-sensitive for input soil moisture and with increasing input
rainfall and increasing outflow, larger simulation errors were observed.

PD  - 
AB  - Floods are the most common type of natural disaster, causing thousands
of casualties every year. Among these events, urban flash floods are
particularly deadly because of the short timescales on which they occur,
and because of the high concentration of population in cities. Since
most flash flood casualties are caused by a lack of information, it is
critical to generate accurate and detailed warnings of flash floods.
However, deploying an infrastructure that solely monitor flash floods
makes little economic sense, since the average periodicity of
catastrophic flash floods exceeds the lifetime of a typical sensor
network.
To address this issue, we propose a new sensing device that can
simultaneously monitor urban flash floods and another phenomenon of
interest (traffic congestion on the present case). This sensing device
is based on the combination of an ultrasonic rangefinder with one or
multiple remote temperature sensors. We show an implementation of this
device, and illustrate its performance in both traffic flow and flash
flood sensing. Field data shows that the sensor can detect vehicles with
a 99% accuracy, in addition to estimating their speed and classifying
them in function of their length. The same sensor can also monitor urban
water levels with an accuracy of less than 2 cm. Two of the sensors have
been deployed in a flood prone area, where they captured the only
(minor) flash flood that occurred over the one-year test period, with no
false detection, and an agreement in the estimated water level estimate
(during the flash flood event) of about 2 cm.

PD  - 
AB  - Automatic monitoring of alpine mass movement is a major challenge. The
presented research project shows a new approach in alert systems by
using a high-frequency RADAR. The considered alpine hazards are
torrential hazards (debris flows, mud flows, debris floods), landslides
and rock fall as well as snow avalanches. The detection system was
implemented (spring 2012) in the integral monitoring system for the
Lattenbach catchment (5.3 km(2)) run by the Institute of Mountain Risk
Engineering (BOKU) in order to prove the applicability of the RADAR in
monitoring torrential processes (e.g. debrisflows, mudflows, flash
floods, etc.). The RADAR system emits short encoded pulses and detects
the corresponding echo signals at particular time steps, along segmented
distance intervals (range gates of 25 m). The operational detection
distance in Lattenbach is about 300 m, but it could be in principal up
to two kilometers with the same accuracy. Obtained insights were not
only an idea about the magnitude of certain events but also the changing
of water levels and the flow velocity distribution. The measurement is
based on a frequency analysis of the echo signals (doppler shift), which
gives information about the mean front velocity, the distance of several
surges and the flow velocity of the river itself.

PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods pose significant hazards in urbanised zones and have
important implications financially and for humans alike in both the
present and future due to the likelihood that global climate change will
exacerbate their consequences. It is thus of crucial importance to
improve the models of these phenomena especially when they occur in
heterogeneous and karst basins where they are difficult to describe
physically. Toward this goal, this paper applies a recent methodology
(Knowledge eXtraction (KnoX) methodology) dedicated to extracting
knowledge from a neural network model to better determine the
contributions and time responses of several well-identified geographic
zones of an aquifer. To assess the interest of this methodology, a case
study was conducted in southern France: the Lez hydrosystem whose river
crosses the conurbation of Montpellier (400 000 inhabitants). Rainfall
contributions and time transfers were estimated and analysed in four
geologically delimited zones to estimate the sensitivity of flash floods
to water coming from the surface or karst. The Causse de Violsle-Fort is
shown to be the main contributor to flash floods and the delay between
surface and underground flooding is estimated to be 3 h. This study will
thus help operational flood warning services to better characterise
critical rainfall and develop measurements to design efficient flood
forecasting models. This generic method can be applied to any basin with
sufficient rainfall-run-off measurements.

PD  - 
AB  - On 10 November 2011 some small coastal basins of the Tigullio gulf and
the middle Lavagna and Sturla valleys (eastern Liguria), were hit by an
intense rainfall. Flash floods involved the city of Chiavari and shallow
landslides were triggered on the slopes, causing severe damage to
settlements and road network. Some buildings were destroyed and two
casualties occurred at Leivi, in the lower Lavagna valley.
This paper synthesizes the results of preliminary surveys carried out
few days after the event in the area most affected by shallow
landslides. The investigations, which are still in progress, have
contributed to understand the characteristics of both triggering
rainfall and landslide source areas. These achievements will be helpful
in studying rainfall thresholds, shallow landslide modeling, landslide
susceptibility and risk assessment for the study area.

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Community participation is an increasing issue in risk and disaster
management. This paper argues that interdisciplinary methods are
necessary for mapping flooding areas. On the one hand, hazards can be
quantified and mapped through deductive approaches and methods from the
natural sciences. On the other hand, hazards can also be described from
the population perspective at a local level using social sciences
methods. The methods are successfully mixed with a geographical
information system environment. In the first case, important inputs
include topographic and slope data for geomorphological mapping. In the
second case, timeline methodology can indicate temporally the most
severe floods, and a participatory map construction gives the population
the opportunity to point out the affected areas. These methods were
applied in a case study in the lower Amazon River Region in the urban
area of the Santar,m municipality. High-resolution images and remote
sensing were essential tools. Results show that nine neighborhoods have
high and moderate susceptibility areas to riverine floods. Another nine
neighborhoods are affected by flash floods. Flood mapping is the first
step in risk mapping for the sustainability of regional planning.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Copious precipitation in the Meghna Basin has remarkable consequences
for floods in the north-eastern region of Bangladesh. In addition, due
to climate change more frequent extreme precipitation may also increase
the frequency and intensity of flash floods. In this study, a hydrologic
model H08 has been applied over the basin at a relatively fine grid
resolution (10 km). The impacts of climate change are assessed by using
the super-high resolution MRI-AGCM3.2S with MB scenario through three
time-slice experiments; the base-period (1979-2003), the near-future
(2015-2039), and the far-future (2075-2099) periods. This study
investigates the spatio-temporal changes and the changes in the
frequency of precipitation and runoff with different magnitude ranges
and finds the implications for water resources management under climate
change. Results show that, (a) the projected maximum increment of mean
annual precipitation (runoff) is +23% (+34%) and +31% (+39%) during
the near-future and the far-future, respectively, (b) the projected
increment of median value of monthly discharges at basin outlet is
significantly high in wet period (May July), ranging from 38 to 44% and
25-104% in the near-future and the far future, respectively. Moreover,
the monsoonal peaks are expected to come about 1 similar to 1.5 month
earlier, which ultimately lead to higher possibility of earlier flash
flood in the future. This anticipated higher increment in peak discharge
as well as future shifting of seasonal cycle of river discharge will
have significant implications for agriculture and flood disaster
management. Findings will also contribute to enhance water resource
management in the basin and improve the design of adaptive measures. (C)

AB  - This paper presents a proposed integrated approach for flood hazardous
evaluation in arid and semi-arid areas. Wadi Fatimah in Saudi Arabia is
utilized for implementation of such an approach. The approach consists
of four stages. In the first stage, a statistical analysis of rainfall
data is performed to determine the design storms at specified return
periods. In the second stage, geological and geomorphologic analyses are
followed to estimate the geomorphic parameters. The third stage
concerned with land use and land cover analyses linked with hydrological
analysis to estimate the hydrographs. The fourth stage is related to the
delineation of the inundation area under two scenarios: the presence and
absence of the dam. The statistical analysis proved that some rainfall
stations do not follow a Gumbel distribution. The presence of the dam
reduces the inundation depth by about 10 %. The reduction in the
inundation area due the presence of the dam is about 25 %.

PD  - 
AB  - On the evening of November 10, 2014, eight rainfall-induced shallow
landslides were triggered on a slope in the lower Lavagna valley
(eastern Liguria, Italy). Most of the shallow landslides were channelled
as flows into steep hollows and reached the toe of the slope, where some
sparse houses were built. One of these landslides impacted and destroyed
a building located just at a steep channel outlet, causing two
fatalities. Damage affected also agricultural terracing as well as some
other buildings and a road running at the toe of the slope, which was
buried for long tracts by landslide deposits.
Since a few days after the landslides occurrence, various activities
were carried out, with the aim of better understanding both the
triggering and predisposing factors of landslides. These activities
included field surveys, rainfall data analysis, topographic/thematic
maps, DEM and aerial photo analyses, preliminary laboratory tests on
soil samples.
From the analyses performed, it seems that, in addition to the rainfall
characteristics of the November 10, 2014 event, the antecedent rainfall
may have played an important role as landslides predisposing factor.
Other relevant predisposing factors can be referred to slope steepness,
presence of hollows, stratigraphic and structural settings at the source
areas and lack of maintenance of terracing.
Investigations are still in progress to achieve a complete geotechnical
and hydraulic characterization of soils. Furthermore, it is also
expected to extend the analyses performed to the whole area affected by
shallow landslides. However, we believe the results of this study can be
helpful in shallow landslide modelling, hazard assessment and planning
of appropriate risk mitigation measures.

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods are distinguished from `normal flooding' by an abrupt onset
arising from intense short period rainfall. Historical information based
on pre-gauged descriptive information is used to prepare time series of
flash floods for Northeast England and Southwest England as decadal
numbers of events from 1800. The time series show a minimum in the late
twentieth century for both locations. Flash flood frequency is then
assessed for three locations in Northeast England by comparing recent
extreme floods with historical accounts: (1) an urban pluvial flood in
Newcastle in June 2012, (2) a severe flood in September 1968 on the
Cotting Burn, a small ungauged tributary of the River Wansbeck, and (3)
an extreme rate of rise in river level on the River Wansbeck in August
1994. Although there have been no comparable recent occurrences, several
flash floods of equal or greater magnitude at the same locations were
identified from historical accounts. Using the longer historical record
in conjunction with limited recent observations has advantages when
assessing the frequency of occurrence of rare events. However, these
advantages are tempered by the possibility of non-stationarity in the
historical series owing to catchment changes, from natural climatic
variability and from potential anthropogenic climate change.

natural hazards has been a matter of much interest recently. However,
there is a lack of comprehensive, high-resolution data on historical
changes in land use, population, or assets available to study this
topic. Here, we present the Historical Analysis of Natural Hazards in
Europe (HANZE) database, which contains two parts: (1) HANZE-Exposure
with maps for 37 countries and territories from 1870 to 2020 in 100m
resolution and (2) HANZE-Events, a compilation of past disasters with
information on dates, locations, and losses, currently limited to floods
only. The database was constructed using high-resolution maps of present
land use and population, a large compilation of historical statistics,
and relatively simple disaggregation techniques and rule-based land use
reallocation schemes. Data encompassed in HANZE allow one to
``normalize{''} information on losses due to natural hazards by taking
into account inflation as well as changes in population, production, and
wealth. This database of past events currently contains 1564 records
(1870-2016) of flash, river, coastal, and compound floods. The HANZE
database is freely available at

PD  - 
AB  - Climate change projections foresee an increasing number of intense
precipitation events with consequent flash and riverine floods. An
accurate and rapid mapping of these phenomena is a key component of
effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans. Earth
Observation big data such as the ones acquired by the Copernicus
programme, are providing unprecedented opportunities to detect changes
and assess economic impacts in case of disasters.
This paper presents an innovative flood mapping technique based on an
index which is computed using multi temporal statistics of Synthetic
Aperture Radar images. The index compares a large amount of reference
scenes to those acquired during the investigated flood and allows an
easy categorization of ``flooded{''} areas; either areas solely
temporarily covered by water or areas with mixed water and vegetation.
The method has been developed specifically to exploit Sentinel-1 data
but can be applied to any other sensor. It has been tested for the 2010
flood of Veneto (Italy) and the floods of 2015 in Malawi and Uganda.
Extensive qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with other
state-of-the art methods, proved the proposed approach highly reliable
and particularly effective, allowing a precise, simple and fast flood
mapping. Compared to the maps produced for emergency management for the
event analyzed, we obtained an overall agreement of 96.7% for Malawi
and an average of 96.5% for Veneto for the 5 maps presented.

important resource, especially in arid and semiarid areas. Because
rivers flood annually, most flooding research has focused on river
management. Researchers have largely ignored the resource potential of
flash floods, as they are less predictable. Here, we describe an
innovative project in which disaster management planners in a dryland
community in northwestern China treated flash floods as a resource
rather than as a threat, and helped the community to benefit from this
resource. The project produced ecological benefits (combating
desertification), social benefits (flood control), and economic benefits
(harvesting water for future use) that improved the community's adaptive
capacity and facilitated sustainable development. This example should
inspire risk managers to seek ways to transform natural disasters into
resources, thereby improving hazard management and promoting community
survival and development.

AB  - Impacts of floods on human society have been drawing increasing human
concerns in recent years. In this study, flood observations from EM-DAT
(Emergency Events Database) and DFO (Dartmouth Flood Observatory)
datasets were analyzed to investigate frequency and intensity of floods,
and flood-induced mortality, flood-affected population as well during
1975-2016 across the globe. Results indicated that: (1) occurrence rate
of floods, flood-induced mortality and flood-affected population were
generally increasing globally. However, flood-induced mortality and
flood-affected people per flood event were in slight decrease,
indicating that flood-induced mortality and flood-affected people due to
increased floods exceeded those by individual flood event; (2) annual
variation of mortality per flood event is highly related to floods with
higher intensity. Specifically, the flood frequency and flood-induced
mortality are the largest in Asia, specifically in China, India,
Indonesia and Philippine; while significantly increased flood-affected
population and mean annual mortality was detected in China, USA and
Australia; (3) tropical cyclones (TC) are closely related to
flood-induced mortality in parts of the countries along the western
coast of the oceans. The frequency of channel floods in these regions is
the largest and large proportion of flood-induced deaths and the highest
flood-induced mortality can be attributed to TC-induced flash floods;
(4) Population density and GDP per unit area are in significantly
positive correlation with the number of flood-related victims per unit
area, number of deaths and economic losses with exception of low-income
countries. However, the flood-affected population and flood-induced
mortality increase with decrease of per capita GDP; while the per capita
economic loss increases with the increase of per capita GDP, indicating
that the higher the population density and GDP per unit for a region,
the higher sensitivity of this area to flood hazards. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Y1  - 2003///
PD  - 
AB  - The Cairns region, on the north tropical coast of Queensland, forms part
of the wettest area in Australia, with mean annual rainfalls of 2,000 to
4,000 mm. During the summer and early autumn months, intense rainfalls
associated with cyclones and other tropical weather influences persist
for several days, and can produce severe flooding in the Barron,
Mulgrave and Russell Rivers and smaller drainage systems. There is often
some loss of life and the damage to buildings, transport infrastructure,
sugar cane and other agricultural crops can easily exceed $100 million.
Very high intensity rainfalls over shorter periods, only a few hours,
also present a significant urban flash flood risk, as happened at
Townsville City, some 300 km to the south of Cairns, in January 1998.
Despite the use of good floodplain management practices in recent
decades, the combined risk of severe river floods and urban drainage
floods is relatively high when compared with the other more damaging,
but less frequent, natural hazards.

AB  - Investigations into hydrogeomorphological hazards in the Qinling
Mountains were conducted by consideration of orographic characteristics
and climatic fluctuations. Climatic-orographic-hydrologic processes in
the Qinling Mountains were assessed through model simulation from
proposed hydrodynamic gradient model and hydrological hazard index model
combined with MM5 model (PSU/NCAR, 2005) and HEC-HMS/RAS (USACE, 2008)
model. Results show that climate change is key contributor to flood
extreme events, and the Qinling Mountains has increased risk of
rainstorm-flood extreme events. The hydrogeomorphological gradient has
strong north south gradient distribution due to orographic effects of
the Qinling Mountains. Climate change impacts on hydrogeomorphological
processes are dominated by short and severe rainstorms. High-frequency
heavy rain regions are located in steep topographic gradients, such as
the north south valleys and windward slopes of higher elevations in the
Qinling Mountains. The hydrogeomorphological consequences intensify the
occurrence of localized extreme flash floods and accelerated erosion,
altering flooding routing in the upper Hanjiang River basin. Flood
routing is likely to be controlled by topographic rainfall for shorter
periods (5-year and 10-year), and by climate change for longer periods
(50-year and 100-year). Rainstorms and sediment gravity accumulation are
the main causes of hazards. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

T1  - Optimal Rainfall Estimation by Considering Elevation in the Han River Basin, South Korea

Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - More than 70% of South Korea has mountainous terrain, which leads to
significant spatiotemporal variability of rainfall. The country is
exposed to the risk of flash floods owing to orographic rainfall.
Rainfall observations are important in mountainous regions because flood
control measures depend strongly on rainfall data. In particular, radar
rainfall data are useful in these regions because of the limitations of
rain gauges. However, radar rainfall data include errors despite the
development of improved estimation techniques for their calculation.
Further, the radar does not provide accurate data during heavy rainfall
in mountainous areas. This study presents a radar rainfall adjustment
method that considers the elevation in mountainous regions. Gauge
rainfall and radar rainfall field data are modified by using
standardized ordinary cokriging considering the elevation, and the
conditional merging technique is used for combining the two types of
data. For evaluating the proposed technique, the Han River basin was
selected; a high correlation between rainfall and elevation can be seen
in this basin. Further, the proposed technique was compared with the
mean field bias and original conditional merging techniques. Comparison
with kriged rainfall showed that the proposed method has a lesser
tendency to oversmooth the rainfall distribution when compared with the
other methods, and the optimal mean areal rainfall is very similar to
the value obtained using gauges. It reveals that the proposed method can
be applied to an area with significantly varying elevation, such as the
Han River basin, to obtain radar rainfall data of high accuracy.

T1  - The chronology and the hydrometeorology of catastrophic floods on Dartmoor, South West England
A1  - Foulds, S A

A1  - Brewer, P A
Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - Extreme floods are the most widespread and often the most fatal type of
natural hazard experienced in Europe, particularly in upland and
mountainous areas. These flash flood' type events are particularly
dangerous because extreme rainfall totals in a short space of time can
lead to very high flow velocities and little or no time for flood
warning. Given the danger posed by extreme floods, there are concerns
that catastrophic hydrometeorological events could become more frequent
in a warming world. However, analysis of longer term flood frequency is
often limited by the use of short instrumental flow records (last
30-40years) that do not adequately cover alternating flood-rich and
flood-poor periods over the last 2 to 3 centuries. In contrast, this
research extends the upland flood series of South West England
(Dartmoor) back to ca AD 1800 using lichenometry. Results show that the
period 1820 to mid-1940s was characterized by widespread flooding, with
particularly large and frequent events in the mid-to-late 19th and early
20th centuries. Since ca 1850 to 1900, there has been a general decline
in flood magnitude that was particularly marked after the
1930s/mid-1940s. Local meteorological records show that: (1) historical
flood-rich periods on Dartmoor were associated with high annual,
seasonal and daily rainfall totals in the last quarter of the 19th
century and between 1910 and 1946, related to sub-decadal variability of
the North Atlantic Oscillation and receipt of cyclonic and southerly
weather types over the southwest peninsula; and (2) the incidence of
heavy daily rainfall declined notably after 1946, similar to sedimentary
archives of flooding. The peak period of flooding on Dartmoor predates
the beginning of gauged flow records, which has practical implications
for understanding and managing flood risk on rivers that drain Dartmoor.

AB  - This paper deals with the presentation of a flood warning system (GFWS)
developed for the specific characteristics of the Guadalhorce basin
(3,200 km(2), SE of Spain), which is poorly gauged and often affected by
flash and plain floods. Its complementarity with the European flood
alert system (EFAS) has also been studied. At a lower resolution, EFAS
is able to provide a flood forecast several days in advance. The GFWS is
adapted to the use of distributed rainfall maps (such as radar rainfall
estimates), and discharge forecasts are computed using a distributed
rainfall-runoff model. Due to the lack of flow measurements, the model
parameters calibrated on a small watershed have been transferred in most
of the basin area. The system is oriented to provide distributed
warnings and fulfills the requirements of ungauged basins. This work
reports on the performance of the system on two recent rainfall events
that caused several inundations. These results show how the GFWS
performed well and was able to forecast the location and timing of
flooding. It demonstrates that despite its limitations, a simple
rainfall-runoff model and a relatively simple calibration could be
useful for event risk management. Moreover, with low resolution and long
anticipation, EFAS appears as a good complement tool to improve flood
forecasting and compensate for the short lead times of the GFWS.

AB  - The climatology of Colorado's historical extreme precipitation events
shows a remarkable degree of seasonal and regional variability. Analysis
of the largest historical daily precipitation totals at COOP stations
across Colorado by season indicates that the largest recorded daily
precipitation totals have ranged from less than 60 mm day(-1) in some
areas to more than 250 mm day(-1) in others. East of the Continental
Divide, winter events are rarely among the top 10 events at a given
site, but spring events dominate in and near the foothills; summer
events are most common across the lower-elevation eastern plains, while
fall events are most typical for the lower elevations west of the
Divide. The seasonal signal in Colorado's central mountains is complex;
high-elevation intense precipitation events have occurred in all months
of the year, including summer, when precipitation is more likely to be
liquid (as opposed to snow), which poses more of an instantaneous flood
risk. Notably, the historic Colorado Front Range daily rainfall totals
that contributed to the damaging floods in September 2013 occurred
outside of that region's typical season for most extreme precipitation
(spring-summer). That event and many others highlight the fact that
extreme precipitation in Colorado has occurred historically during all
seasons and at all elevations, emphasizing a year-round statewide risk.

AB  - Mechanisms generating floods are reviewed and next discussed with regard
to the Upper Vistula Basin. Here, floods typically result from (i)
moderate-intensity rain that lasts a few days over a large area and
drives large-scale flooding, or (ii) high-intensity, short-lasting
convective rain causing local flash floods. Outside the mountain part of
the basin, especially in the San River catchment, floods are also caused
by intensive snowmelt. Interpretation of climate track in flood
generation is presented, based on the analysis of observation records
from the last six decades and projections for the future. Catchment and
river changes affecting the conditions of flood generation are next
considered for the last 130 years. They comprise changes regulating
flood runoff (catchment reforestation and dam reservoirs construction),
changes reducing floodwater storage and accelerating flood runoff
(channel regulation, flood embankments, river incision, and permanent
impoundment of the Upper Vistula for navigation purposes), as well as
the expansion of riparian forests increasing large wood recruitment to
channels during floods.

AB  - Damages caused by flash floods hazards are an increasing phenomenon,
especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Thus, the need to evaluate these
areas based on their flash flood risk using maps and hydrological models
is also becoming more important. For ungauged watersheds a tentative
analysis can be carried out based on the geomorphometric characteristics
of the terrain. To process regions with larger watersheds, where perhaps
hundreds of watersheds have to be delineated, processed and classified,
the overall process need to be automated. GIS packages such as ESRI's
ArcGIS offer a number of sophisticated tools that help regarding such
analysis. Yet there are still gaps and pitfalls that need to be
considered if the tools are combined into a geoprocessing model to
automate the complete assessment workflow. These gaps include issues
such as i) assigning stream order according to Strahler theory, ii)
calculating the threshold value for the stream network extraction, and
iii) determining the pour points for each of the nodes of the Strahler
ordered stream network. In this study a complete automated workflow
based on ArcGIS Model Builder using standard tools will be introduced
and discussed. Some additional tools have been implemented to complete
the overall workflow. These tools have been programmed using Python and
Java in the context of ArcObjects. The workflow has been applied to
digital data from the southwestern Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. An optimum
threshold value has been selected to optimize drainage configuration by
statistically comparing all of the extracted stream configuration
results from DEM with the available reference data from topographic
maps. The code has succeeded in estimating the correct ranking of
specific stream orders in an automatic manner without additional manual
steps. As a result, the code has proven to save time and efforts; hence
it's considered a very useful tool for processing large catchment
basins. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Flash flooding is often caused by sub-hourly rainfall extremes. Here, we
examine southern UK sub-hourly 10 min rainfall from Met Office
state-of-the-art convective-permitting model simulations for the present
and future climate. Observational studies have shown that the duration
of rainfall can decrease with temperature in summer in some regions. The
duration decrease coincides with an intensification of sub-hourly
rainfall extremes. This suggests that rainfall duration and sub-hourly
rainfall intensity may change in future under climate change with
important implications for future changes in flash flooding risk. The
simulations show clear intensification of sub-hourly rainfall, but we
fail to detect any decrease in rainfall duration. In fact, model results
suggest the opposite with a slight (probably insignificant) lengthening
of both extreme and non-extreme rainfall events in the future. The
lengthening is driven by rainfall intensification without clear changes
in the shape of the event profile. Other metrics are also examined,
including the relationship between intense 10 min rainfall and
temperature, and return levels changes; all are consistent with results
found for hourly rainfall. No evaluation of model performance at the
sub-hourly timescale is possible, highlighting the need for high-quality
sub-hourly observations. Such sub-hourly observations will advance our
understanding of the future risks of flash flooding.

T1  - Flash floods in Mediterranean ephemeral streams in Valencia Region (Spain)
A1  - Camarasa-Belmonte, Ana M
Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Ephemeral streams are typical Mediterranean fluvial systems with high
risk of flash flooding, and few data are available about these systems
in most locales. However, the SAIH network (Automatic Hydrological
Information Systems) of the Jucar River Water Authority has been
providing detailed information about ephemeral streams in Spain every 5
min since 1988. Using these data, we evaluated the processes of
rainfall-runoff conversion and flood generation in five Mediterranean
ephemeral streams ranging in size from 25 to 450 km(2). To provide a
general framework for hydrological analysis, the study included 142
flash flood events registered between 1989 and 2007. A more detailed
analysis was conducted for the Carraixet Basin under the dry antecedent
moisture condition (AMC I) to evaluate the influence of rainfall on the
basin's response. A simple index called Momentum of Maximum Intensity
(MMI) was developed to describe the influence of rainfall intensity on
hydrograph. Correlations between the main indicators of precipitation
and flow also were assessed. Results showed that flash floods were
generally generated by average accumulated rainfall of around 100 mm at
high intensities that could exceed 300 mm/h. Initial abstractions and
average water losses during the rainfall-runoff conversion processes
were very important (runoff coefficients of 6% and runoff thresholds of
62 mm). No correlation was found between initial abstractions (I-a)
calculated from the basin characteristics and runoff thresholds (P-0)
empirically obtained, which create some doubts about the validity of I-a
method for predicting floods in ephemeral streams. Accumulated rainfall
was very important for flood volume, peak flow and water balance
indicators, whereas intensity indicators were more related to the
response times of the basins. Rainfall intensity variables influenced
lag time. Accumulated rainfall, in combination with high reduced mean
intensity and low persistence, were a good predictor for high peak flow.
Finally, the analysis revealed two types of events. The first type,
typical of summer and early autumn, consists of fast events
characterized by intense rainfall concentrated at the beginning of the
storm and high values of persistence and irregularity. The basin
responds quickly and generates hydrographs that resemble the pattern of
rain. The second type, representative of winter and spring, corresponds
to less intense events. Although they accumulate more rain, maximum
intensities are lower and occur at the end of the episode. The response
of the basin is late, and hydrographs are quite different from
hyetographs and very influenced by the basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

AB  - Urban inundation forecasting with extended lead times is useful in
saving lives and property. This study proposes the integration of
rainfall thresholds and ensemble precipitation forecasts to provide
probabilistic urban inundation forecasts. Utilization of ensemble
precipitation forecasts can extend forecast lead times to 72 h,
predicting peak flows and to allow response agencies to take necessary
preparatory measures. However, ensemble precipitation forecasting is
time-and resource-intensive. Using rainfall thresholds to estimate urban
areas' inundation risk can decrease this complexity and save computation
time. This study evaluated the performance of this system using 352
townships in Taiwan and seven typhoons during the period 2013-2015. The
levels of forecast probability needed to issue inundation alerts were
addressed because ensemble forecasts are probability based. This study
applied six levels of forecast probability and evaluated their
performance using five measures. The results showed that this
forecasting system performed better before a typhoon made landfall.
Geography had a strong impact at the start of the numerical weather
modeling, resulting in the underestimation of rainfall forecasts.
Regardless of this finding, the inundation forecast performance was
highly contingent on the rainfall forecast skill. This study then tested
a hybrid approach of on-site observations and rainfall forecasts to
decrease the influence of numerical weather predictions and improve the
forecast performance. The results of this combined system showed that
forecasts with a 24 h lead time improved significantly. These findings
and the hybrid approach can be applied to other hydrometeorological
early warning systems to improve hazard-related forecasts.

AB  - International directives encourage the incorporation of sediment
transport analyses into flood risk assessment, in recognition of the
significant role played by sediment in flood hazard. However, examples
of risk analysis frameworks incorporating the effect of sediment
transport are still not widespread in the literature, resulting in a
lack of clear guidelines. This manuscript considers a study site in the
Italian Alps and presents a hydro-morphologic model for generation of
flood scenarios towards hazard assessment. The analysis is concentrated
on a design flood event with 100-year return period, for which an
outflowing discharge is computed as a result of the river modeling.
However, it is also argued how suitable model input parameter values can
be obtained from analyses of river flows in a yearly duration curve.
Modeling tools are discussed with respect to their capabilities and
limitations. The results of the analysis are site-specific, but the
proposed methodology can be exported to other hydro-graphic basins.

AB  - The design of hydraulic structures and flood risk management is often
based on instantaneous peak flow (IPF). However, available flow time
series with high temporal resolution are scarce and of limited length. A
correct estimation of the IPF is crucial to reducing the consequences
derived from flash floods, especially in Mediterranean countries. In
this study, empirical methods to estimate the IPF based on maximum mean
daily flow (MMDF), artificial neural networks (ANN), and adaptive
neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been compared. These methods
have been applied in 14 different streamflow gauge stations covering the
diversity of flashiness conditions found in Peninsular Spain.
Root-mean-square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R-2)
have been used as evaluation criteria. The results show that: (1) the
Fuller equation and its regionalization is more accurate and has lower
error compared with other empirical methods; and (2) ANFIS has
demonstrated a superior ability to estimate IPF compared to any
empirical formula.

AB  - Short-duration extreme rainfall and flash floods are the major natural
hazards in small Carpathian catchments. Quantifying forcing rainfall,
hydrological responses and geomorphological impacts is the key to
mitigating the negative impacts of flash floods. This article focuses on
the hydrometeorological aspects of a flood event, the geomorphological
changes of hillslopes and the river valley, in the Kasiniczanka
catchment-48 km(-2) (Outer Carpathians, Poland). Results revealed that
the flood in 2014 was generated by 6-h rainstorm with a total of 95.2
mm, and the mean intensity ranging from 7.1 to 31.3 mm h(-1). The flood
peak ranged from 60 to 171 m(3) s(-1), and it was approximately two
times higher than an 0.1% flood. The unit peak flow ranged between 3.6
and 4.6 m(3) s(-1) km(-2), and the K index (which is non-dimensional
measure and allows the comparison of flood magnitudes in catchments of
differing size), ranged from 3.9 to 4.1. These two measures revealed
that this flood was among the worst, recorded in catchments ranging from
13 to 48 km(-2) in the Carpathians as a whole. The most significant
geomorphological changes were observed in unmanaged channel reaches (the
upper and middle parts of the catchment), contrary to lower part, where
the river channel was protected by a hydrotechnical infrastructure.
Flood analysis enabled the evaluation of the flood risk management
process, related to flash floods in small catchments. In this context,
some proposals to reduce flood risk level are presented and discussed.

T1  - Sensitivity of extreme precipitation to temperature: the variability of scaling factors from a regional to local perspective
A1  - Schroeer, K
A1  - Kirchengast, G
Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Potential increases in extreme rainfall induced hazards in a warming
climate have motivated studies to link precipitation intensities to
temperature. Increases exceeding the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) rate of
6-7%/A degrees C-1 are seen in short-duration, convective,
high-percentile rainfall at mid latitudes, but the rates of change cease
or revert at regionally variable threshold temperatures due to moisture
limitations. It is unclear, however, what these findings mean in term of
the actual risk of extreme precipitation on a regional to local scale.
When conditioning precipitation intensities on local temperatures, key
influences on the scaling relationship such as from the annual cycle and
regional weather patterns need better understanding. Here we analyze
these influences, using sub-hourly to daily precipitation data from a
dense network of 189 stations in south-eastern Austria. We find that the
temperature sensitivities in the mountainous western region are lower
than in the eastern lowlands. This is due to the different weather
patterns that cause extreme precipitation in these regions. Sub-hourly
and hourly intensities intensify at super-CC and CC-rates, respectively,
up to temperatures of about 17 A degrees C. However, we also find that,
because of the regional and seasonal variability of the precipitation
intensities, a smaller scaling factor can imply a larger absolute change
in intensity. Our insights underline that temperature precipitation
scaling requires careful interpretation of the intent and setting of the
study. When this is considered, conditional scaling factors can help to
better understand which influences control the intensification of
rainfall with temperature on a regional scale.

Classically named muddy floods', such hydrological hazards are
significant as they cause losses of life and significant damage on
buildings and infrastructures. However, they still remain poorly
documented. We propose here to precise their characteristics by studying
flash floods events i) at the local scale thanks to several systematic
investigations on various catchments and ii) at the regional scale using
a specific database recording 269 events on 189 catchments between 1983
and 2005. We focused on material and human damage but not on the main
triggering factors that could explain their occurrence. Results
highlight that these streamflows are characterized by sub-torrential
dynamics, with high sediment contents and time-responses to high
rainfalls (>50 nun in less than 15 h) of less than one hour. Most of the
basins (<40 km(2)) are dry valleys, i.e., permanent stream-flow does not
normally exist during normal periods. Diffusive runoff rapidly shifts to
concentrated runoff, generating high-incised gullies over short
distances. Erosive forms with a depth of several meters and a lateral
extension exceeding 10 m are observed in compact loamy soils but the
major incisions generally appear at the outlet of 1st- or 2nd-order
basins. The morphological component explains this paradox. Because of
high-slopes and a rapid steep sidedness, runoff energy compensates the
low amount of water. Thalwegs of 3rd- or 4th-order basins are therefore
more adapted to evacuate important discharges (weak slope, large
channel). Consequently, they decrease the erosive capacity of
streamflows. High specific discharges (ranging from 1 to 2
m(3).s(-1).km(-2)) and high specific stream powers (from 22 to 511
W/m(2)) are linked to major morphogenic impacts on these small-sized
basins. The final part of tins paper discusses the risk generated by
flash floods on local population. If events and damage are rarely
observed on similar catchments, they are frequent on a regional scale
with 8 to 9 events observed per year in the studied areas.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper aims to investigate a new way of calculating potential
impacts of flash floods. Mapping surface flow concentrations, using a
new metric based on a cellular automaton RuiCells, is shown to
qualitative align with observed and known instances of damage caused by
flash floods in 5 small `dry valleys' located in northern France
(Parisian Basin). The model used is driven according to a set of three
deterministic hydrological rules governing surface water flow. Numerical
simulations enable the assessment of the relations between the
organisation of thalwegs networks and surfaces for a given basin form.
An index of concentration (IC) allows detecting the confluences in
upstream of which networks and surfaces are spatially well organised. A
strong correlation between observed damage, field experiments, local
knowledge and maps of IC index exists as simulations underline many
places where flash floods induce important material or human damage and
where further surface flow concentration results in highly-incised
gullies. In rare cases no validation is possible because nobody can
confirm the degradations. Regarding these methodological investigations,
the place of land use and of such tools for assessing flash flooding in
`dry valleys' in northern France is discussed. Prospects made in other
basins also offer promising results, so such information will help risk
managers to prevent possible damage in case of future flash floods, and
contribute towards defining sensitive areas as mandated in the European
Water Framework Directive (2007/60/EC) and as is now currently being
attempted.

AB  - Forest fire can modify and accelerate the hydrological response of
Mediterranean basins submitted to intense rainfall: during the years
following a fire, the effects on the hydrological response may be
similar to those produced by the growth of impervious areas. Moreover,
climate change and global warming in Mediterranean areas can imply
consequences on both flash flood and fire hazards, by amplifying these
phenomena. Based on historical events and post-fire experience, a
methodology to interpret the impacts of forest fire in terms of
rainfall-runoff model parameters has been proposed. It allows to
estimate the consequences of forest fire at the watershed scale
depending on the considered burned area. In a second stage, the combined
effect of forest fire and climate change has been analysed to map the
future risk of forest fire and their consequence on flood occurrence.
This study has been conducted on the Llobregat river basin (Spain), a
catchment of approximately 5,000 km(2) frequently affected by flash
floods and forest fires. The results show that forest fire can modify
the hydrological response at the watershed scale when the burned area is
significant. Moreover, it has been shown that climate change may
increase the occurrence of both hazards, and hence, more frequent severe
flash floods may appear.

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - Debris flows and flash floods are often preceded by intense, convective
rainfall. The establishment of reliable rainfall thresholds is an
important component for quantitative hazard and risk assessment, and for
the development of an early warning system. Traditional empirical
thresholds based on peak intensity, duration and antecedent rainfall can
be difficult to verify due to the localized character of the rainfall
and the absence of weather radar or sufficiently dense rain gauge
networks in mountainous regions. However, convective rainfall can be
strongly linked to regional atmospheric patterns and profiles. There is
potential to employ this in empirical threshold analysis.
This work develops a methodology to determine robust thresholds for
flash floods and debris flows utilizing regional atmospheric conditions
derived from ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data, comparing the results
with raingauge-derived thresholds. The method includes selecting the
appropriate atmospheric indicators, categorizing the potential
thresholds, determining and testing the thresholds. The method is tested
in the Ubaye Valley in the southern French Alps ( 548 km(2)), which is
known to have localized convection triggered debris flows and flash
floods. This paper shows that instability of the atmosphere and specific
humidity at 700 hPa are the most important atmospheric indicators for
debris flows and flash floods in the study area. Furthermore, this paper
demonstrates that atmospheric reanalysis data are an important asset,
and could replace rainfall measurements in empirical exceedance
thresholds for debris flows and flash floods.

AB  - Due to short durations of heavy rainfalls that occurred between November
10th and 11th, 2014 the Chiavari area was the subject of a serious
geo-hydrological event determined by the simultaneous overflowing of the
Entella and Rupinaro streams.
In the lower Fontanabuona valley (Municipality of Leivi) a landslide
destroyed a building and took the lives of two people, while severe
damages to buildings and infrastructures were recorded in the Chiavari
historical center, Carasco and Cogorno.
Between 08: 00 am on November 10 th and 08: 00 am on November 11th 2014,
peaks of rainfall peaks in Entella stream catchment order of 60 mm/1h
and cumulated rainfall of 220 mm/24h were recorded. The levels of
streams were immediately elevated, highlighting a concentrated time of
less than 1 hour between 08: 00 pm and 00: 00 am when the level of the
Entella stream moved up to 7 m leading to the flooding in Carasco,
Cogorno, and in Chiavari (the Caperana district). Meanwhile flash
flooding in the Rupinaro stream resulted in water levels up to 1.5 m in
the old town of Chiavari.

AB  - Based on the daily precipitation of 16 rain gauges in Yangtze River
Delta (YRD), the spatial and temporal changing properties of
precipitation structure during 1957-2013 are investigated in the view of
consecutive rainy duration. The results show that: (1) increasing
precipitation amount can be detected in YRD while rainy days exhibit
decreasing tendency over the basin. So precipitation intensity has been
increasing in the past 57 years. (2) During the past 57 years, the mean
wet periods become shorter over most of YRD. Wet periods with short
duration show upward occurrence and fractional contribution to annual
precipitation. Being shorter, wet periods in Yangtze River Delta are
characterized by intensified precipitation, which may result in high
risk of flash flood. (3) Extreme precipitation events during 1957-2013
are more evidently associated with short wet periods and peak for 2-day
duration both in occurrence and fractional contribution. (4) An
combination of climate change and urbanization intensifies the change in
the distribution of temporal evolution of precipitation structure
towards the precipitation events with shorter duration and higher
intensity. Therefore, these changing properties are of significance to
understanding the impact of climate change and human interference on
hydrological processes and the flood prevention in the future in Yantze
River Delta.

AB  - This paper analyzes the Girona River (Spain) flash flood, occurred on
the 12th of October 2007, combining hydrological and hydraulic modeling
with geomorphologic mapping and post-flood survey information. This
research aims to reproduce the flood event in order to understand and
decipher the flood processes and dynamics on a system of prograding
alluvial fans. The hydrological model TETIS was used to characterize the
shape and dimension of the October 2007 Girona River hydrograph.
Subsequently, the flood event was reproduced using the free surface flow
module of the model RiverFlow2D. The combination of hydrological and
hydraulic models was evaluated using post-flood surveys defining maximum
flooded area and flood depths. Then, simulations with different peak
discharges were carried out to estimate the hydro-geomorphologic
response of the Girona River floodplain, through the identification of
the activation thresholds in different geomorphic elements.
Results showed that the unit peak discharge of the October 2007 flood
event (5 m(3) s(-1) km(-2)) was among the largest ever recorded in the
area, according to the existing literature. Likewise, the hydraulic
model showed a good performance in reproducing the flood event (Fit(A) =
76%, RMSE = 0.65 m and NSE = 0.6), despite the complexity of the case,
an ephemeral and ungauged river. The model simulation revealed the
existence of an activation pattern of paleochannels and alluvial fans,
which was altered by the presence of some anthropogenic disturbances.
This multidisciplinary approach proved to be a useful strategy for
understanding flash flood processes in ungauged catchments. It allowed
understanding the mechanisms governing floods in alluvial fans systems
and it represented a solid contribution for early warning plans and risk
mitigation policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is growing awareness that fast response to emergency situation
requires effective coordination among several institutional and
non-institutional actors. The most common approaches, based on
innovating technologies for information collection and management, are
not sufficient to cope with the increasing complexity of emergency
management. This work demonstrates that effective cooperation claims for
a shift from information management to interaction management.
Therefore, methods and tools are required in order to better understand
the complexity of the interactions taking place during an emergency, and
to analyse the actual roles and responsibilities of the different
actors. This paper details the design and implementation of an
integrated approach aiming to unravel the complexity of the interaction
network based on Storytelling, the Problem Structuring Method, and
Social Network Analysis. The potential of the integrated approach has
been investigated in the Lorca (Spain) flood risk management case study.

AB  - The concurrence of flash floods and debris flows is of particular
concern, because it may amplify the hazard corresponding to the
individual generative processes. This paper presents a coupled modelling
framework for the predictions of flash flood response and of the
occurrence of debris flows initiated by channel bed mobilization. The
framework combines a spatially distributed flash flood response model
and a debris flow initiation model to define a threshold value for the
peak flow which permits identification of channelized debris flow
initiation. The threshold is defined over the channel network as a
function of the upslope area and of the local channel bed slope, and it
is based on assumptions concerning the properties of the channel bed
material and of the morphology of the channel network. The model is
validated using data from an extreme rainstorm that impacted the 140
km(2) Vizze basin in the Eastern Italian Alps on August 4-5, 2012. The
results show that the proposed methodology has improved skill in
identifying the catchments where debris-flows are triggered, compared to
the use of simpler thresholds based on rainfall properties. (C) 2018

PD  - 
AB  - Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, which are
highly complex to model. The research on the advancement of flood
prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion,
minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction of the property
damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex mathematical
expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past two
decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the
advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and
cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML,
its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers
through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing
ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models.
The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the
art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most
suitable models. In this paper, the literature where ML models were
benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy,
effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an
extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The
performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth understanding
of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive
evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most
promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods.
Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood
prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data
decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported
as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML methods. This
survey can be used as a guideline for hydrologists as well as climate
scientists in choosing the proper ML method according to the prediction
task.

AB  - In the framework of AMPHORE, an INTERREG III B EU project devoted to the
hydrometeorological modeling study of heavy precipitation episodes
resulting in flood events and the improvement of the operational
hydrometeorological forecasts for the prediction and prevention of flood
risks in the Western Mediterranean area, a hydrometeorological model
intercomparison has been carried out, in order to estimate the
uncertainties associated with the discharge predictions. The analysis is
performed for an intense precipitation event selected as a case study
within the project, which affected northern Italy and caused a flood
event in the upper Reno river basin, a medium size catchment in the
Emilia-Romagna Region.
Two different hydrological models have been implemented over the basin:
HEC-HMS and TOPKAPI which are driven in two ways. Firstly, stream-flow
simulations obtained by using precipitation observations as input data
are evaluated, in order to be aware of the performance of the two
hydrological models. Secondly, the rainfall-runoff models have been
forced with rainfall forecast fields provided by mesoscale atmospheric
model simulations in order to evaluate the reliability of the discharge
forecasts resulting by the one-way coupling. The quantitative
precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are provided by the numerical mesoscale
models COSMO and MM5.
Furthermore, different configurations of COSMO and MM5 have been
adopted, trying to improve the description of the phenomena determining
the precipitation amounts. In particular, the impacts of using different
initial and boundary conditions, different mesoscale models and of
increasing the horizontal model resolutions are investigated. The
accuracy of QPFs is assessed in a threefold procedure. First, these are
checked against the observed spatial rainfall accumulations over
northern Italy. Second, the spatial and temporal simulated distributions
are also examined over the catchment of interest. And finally, the
discharge simulations resulting from the one-way coupling with HEC-HMS
and TOPKAPI are evaluated against the rain-gauge driven simulated flows,
thus employing the hydrological models as a validation tool.
The different scenarios of the simulated river flows - provided by an
independent implementation of the two hydrological models each one
forced with both COSMO and MM5 - enable a quantification of the
uncertainties of the precipitation outputs, and therefore, of the
discharge simulations.
Results permit to highlight some hydrological and meteorological
modeling factors which could help to enhance the hydrometeorological
modeling of such hazardous events. Main conclusions are: (1)
deficiencies in precipitation forecasts have a major impact on flood
forecasts; (2) large-scale shift errors in precipitation patterns are
not improved by only enhancing the mesoscale model resolution; and (3)
weak differences in flood forecasting performance are found by using
either a distributed continuous or a semi-distributed event-based
hydrological model for this catchment.

PD  - 
AB  - In this study consideration is given to the potential use of
radar-derived quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) as flash flood
guidance in the context of the Italian Civil Protection flood risk
management system. The interest in high precipitation intensities and
accumulation motivated the case study of the 26 September 2007 event, in
which a quasi-stationary mesoscale convective system brought within 3-6
h 40% of the mean annual precipitation to the wider Venice-Mestre area,
i.e. 260 mm in Venice-Mestre and 325 mm in closeby Valle Averto.
Comparison of the radar-derived QPE in the area with the rain gauge
network revealed a good correspondence for warm season rainfall, both
for daily accumulations in the longterm (about 2 years) and hourly
accumulations for the case under consideration. The long term average
radar to gauge ratio is very close to 0 dB with an uncertainty of
approximately +/- 3 dB, i.e. roughly a factor of two, slightly better
for higher precipitation intensities. For the hourly accumulations
during this very intense event the spread is similar, while the average
is slightly positive.
The locations of the rainfall accumulation maximum as detected,
respectively, by the radar and by the rain gauge network do not
coincide. Given the relatively good quality of the precipitation
estimation, it is argued that these areas effectively have received even
larger rainfall amounts, and that it is worthwhile to further
investigate the potential of radar to be used as flash flood guidance.

PD  - 
AB  - In urban areas, the impacts of flash floods can be very severe as these
regions are generally densely populated and contain vital
infrastructure. Parts of the UK have been particularly prone to serious
urban flooding in recent years, such as Boscastle in 2004. Due to
climate change, the occurrence of urban flooding is predicted to
increase in the future, which is likely to lead to increasing flood risk
to people and property in urban areas. It is therefore appropriate to
estimate potential flood risk to people and property for improved flood
risk management. This paper outlines an integrated numerical model for
estimating flood risk in urban areas. The model includes a module for
predicting the two-dimensional hydrodynamic characteristics of urban
floods and a new module for predicting the flood risk to people (both
children and adults) and property (including vehicles and buildings).
The hydrodynamic module of this model was verified against laboratory
experimental data and real flood tracks in urban areas. The integrated
model was also applied to predict the flood risk to people and property
for the Boscastle 2004 floods, with different recurrence frequencies.
The developed integrated model can be used to predict the potential
flood risk to people and property in urban areas and such predictions
can be used as a rough assessment in improving flood risk management.

m(3)/s) and Manning's equation (7000 m(3)/s). The modeled flood peak
reached Kipot at 0300 h on 21 June 2008 and the communities between 0600
h and 1000 h on June 21, at the earliest. The actual flood peak arrived
at Sitios Agbatan and Abaya between 1100 h and 1400 h on June 21, at
least 1 h earlier than the modeled arrival.
While the flash flood may have been caused by the preceding rainfall
alone (234.4 mm from 0600 h June 20 to 0600 h June 21), the
discrepancies in peak discharges and the delayed arrival time suggest
the possibility of damming and eventual breaching of the dam. Evidence
of the damming was found at the channel constriction in Kipot. A
landslide at this site was mapped, characterized, and inferred to have
completely blocked the channel and caused the damming. Implications to
flash flood risk assessment are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB  - Flash floods are of major relevance in natural disaster management in
the Mediterranean region. In many cases, the damaging effects of flash
floods can be mitigated by adequate management of flood control
reservoirs. This requires the development of suitable models for optimal
operation of reservoirs. A probabilistic methodology for calibrating the
parameters of a reservoir flood control model (RFCM) that takes into
account the stochastic variability of flood events is presented. This
study addresses the crucial problem of operating reservoirs during flood
events, considering downstream river damages and dam failure risk as
conflicting operation criteria. These two criteria are aggregated into a
single objective of total expected damages from both the maximum
released flows and stored volumes (overall risk index). For each
selected parameter set the RFCM is run under a wide range of hydrologic
loads (determined through Monte Carlo simulation). The optimal parameter
set is obtained through the overall risk index (balanced solution) and
then compared with other solutions of the Pareto front. The proposed
methodology is implemented at three different reservoirs in the
southeast of Spain. The results obtained show that the balanced solution
offers a good compromise between the two main objectives of reservoir
flood control management.

AB  - Recent attempts to integrate geographic information systems (GIS) and
participatory techniques have given rise to terminologies such as
participatory GIS and community-integrated GIS. Little has been
published about the usefulness of participatory GIS, especially for
purposes of flood risk assessment in Zimbabwe. This paper attempts to
address this research gap and demonstrates that when combined with
participatory methodologies, GIS can provide a mechanism for assessing
flood extend in flood-prone communities of Chadereka in Muzarabani
communal lands. Flood risk is increasing in the flood-prone areas in
Zimbabwe, especially in remote areas where gauging stations are
nonexistent because of lack of hydrometeorological and climate data for
these areas, historical and projected flood events cannot be assessed
through modelling. The spatial extent of the flood zone of the December
2007 flash flood event that took place in Chadereka area was mapped
using participatory geographic information systems (PGIS), as well as
the data collected through interviews that were held with key informants
and focus group discussions. Using this approach, a flood extend
assessment map was drawn by triangulating the resultant 12 PGIS maps
produced by the local community. The results of the study suggest that
if conventional GIS and flood modelling is cross checked with PGIS and
fieldwork results, the spatial characteristics of floods in ungauged
flood-prone areas can be improved and enable the profiling of floods in
Chadereka ward.

PD  - 
AB  - In the first decade of the twenty-first century, Ethiopia has been
subjected to an increased frequency of flash floods, especially in the
town of Dire Dawa. The results of international organizations studies
point to no evidence of a climate-driven change in the
magnitude/frequency of floods, though increases in runoff and risk of
floods in East Africa are expected. Flash floods are posing constraints
to the economic growth and the development process of a low-income
country such as Ethiopia, and, in order to mitigate such hazard, it is
crucial to understand the relative roles of two main factors: rainfall
intensity and land use change. This study analyses the recent trends of
rainfall intensity across Ethiopia and investigates the relative role of
rainfall intensity and land use change in augmenting the frequency of
flash flooding of the town of Dire Dawa by the Dechatu River. Results
indicate that the increase in rainfall intensity is a more important
factor than land use change in controlling the increased frequency of
flash flood in Dire Dawa.

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Flood risk assessment is generally studied using flood simulation
models; however, flood risk managers often simplify the computational
process; this is called a ``simplification strategy{''}. This study
investigates the appropriateness of the ``simplification strategy{''}
when used as a flood risk assessment tool for areas prone to flash
flooding. The 2004 Boscastle, UK, flash flood was selected as a case
study. Three different model structures were considered in this study,
including: (1) a shock-capturing model, (2) a regular ADI-type flood
model and (3) a diffusion wave model, i.e. a zero-inertia approach. The
key findings from this paper strongly suggest that applying the
``simplification strategy{''} is only appropriate for flood simulations
with a mild slope and over relatively smooth terrains, whereas in areas
susceptible to flash flooding (i.e. steep catchments), following this
strategy can lead to significantly erroneous predictions of the main
parameters-particularly the peak water levels and the inundation extent.
For flood risk assessment of urban areas, where the emergence of flash
flooding is possible, it is shown to be necessary to incorporate
shock-capturing algorithms in the solution procedure, since these
algorithms prevent the formation of spurious oscillations and provide a
more realistic simulation of the flood levels.

T1  - A hydrogeomorphic assessment of twenty-first century floods in the UK

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - The occurrence of devastating floods in the British uplands during the
first two decades of the twenty-first century poses two key questions:
(1) are recent events unprecedented in terms of their frequency and
magnitude; and (2) is climate and/or land-use change driving the
apparent upturn in flooding? Conventional methods of analysing
instrumental flow records cannot answer these questions because upland
catchments are usually ungauged, and where records do exist they rarely
provide more than 30-40 years of data. In this paper we analyse all
lichen-dated upland flood records in the United Kingdom (UK) to
establish the longer-term context and causes of recent severe flooding.
Our new analysis of torrential sedimentary deposits shows that
twenty-first century floods are not unprecedented in terms of both their
frequency (they were more frequent before 1960) and magnitude (the
biggest events occurred during the seventeenth-nineteenth centuries).
However, in some areas recent floods have either equalled or exceeded
the largest historical events. The majority of recent floods have been
triggered by torrential summer downpours related to a marked negative
phase of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) between 2007 and
2012. It is of concern that historical data suggests there is far more
capacity in the North Atlantic climate system to produce wetter and more
prolonged flood-rich periods than hitherto experienced in the
twenty-first century. Looking forwards, an increased likelihood of
weather extremes due to climate change means that geomorphological based
flood series extensions must be placed at the centre of flood risk
assessment in the UK uplands and in similar areas worldwide. Copyright

information, a clear map that delineates land subject to flash flooding
before they can approve residential development. Through the application
of spatially distributed models, the topographic wetness index (TWI) can
be determined as an alternative to the traditional approach of
delineating flood-prone areas using contours alone. The TWI provides a
more cost-efficient approach to flood determination than conventional
hydrodynamic models. This paper describes an application of the TWI
approach to a flood-prone study area in the town of Inverloch, Victoria,
Australia. The TWI proved useful in the early stages of land use
planning for residential development in Inverloch.

AB  - Whilst policy makers have tended to adopt an Information-deficit model'
to bolster levels of flood-risk preparedness primarily though
communication strategies promoting awareness, the assumed causal
relation between awareness and preparedness is empirically weak. As
such, there is a growing interest amongst scholars and policy makers
alike to better understand why at-risk individuals are underprepared. In
this vein, empirical studies, typically employing quantitative methods,
have tended to focus on exploring the extent to which flood-risk
preparedness levels vary depending not only on sociodemographic
variables, but also (and increasingly so) the perceptual factors that
influence flood risk preparedness. This study builds upon and extends
this body of research by offering a more solution-focused approach that
seeks to identify how pathways to flood-risk preparedness can be opened
up. Specifically, through application of a qualitative methodology, we
seek to explore how the factors that negatively influence flood-risk
preparedness can be addressed to foster a shift towards greater levels
of mitigation behaviour. In doing so, we focus our analysis on an urban
community in Ireland that is identified as `at risk' of flash flooding
and is currently undergoing significant flood relief works. In this
regard, the case study offers an interesting laboratory to explore how
attitudes towards flood-risk preparedness at the individual level are
being influenced within the context of a flood relief scheme that is
only partially constructed. In order to redress the dearth of
theoretically informed qualitative studies in this field, we draw on
Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to help guide our analysis and make
sense of our results. Our findings demonstrate that flood-risk
preparedness can be undermined by low levels of efficacy amongst
individuals in terms of the preparedness measures available to them and
their own personal capacity to implement them. We also elucidate that
the `levee effect' can occur before engineered flood defences are fully
constructed as the flood relief works within our case study are
beginning to affect people's perception of flood risk in the case study
area. We conclude by arguing that (1) individuals' coping appraisals
need to be enhanced through communication strategies and other
interventions which highlight that future floods may not replicate past
events; and (2) the concept of residual risk needs to be communicated at
all stages of a flood relief scheme, not just upon completion. (C) 2016

AB  - For the first time flood mortality is analysed and compared between a
Western (Portugal) and an Eastern Mediterranean country (Greece). Flood
fatalities are examined and compared in terms of frequency, temporal
evolution, spatial distribution, deadliest flood types, gender of the
victims, circumstances surrounding fatalities, and individual and
societal risk.
A common flood fatalities database was formed for the period 1960-2010
by merging the DISASTER database for Portugal and the Greek database
Individual flood cases generated more deaths in Greece than in Portugal
(excluding an outlier flash flood event in the latter). Despite some
fluctuations evidence of a gradual decrease in fatality numbers were
recorded for both countries. Since the 1980's the number of flood cases
with multiple fatalities has been gradually declining, due to changes in
qualitative characteristics of mortality. Flood fatalities predominantly
occur during autumn in Greece and during winter in Portugal.
In both Greece and Portugal flash floods were responsible for more than
80% of the total mortality. The main metropolitan areas of each country
were found to be hotspots of flood mortality; a trend connected, with
the higher population density along the coastal areas combined with the
expansion of urban fabric towards flood-prone areas.
Gender distribution of fatalities indicates that males are more
vulnerable in both countries. The circumstances surrounding fatalities
showed that fatalities occurring inside buildings have been gradually
reducing in time, while vehicle-related deaths have been rising, showing
that individuals hold an active role when they voluntarily enter in
floodwaters during a flood.

PD  - 
AB  - Storm-induced urban flooding is a global issue that causes large damages
and fatalities. Characterizing extreme rainfall is critical to urban
flood risk management. Although China's cities have been experiencing a
rapid increase in urban flooding in recent decades, there is a lack of
national-wide analysis of the occurrence of extreme urban rainfall. This
study examined the trends in extreme rainfall in 146 cities in China for
the period 1960-2014. The trends were also analysed in terms of city
size (small, big and mega cities) in two city clusters (Jing-Jin-Jin
City Cluster and Yangtze City Cluster). There was a strong spatial
variation in the trends of extreme rainfall across the country, with
negative trends in North China and positive trends in Southeast China.
Both positive and negative trends were noted for the other regions of
China. All the cities in Jing-Jin-Ji City Cluster had a decreasing trend
in extreme rainfall, with a significant decline (p = 0.03) for mega
cities. Then all cities in the Yangtze City Cluster had an increasing
trend in extreme rainfall, with a significant increase (p=0.02) for big
cities. The findings suggested that efforts to alleviate storm-induced
urban flash floods should take into account both spatial disparities in
climate and future changes in extreme rainfall events.

AB  - High accuracy models are required for informed decision making in urban
flood management. This paper develops a new holistic framework for using
information collected from multiple sources for setting parameters of a
2D flood model. This illustrates the importance of identifying key urban
features from the terrain data for capturing high resolution flood
processes. A Cellular Automata based model CADDIES was used to simulate
surface water flood inundation. Existing reports and flood photos
obtained via social media were used to set model parameters and
investigate different approaches for representing infiltration and
drainage system capacity in urban flood modelling. The results of
different approaches to processing terrain datasets indicate that the
representation of urban micro-features is critical to the accuracy of
modelling results. The constant infiltration approach is better than the
rainfall reduction approach in representing soil infiltration and
drainage capacity, as it describes the flood recession process better.
This study provides an in-depth insight into high resolution flood
modelling.

of floods is proposed. The types are long-rain floods, short-rain
floods, flash floods, ram-on-snow floods and snowmelt floods. A
catchment perspective is adopted, i.e. the focus is on the catchment
state and the atmospheric inputs rather than on atmospheric circulation
patterns. A number of process indicators, including the timing of the
floods, storm duration, rainfall depth, snowmelt, catchment state,
runoff response dynamics and spatial coherence, are presented. Based on
a combination of these indicators and diagnostic regional plots, the
process types of 11 518 maximum annual flood peaks in 490 Austrian
catchments are identified. Of the flood peaks, 43% are long-rain
floods, and only 3% are snowmelt floods, and the relative contribution
of the types changes with the flood magnitude. All process types exhibit
pronounced seasonal patterns. The flood types analysis provides useful
information for flood frequency regionalisation.

PD  - 
AB  - The second-generation radar-based flood alert system (FAS2) has been
operational for more than a decade, and provides accurate advanced
warning to the Texas Medical Center (TMC) in the Brays Bayou watershed
of southwest Houston. Over the past nine years, FAS has generally
predicted floods with average differences of 0.88 h in time of peak and
3.6% in peak flows and a R(2) value of 0.90 for the overall
performance. After years of urbanization in the watershed, the
hydrologic model as a core engine in the system has been updated with
recent routing information and loss rate factors to provide more
reliable prediction information. Recently, the system has been upgraded
into its third generation (FAS3) by incorporating a hydraulic prediction
tool-FloodPlain Map Library (FPML)-so that mapped warning information in
geographic information systems (GIS) and Google Maps can be provided to
emergency personnel in real time. In addition to briefly reviewing the
theory and design of the flood warning system for Brays Bayou, this
paper focuses on recent improvements with a summary of the flood alert
system's performance over the past years, including three recent major
events: Hurricane Ike on September 13, 2008, a smaller event on April

Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - The last 3 years have seen major developments in operational
hydrometeorology in the UK. Operational hydrometeorology is largely
concerned with real-time flood forecasting. The primary catalyst for
development was Sir Michael Pitt's review of the summer 2007 floods.
This driver, coupled with ongoing forecasting developments at the
Environment Agency and increases in Met Office capability in forecasting
rainfall, has allowed the hydrological and meteorological communities to
grow closer together, their joint knowledge being united to improve
forecast accuracy, lead time and spatial coverage. A key development has
been the establishment of the joint Flood Forecasting Centre for England
and Wales, aligned to specific recommendations from the Pitt review,
which comprises Met Office and Environment Agency personnel in equal
measure. Significant areas of development include urban surface water
flooding forecasts, forecasting in `rapid response' catchments and
longer range forecasting of potential river flooding. Each of these
developments requires the use of probabilistic rainfall forecasting.
This paper examines these developments, their impact on flood
forecasting, the drivers behind them and the benefits they bring in
mitigating floods. Looking ahead, the authors put forward their views on
the future of hydrometeorology for flood forecasting in the UK.

AB  - The historical floods that have occurred since the seventeenth century
were collected for a study area in southern Italy. Damages caused by
floods, rainfall and the main anthropogenic modifications are discussed
all together. The aim was to assess whether the frequency of floods is
changing and, if so, whether these changes can be attributed to either
rainfall and/or anthropogenic modifications. In 4 % of cases, mainly
occurred in past centuries, floods damaged people. Hydraulic works,
roads and private buildings were the more frequently damaged elements
(25, 18 and 14 % of the cases, respectively). The annual variability of
rainfall was discussed using an annual index. Short duration-high
intensity rainfalls were characterized considering time series of annual
maxima of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h and daily rainfall. The rainfall shows a
decreasing trend, in terms of both the annual maximum of short duration
and the annual amount. The population has been progressively increasing
since the sixteenth century, except during the years following the
catastrophic 1908 earthquake. The rate of population growth has been
very high since the second half of the twentieth century; the urbanized
areas greatly increased, especially following the second half of the
twentieth century. At the same time, the trend of damaging floods has
been increasing, especially since the seventies. The analysis indicates
that, despite a rainfall trend favourable towards a reduction in flood
occurrence, floods damage has not decreased. This seems to be mainly the
effect of mismanagement of land use modifications.

PD  - 
AB  - Saratel River basin, which is located in Curvature Subcarpahian area,
has been facing an obvious increase in frequency of hydrological risk
phenomena, associated with torrential events, during the last years.
This trend is highly related to the increase in frequency of the extreme
climatic phenomena and to the land use changes. The present study is
aimed to highlight the spatial and quantitative changes occurred in
surface runoff depth in Saratel catchment, between 1990-2006. This
purpose was reached by estimating the surface runoff depth assignable to
the average annual rainfall, by means of SCS-CN method, which was
integrated into the GIS environment through the ArcCN-Runoff extension,
for ArcGIS 10.1. In order to compute the surface runoff depth, by CN
method, the land cover and the hydrological soil classes were introduced
as vector (polygon data), while the curve number and the average annual

runoff depth for the two years, the 1990 raster dataset was subtracted
from the 2006 raster dataset, in order to highlight the changes in
surface runoff depth.

AB  - This study presents the analysis of flash floods triggered by an extreme
rainfall event that occurred on 7 October, 2011, over the Marzano
carbonate massif (Southern Apennines). The rainfall event reactivated
alluvial fans built up at the outlet of two mountain basins. Detailed
geological surveys carried out immediately after the event allowed the
reconstruction of the main erosion and depositional processes that
occurred both in the drainage basin and in the fan areas. The volume of
materials eroded in the basin and deposited in the fan was evaluated by
means of accurate topographic surveying and GPS measurements.
Morphological and morphometric properties of the basin/fan system as
well as the presence of human interventions and structures along the
main channel and in the fan area influenced flow propagation. The
transported materials came mainly from debris and gravels previously
accumulated along the stream beds and mobilised by the flow during the
event. No significant evidence of landslide contribution to transported
bed load was detected. Extensive damage was done to buildings, river
bank structures and agricultural crops. Despite the existence of
hundreds of similar alluvial/fan systems in the Southern Apennines, few
studies have been conducted to support adequate risk mitigation action
in these areas. Indeed, to our knowledge, this is the first study
focusing on assessing the magnitude of alluvial fan flooding in the
context of the Southern Apennines. Studies like the present one may help
determine the volumes involved during flash floods whilst providing
support for detailed flood hazard zoning and for risk mitigation
planning.

AB  - This paper presents the current state and development of a prototype
web-GIS (Geographic Information System) decision support platform
intended for application in natural hazards and risk management, mainly
for floods and landslides. This web platform uses open-source geospatial
software and technologies, particularly the Boundless (formerly OpenGeo)
framework and its client side software development kit (SDK). The main
purpose of the platform is to assist the experts and stakeholders in the
decision-making process for evaluation and selection of different risk
management strategies through an interactive participation approach,
integrating web-GIS interface with decision support tool based on a
compromise programming approach. The access rights and functionality of
the platform are varied depending on the roles and responsibilities of
stakeholders in managing the risk. The application of the prototype
platform is demonstrated based on an example case study site:
Malborghetto Valbruna municipality of North-Eastern Italy where flash
floods and landslides are frequent with major events having occurred in
2003. The preliminary feedback collected from the stakeholders in the
region is discussed to understand the perspectives of stakeholders on
the proposed prototype platform.

AB  - This paper analyses the meteorological conditions and the specific peak
flows of 24 catastrophic floods that affected NE Iberian Peninsula in
the period 1842-2000. We classify these floods according to the affected
area, peak flow magnitude, and damages. Additionally, the NOAA 6 Hourly
20th Century V2 Reanalysis Data Composites have been used to analyze the
synoptic conditions during each flood and to evaluate several stability
indices, such as the convective available potential energy (CAPE), or
the lift index.
We found a good correlation between stability indices and the season
when the flood occurred. For instance, if maximum CAPE is considered,
larger values are found for summer floods, moderate for autumn, and low
values during winter floods. We select 5 representative episodes
occurred in different seasons and areas to describe in detail the
synoptic conditions and to show the temporal evolution of the stability
indices. In one the summer floods analyzed in detail, the largest
instability, according to all the convective indices, is found. On the
contrary, the winter case shows very low values of the convective
indices, and autumn cases lay in between. During the other analyzed
summer flood instability was low but snow thaw played an important role
in producing the flood.
Regarding hydrological variables, clear differences between floods
occurred at the coast or at the Pyrenees are found. Coastal specific
peak flows are larger than Pyrenean ones, especially for small catchment
areas.
We also combine meteorological (rainfall duration, CAPE), hydrological
(specific peak flow) and geomorphological (catchment area) variables to
show that for many of the analyzed floods these variables are related:
the specific peak flow generally shows larger values when CAPE is also
large. However some differences appear depending on the season and area.
In those summer floods, where snow thaw played doesn't played any role,
either Pyrenean or coastal, specific peak flow seems to be correlated
with CAPE. For autumn floods, depending on the area different
correlations were found: Pyrenean floods seem to be a correlation
between CAPE and specific peak flows, but not for coastal ones. For
winter coastal floods we couldn't find any correlation between CAPE and
specific peak flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents an historical database of flash flood events in the
Campania region of southern Italy. The study focuses on small catchments
characterized by intermittent flow, generally occurring during and after
heavy rainstorms, which can be hydrologically defined as small
Mediterranean catchments. As the outlet zones of these catchments
(consisting mainly of alluvial fans or fan deltas) are highly urbanized
in Campania, the population living in the delivery areas is exposed to
high risk. Detailed scrutiny and critical analysis of the existing
literature, and of the data inventory available, allowed us to build a
robust database consisting of about 500 events from 1540 to 2015, which
is continuously updated. Since this study is the first step of a longer
project to perform a hazard analysis, information about time and site of
occurrence is known for all events. As for the hazard analysis
envisaged, collecting information about past events could provide
information on future events, in terms of damage and also spatial and
temporal occurrence. After introducing the issue of flash floods in
Italy we then describe the geological and geomorphological settings of
the study area. The database is then presented, illustrating the
methodology used in collecting information and its general structure.
The collected data are then discussed and the statistical data analysis
presented.

AB  - Flash floods have long been common in Asian cities, with recent
increases in urbanization and extreme rainfall driving increasingly
severe and frequent events. Floods in urban areas cause significant
damage to infrastructure, communities and the environment. Numerical
modelling of flood inundation offers detailed information necessary for
managing flood risk in such contexts. This study presents a calibrated
flood inundation model using referenced photos, an assessment of the
influence of four extreme rainfall events on water depth and inundation
area in the Hanoi central area. Four types of historical and extreme
rainfall were input into the inundation model. The modeled results for a
2008 flood event with 9 referenced stations resulted in an R-2 of 0.6
compared to observations. The water depth at the different locations was
simulated under the four extreme rainfall types. The flood inundation
under the Probable Maximum Precipitation presents the highest risk in
terms of water depth and inundation area. These results provide insights
into managing flood risk, designing flood prevention measures, and
appropriately locating pump stations.

Y1  - 2003///
PD  - 
AB  - The direct impacts of floods are often considered as limited to the
maximum downstream area exposed to the flooding. Considering the size of
exceptional floods, the river bed could undergo deep changes. Pairing
the GSTARS sediment transport model to a slope stability model (modified
Bishop method) that we developed, this paper presents a methodology
leading to the definition of a true safety zone along the shores as it
takes into account the risk of floods and soil movements: each section
of this river undergoes changes due to sediment-fluvial hydraulics
(erosion-deposit) and then eventual landslides modify the profiles. To
analyze this, we had first to determine the hydraulic and geotechnical
characteristics then use them to test the slope stability of the various
legs of the watercourse before and during flooding. The application of
this method to a tributary of the Saguenay River for the 1996
``downpour{''} shows a very good correlation of results with those
collected in situ. The method can be directly applied to define the
anticipated evacuation zone in case of dam failure.

PD  - 
AB  - Flash flooding is the rapid flooding of low lying areas caused by the
stormwater of intense rainfall associated with thunderstorms. Flash
flooding occurs in many urban areas with relatively flat terrain and can
result in severe property damage as well as the loss of lives. In this
paper, an integrated one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D)
hydraulic simulation model has been established to simulate stormwater
flooding processes in urban areas. With rainfall input, the model
simulates 2-D overland flow and 1-D flow in underground stormwater pipes
and drainage channels. Drainage channels are treated as special flow
paths and arranged along one or more sides of a 2-D computational grid.
By using irregular computation grids, the model simulates unsteady
flooding and drying processes over urban areas with complex drainage
systems. The model results can provide spatial flood risk information
(e.g., water depth, inundation time and flow velocity during flooding).
The model was applied to the City of Beaumont, Texas, and validated with
the recorded rainfall and runoff data from Tropical Storm Allison with
good agreement.

PD  - 
AB  - In this study, we developed an integrated method for classifying
micro-landforms and flood hazard zones based on a geomorphological
approach utilizing Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and LANDSAT
ETM + (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) data combined with field
investigation. Micro-landform units on an alluvial plain were classified
in relation to flood conditions by integrating an SRTM digital elevation
model (DEM) with spectral characteristics from a pair of LANDSAT images
from dry and flood seasons. In addition, the LANDSAT ETM + band4-band3
of the flood season image was calculated to identify moist surfaces.
Next, a flood hazard zonation map was generated by categorizing
geomorphological features and the average elevation of each landform
into flood hazard classes. Then, three-dimensional (3D) diagrams of the
composed maps were produced using GRASS 6.3 to visualize the
geomorphology and flooding risk. The results were validated using field
surveys, topographic maps and past inundation images. This case study
was undertaken for the Thu Bon alluvial plain, central Vietnam. The
findings of this study revealed a close interaction between the
geomorphological characteristics of this region and flood conditions.
Flooding and sedimentation mechanisms cause dynamic formations of
fluvial and coastal landforms, and these geomorphological features in
turn affect flood hazard. Furthermore, 43.34% of the area of this plain
is classified as having a very high or high flood hazard in lowland
areas and a flash flood hazard in higher areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The 2010-2011 Queensland floods resulted in the most deaths
from a single flood event in Australia since 1916. This article analyses
the information on these deaths for comparison with those from previous
floods in modern Australia in an attempt to identify factors that have
contributed to those deaths. Haddon's Matrix, originally designed for
prevention of road trauma, offers a framework for understanding the
interplay between contributing factors and helps facilitate a clearer
understanding of the varied strategies required to ensure people's
safety for particular flood types.
Methods: Public reports and flood relevant literature were searched
using key words `flood', `fatality', `mortality', `death', `injury' and
`victim' through Google Scholar, PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO. Data
relating to reported deaths during the 2010-2011 Queensland floods, and
relevant data of previous Australian flood fatality (1997-2009) were
collected from these available sources. These sources were also used to
identify contributing factors.
Results: There were 33 deaths directly attributed to the event, of which
54.5% were swept away in a flash flood on 10 January 2011. A further
15.1% of fatalities were caused by inappropriate behaviours. This is
different to floods in modern Australia where over 90% of deaths are
related to the choices made by individuals. There is no single reason
why people drown in floods, but rather a complex interplay of factors.
Conclusions: The present study and its integration of research findings
and conceptual frameworks might assist governments and communities to
develop policies and strategies to prevent flood injury and fatalities.

AB  - Climate change due to global warming is a public concern in Central
Asia. Because of specific orography and climate conditions, the republic
of Tajikistan is considered as the main glacial center of Central Asia.
In this study, regional climate change impacts in the two large basins
of Tajikistan, Pyanj and Vaksh River basins located in the upstream
sector of the Amu Darya River basin are analysed. A statistical
regression method with model output statistics corrections using the
ground observation data, Willmott archived dataset and GSMaP satellite
driven dataset, was developed and applied to the basins to downscale the
Global Climate Model Projections at a 0.1-degree grid and to assess the
regional climate change impacts at subbasin scale. It was found that
snow and glacier melting are of fundamental importance for the state of
the future water resources and flooding at the target basins since the
air temperature had a clearly increasing trend toward the future. It was
also found that the snowfall will decrease, but the rainfall will
increase because of the gradual increase in the air temperature. Such
changes may result in an increase in flash floods during the winter and
the early spring, and in significant changes in the hydrological regime
during a year in the future. Furthermore, the risks of floods in the
target basins may be slightly increasing because of the increase in the
frequencies and magnitudes of high daily precipitation and the increase
in the rapid snowmelt with high air temperatures toward the future.

AB  - Dam-break floods have been of increasing concern to safety engineers and
decision makers. The presence of complex terrain in inundation areas
multiplies the simulation difficulty of flood routing. In previous
studies, representing the flood routing parameters empirically does not
reflect the characteristics of flood routing, which strongly influences
the accurate assessment of the dam-break consequences. The basis for
carrying out dangerous reservoir reinforcement is just engineering
safety, without considering the actual situation of downstream areas. In
this study, a comprehensive risk analysis of the dam-break flood was
implemented based on the numerical simulation of flood routing. First,
coupled with the volume of fluid method, a three-dimensional k-E >
turbulence mathematical model was developed for flood routing in complex
inundation areas. Then, based on the flow parameters obtained through
computational fluid dynamics modeling, the attribute measure methodology
was used for the evaluation of consequences combined with the
calculation of the dam-break consequences (loss of life, economic loss,
social and environmental influence). Furthermore, a methodology
containing the combined weight method and the technique for order
performance by similarity to ideal solution method was proposed for risk
ranking of dangerous reservoirs due to its logical consideration of
scalar values that simultaneously account for both the best and worst
alternatives. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to provide
information about the stability of risk ranking. The aforementioned
model and methodology are applied to a case involving five reservoirs in
the Haihe River Basin in China for Part II of this study.

PD  - 
AB  - This study proposes a risk assessment framework for quantifying the
reliability of the rainfall threshold used in flash flood warning, which
should be influenced by the uncertainties in the rainfall
characteristics, including rainfall duration, depth, and storm pattern.
This risk assessment framework incorporates the correlated multivariate
Monte Carlo simulation method, the Sobek 1D-2D hydrodynamic model, and a
logistic regression equation to establish a quantile relationship of the
rainfall threshold for quantifying reliability of the rainfall
threshold. The Shuhu Creek catchment locates in East Taiwan, and its
historical hourly rainfall records on eight typhoon events are used as
the study area and data. The results from the proposed framework
indicate that the variation in the rainfall threshold declines with the
duration; 12-h duration associated with a stable coefficient of variance
of the rainfall threshold appears to be appropriate for the flash flood
warning in the Shuhu Creek catchment. Moreover, the issued rainfall
thresholds in the Shuhu Creek catchment by Water Resources Agency in
Taiwan have a low exceedance probability. This infers that inundation
might occur as the observed rainfall depth approaches the threshold, so
that it is necessary to lower the rainfall threshold in accordance with
higher exceedance probability in order to achieve the goal of early
flood warning.

AB  - In this study, geographic information system (GIS)-based hydrologic and
hydraulic modeling was used to perform a flood risk assessment for
Onaville, which is a fairly new, rapidly growing informal settlement
that is exposed to dangerous flash-flood events. Since records of
historic floods did not exist for the study area, design storms with a
variety of significant average return intervals (ARIs) were derived from
intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves and transformed into design
floods via rainfall-runoff modeling in hydrologic engineering center's
hydrologic modeling system (HEC-HMS). The hydraulic modeling software
hydrologic engineering center's river analysis system (HEC-RAS) was used
to perform one-dimensional, unsteady-flow simulations of the design
floods in the Ravine Lan Couline, which is the major drainage channel of
the area. Topographic data comprised a 12 m spatial resolution TanDEM-X
digital elevation model (DEM) and a 30 cm spatial resolution DEM created
with mapping drones. The flow simulations revealed that large areas of
the settlement are currently exposed to flood hazard. The results of the
hydrologic and hydraulic modeling were incorporated into a flood hazard
map which formed the basis for flood risk management. We present a
grassroots approach for preventive flood risk management on a community
level, which comprises the elaboration of a neighborhood contingency
plan and a flood risk awareness campaign together with representatives
of the local community of Onaville.

AB  - The national parks of the Canary Islands have specific environmental
features that attract thousands of tourists every year. Most of the
parks are located in mountainous areas, where hydrogeomorphic processes
and their related hazards are frequent. The main aim of this study is to
improve our understanding of the effects and frequency of these
processes in an ungauged river basin located on the island of La Palma.
In this river basin, the use of hydrological and hydraulic modelling
based on classic data sources and flood risk analysis methods has
important shortcomings because of a lack of or incomplete information.
Here, we use palaeohydrological data from tree-ring analyses of
disturbed trees as these appear to be the only reliable alternative. In
addition, dendrogeomorphological data are compared with available
meteorological and documental information to develop a multidisciplinary
flash flood record. This is the first time that Pinus canariensis has
been used in a dendrogeomorphological study we assess its suitability
for the reconstruction of flash flood events. Such techniques have not
been applied before in subtropical, tropical or equatorial areas.
Tree-ring dating data were mostly obtained from 63 wounds from 54 trees
from which two main types of post-damage tree response were identified:
growth release and growth suppression. Injuries occurring in 1962 were
especially relevant (affecting almost all the older trees) and also in
1997, with both presenting a large number of replications. Other
injuries occurred in 1993, 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2009, obtaining a record
from the dendrogeomorphological evidence. The data were compared with
daily meteorological data and available documental sources in order to
establish the most complete flash flood record possible. Our findings
provide new insight into past flood events, their frequency-magnitude
relationships, and climatic triggers, that can provide park managers
with tools to reduce natural risks and their effects on visitors and
infrastructure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

11.2% on average, using continuous hourly gauge records for 1971-2013
from 721 weather stations in China. The corresponding event accumulated
precipitation has on average increased by more than 10% aided by a
small positive trend in events duration. Linear regression of the 95th
percentile daily precipitation intensity with daily mean surface air
temperature shows a negative scaling of -9.6%/K, in contrast to a
positive scaling of 10.6%/K for hourly data. This is made up of a
positive scaling below the summer mean temperature and a negative
scaling above. Using seasonal means instead of daily means, we find a
consistent scaling rate for the region of 6.7-7%/K for both daily and
hourly precipitation extremes, about 10% higher than the regional
Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of 6.1%/K based on a mean temperature of
24.6 degrees C. With up to 18% further increase in extreme
precipitation under continuing global warming towards the IPCC's 1.5
degrees C target, risks of flash floods will exacerbate on top of the
current incapability of urban drainage systems in a rapidly urbanizing
China.

AB  - Floods are a major threat in many valleys of the Indian Himalayan Region
(IHR). Yet, the lack of reliable data on past events renders the
implementation of appropriate adaptation policies a difficult task, and
therefore also hampers the mitigation of future disasters. In an attempt
to overcome these shortcomings, we combine reconstructed paleoflood
events based on tree-ring analyses with existing systematic records, so
as to derive a regional flood frequency. Analysis was realized with
tree-ring records and through the dating of growth disturbances in
riparian trees of major rivers in Kullu district (Himachal Pradesh,
Indian Himalayas). To this end, we combined field-based observations,
tree-ring analyses, hydraulic modelling and statistical approaches.
Results suggest that the occurrence of floods in Kullu district is
recurrent, with a marked seasonality and a cyclic natural variability in
flood frequency at multidecadal scales, as well as distinct spatial
representativeness. The inclusion of peak discharge data of past,
previously ungauged, flood events derived from tree-ring records has a
significant and positive impact on the flood frequency assessment. Flood
hazards and associated risks have been clearly underestimated in the
region and based on the systematic records alone. We also demonstrate
that a regional flood frequency approach is suitable to optimize the
information gathered from tree rings and that flood frequency can thus
be analyzed for larger regions. The approach used in this paper can be
implemented in the other, poorly gauged region and thus contribute to
climate change adaptation policies in undocumented environments such as
the Indian Himalayan Region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Projections of future climate change (1970-1999 compared to 2030-2059)
for southwest Western Australia (SWWA) are analysed for a regional
climate model (RCM) ensemble using the Weather Research and Forecasting
Model with boundary conditions from three CMIP3 general circulation
models (GCMs); CCSM3, CSIROmk3.5 and ECHAM5. We show that the RCM adds
value to the GCM and we suggest that this is through improved
representation of regional scale topography and enhanced land-atmosphere
interactions. Our results show that the mean daytime temperature
increase is larger than the nighttime increase, attributed to reduced
soil moisture and hence increased surface sensible heat flux in the
model, and there is statistically significant evidence that the variance
of minimum temperatures will increase. Changes in summer rainfall are
uncertain, with some models showing rainfall increases and others
projecting reductions. All models show very large fluctuations in summer
rainfall intensity which has important implications because of the
increased risk of flash flooding and erosion of arable land. There is
model consensus indicating a decline in winter rainfall and the spatial
distribution of this rainfall decline is influenced by regional scale
topography in two of the three simulations. Winter rainfall reduction is
consistent with the historical trend of declining rainfall in SWWA,
which has been attributed in previous research to a reduction in the
number of fronts passing over the region. The continuation of this trend
is evident in all models by an increase in winter mean sea level
pressure in SWWA, and a reduced number of winter front days. Winter
rainfall does not show any marked variations in daily intensity.

AB  - A reliable estimation of soil moisture conditions is fundamental for
rivers' discharge predictions, especially in small catchments where
flash floods occur. In this context, microwave remote sensing can be
exploited to estimate soil moisture at large scale. These estimates can
be used to enhance the predictions of hydrological models using data
assimilation techniques. Flash flood early warning systems can, thus, be
improved. This study tested the effect of the assimilation of three
different ASCAT-derived soil moisture products, processed and
distributed within the EUMETSAT H-SAF framework (SM-OBS-1, SM-OBS-2,
SM-DAS-2), into a distributed physically based hydrological model
(Continuum). The study areas were three Italian catchments,
representative of the typical Mediterranean small basins prone to flash
floods. The products were first preprocessed in order to be comparable
with the model soil moisture state estimate. Subsequently, they were
assimilated using three Nudging-based techniques. Then, observed
discharges were compared with the modeled one in order to understand the
impact of the assimilation. The analysis was executed for a multiyear
period ranging from July 2012 to June 2014 in order to test the
assimilation algorithms for operational purposes in real-cases
scenarios. Findings showed that the assimilation of H-SAF soil moisture
products with simple preprocessing and assimilation techniques can
enhance discharge predictions; the improvements significantly affect
high flows. Although SM-OBS-2 and SM-DAS-1 are added-value products with
respect to SM-OBS-1 (respectively, higher spatial and temporal
resolution), they may not necessarily perform better. The impact of the
assimilation strongly relies on the permanent catchment characteristics
(e.g., topography, hydrography, land cover).

PD  - 
AB  - Korea repeatedly experiences flash floods and droughts that cause
traumatic environmental conditions with huge economic impact. Recently
due to climate change, the frequency and magnitude of natural disasters
associated with extreme hydrologic events increased rapidly in Korea.
Floods caused the greatest damage among all natural disasters. To
prevent this damage it is important to inform people about ongoing and
upcoming flash flood events to avoid the loss of life and property. In
this study hardware and software based smart technology is used to
develop an early flood warning system for Mushim stream watershed to
send to end users early flood warning messages about potentially
impacted areas. Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling
System (HEC-HMS) is the core of flood alert application provides the
forecast with sufficient lead time and decides the threshold conditions
of runoff/stage. Short range weather forecasts from Korea Meteorological
Administration (KMA) at every three hours interval, are stored in
hydro-meteorological database and fed in HEC-HMS for identification of
flood risks. Server-Client based program used to visualize the real time
flood condition and to deliver the early warning message. The findings
of this study are expected to be used as basic data required for
designing of flood mitigation measures at Mushim stream watershed to
cope with the flash flood events in future. The flood hazard maps thus
developed will be useful to policy-makers and responsible authorities,
as well as to local residents in finding suitable measures for reducing
flood risk in the study area.

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - The present work introduces a national scale flood hazard assessment
methodology, using multi-criteria analysis and artificial neural
networks (ANNs) techniques in a GIS environment. The proposed
methodology was applied in Greece, where flash floods are a relatively
frequent phenomenon and it has become more intense over the last
decades, causing significant damages in rural and urban sectors. In
order the most prone flooding areas to be identified, seven factor-maps
(that are directly related to flood generation) were combined in a GIS
environment. These factor-maps are: a) the Flow accumulation (F), b) the
Land use (L), c) the Altitude (A), b) the Slope (S), e) the soil
Erodibility (E), f) the Rainfall intensity (R), and g) the available
water Capacity (C). The name to the proposed method is ``FLASERC{''}.
The flood hazard for each one of these factors is classified into five
categories: Very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The above
factors are combined and processed using the appropriate ANN algorithm
tool. For the ANN training process spatial distribution of historical
flooded points in Greece within the five different flood hazard
categories of the aforementioned seven factor-maps were combined. In
this way, the overall flood hazard map for Greece was determined. The
final results are verified using additional historical flood events that
have occurred in Greece over the last 100 years. In addition, an
overview of flood protection measures and adaptation policy approaches
were proposed for agricultural and urban areas located at very high
flood hazard areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - Alluvial fans are often present at the outlet of small drainage basins
in alpine valleys; their formation is due to sediment transport
associated with flash floods and debris flows. Alluvial fans are
preferred sites for human settlements and are frequently crossed by
transport routes. In order to reduce the risk for economic activities
located on or near the fan and prevent loss of lives due to floods and
debris flows, torrent control works have been extensively carried out on
many alpine alluvial fans. Hazard management on alluvial fans in alpine
regions is dependent upon reliable procedures to evaluate variations in
the frequency and severity of hydrogeomorphic processes and the
long-term performance of the torrent training works. An integrated
approach to the analysis of hydrogeomorphic processes and their
interactions with torrent control works has been applied to a large
alluvial fan in the southern Carnic Alps (northeastern Italy). Study
methods encompass field observations, interpretation of aerial
photographs, analysis of historical documents, and numerical modelling
of debris flows. The overall performance of control works implemented in
the early decades of 20th century was satisfactory, and a reduction of
hazardous events was recognised from features observed in the field and
in aerial photographs, as well as from the analysis of historical
records. The 2-D simulation of debris flows confirms these findings,
indicating that debris flow deposition would not affect urban areas or
main roads, even in the case of a high-magnitude event. Present issues
in the management of the studied alluvial fan are representative of
situations frequently found in the European Alps and deal with the need
for maintenance of the control structures and the pressures for land use
changes aimed at the economic exploitation of the fan surface.

T1  - Use of radar rainfall estimates and forecasts to prevent flash flood in real time by using a road inundation warning system
A1  - Versini, Pierre-Antoine
Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - Important damages occur in small headwater catchments when they are hit
by severe storms with complex spatio-temporal structure, sometimes
resulting in flash floods. As these catchments are mostly not covered by
sensor networks, it is difficult to forecast these floods. This is
particularly true for road submersions, representing major concerns for
flood event managers. The use of Quantitative Precipitation Estimates
and Forecasts (QPE/QPF) especially based on radar measurements could
particularly be adequate to evaluate rainfall-induced risks. Although
their characteristic time and space scales would make them suitable for
flash flood modelling, the impact of their uncertainties remain
uncertain and have to be evaluated.
The Gard region (France) has been chosen as case study. This area is
frequently affected by severe flash floods, and an application devoted
to the road network has also been recently developed for the North part
of this region. This warning system combines distributed
hydro-meteorological modelling and susceptibility analysis to provide
warnings of road inundations. The warning system has been tested on the
specific storm of the 29-30 September 2007. During this event, around
200 mm dropped on the South part of the Gard and many roads were
submerged. Radar-based QPE and QPF have been used to forecast the exact
location of road submersions and the results have been compared to the
effective road submersions actually occurred during the event as listed
by the emergency services.
Used on an area it has not been calibrated, the results confirm that the
road submersion warning system represents a promising tool for
anticipating and quantifying the consequences of storm events at ground.
It rates the submersion risk with an acceptable level of accuracy and
demonstrates also the quality of high spatial and temporal resolution
radar rainfall data in real time, and the possibility to use them
despite their uncertainties. However because of the quality of rainfall
forecasts falls drastically with time, it is not often sufficient to
provide valuable information for lead times exceeding 1 h. (C) 2011

PD  - 
AB  - Particular attention is given to the reliability of hydrological
modelling results. The accuracy of river runoff projection depends on
the selected set of hydrological model parameters, emission scenario and
global climate model. The aim of this article is to estimate the
uncertainty of hydrological model parameters, to perform sensitivity
analysis of the runoff projections, as well as the contribution analysis
of uncertainty sources (model parameters, emission scenarios and global
climate models) in forecasting Lithuanian river runoff. The impact of
model parameters on the runoff modelling results was estimated using a
sensitivity analysis for the selected hydrological periods (spring
flood, winter and autumn flash floods, and low water). During spring
flood the results of runoff modelling depended on the calibration
parameters that describe snowmelt and soil moisture storage, while
during the low water period-the parameter that determines river
underground feeding was the most important. The estimation of climate
change impact on hydrological processes in the Merkys and Neris river
basins was accomplished through the combination of results from A1B, A2
and B1 emission scenarios and global climate models (ECHAM5 and HadCM3).
The runoff projections of the thirty-year periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070,
2071-2100) were conducted applying the HBV software. The uncertainties
introduced by hydrological model parameters, emission scenarios and
global climate models were presented according to the magnitude of the
expected changes in Lithuanian rivers runoff. The emission scenarios had
much greater influence on the runoff projection than the global climate
models. The hydrological model parameters had less impact on the
reliability of the modelling results.

AB  - Over the last forty years, applying dendrogeomorphology to palaeoflood
analysis has improved estimates of the frequency and magnitude of past
floods worldwide. This paper reviews the main results obtained by
applying dendrogeomorphology to flood research in several case studies
in Central Spain. These dendrogeomorphological studies focused on the
following topics: (1) anatomical analysis to understand the
physiological response of trees to flood damage and improve sampling
efficiency; (2) compiling robust flood chronologies in ungauged mountain
streams, (3) determining flow depth and estimating flood discharge using
two-dimensional hydraulic modelling, and comparing them with other
palaeostage indicators; (4) calibrating hydraulic model parameters (i.e.
Manning roughness); and (5) implementing stochastic-based, cost-benefit
analysis to select optimal mitigation measures. The progress made in
these areas is presented with suggestions for further research to
improve the applicability of dendrogeochronology to palaeoflood studies.
Further developments will include new methods for better identification
of the causes of specific types of flood damage to trees (e.g. tilted
trees) or stable isotope analysis of tree rings to identify the climatic
conditions associated with periods of increasing flood magnitude or
frequency. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

is described. The system uses rainfall intensity data from terrestrial
microwave communication links and the geostationary Meteosat Second
Generation satellite, i.e., two systems that are already in place and
operational. Flash flood early warnings are based on a combination of
the Flash Flood Guidance method and a hydrological model. The system
will be maintained and operated through a public-private partnership,
which includes a mobile telephone operator, a national meteorological
service and an emergency relief service. The mobile telephone operator
acts as both the supplier of raw input data and the disseminator of
early warnings. The early warning system could significantly reduce the
number of fatalities due to flash floods, improve the efficiency of
disaster risk reduction efforts and play an important role in
strengthening the resilience to climate change of developing countries
in Africa. This paper describes the system that is currently being
developed for Kenya.

AB  - A multidisciplinary methodology for historical floods reconstruction was
applied to 1874 Santa Tecla floods occurred in Catalonia (NE Iberian
Peninsula), using both historical information and meteorological data
from 20th Century Reanalysis.
The results confirmed the exceptionality of the event: the highest
modeled specific peak flow was around 14.6 m(3) s(-1) km(-2) in a 100
km(2) catchment and all the modeled total rainfall values were above 110
mm in about six hours, with maximum intensities around 60 mm min(-1).
The peak-flows peak flows' return periods were about 260 years and the
rainfalls periods were between 250 and 500 years. The meteorological
cause of the rainstorms was the flash triggering effect, initiated by
the withdrawal of a mass of hot air at mid-levels.
A sensitivity analysis on the various sources of error shows that peak
flow errors from hydraulic modeling ranged from 5% to 44%, and
rainfall errors from hydrological modeling were about 36%. (C) 2015

of 1865-2010 are gathered in the DISASTER database. This database
contains 1,902 hydro-geomorphologic cases that caused 1,248 fatalities
(81% and 19% associated with floods and landslides, respectively). The
use of the DISASTER database allowed for: (i) the analysis of the
frequency and the temporal evolution of fatal floods and landslides;
(ii) the analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of fatalities;
(iii) the identification of the most deadly flood and landside types;
(iv) the verification of gender tendencies in mortalities; and (v) the
evaluation of individual and societal risk. The highest number of flood
and landslide cases and related mortalities occurred in the period of
1935-1969. After this period, the number of flood and landslide
mortalities decreased, although landslide fatalities remained higher
than those registered in the period of 1865-1934. The occurrence of
flood fatalities was widespread in the country, with an important
cluster in the Lisbon region and in the Tagus valley, while fatalities
caused by landslides mainly occurred in the north of the Tagus valley.
Flash floods caused the majority of fatalities associated with floods,
while falls and flows were responsible for the highest number of
fatalities associated with landslides. Males were found to have the
highest frequency of fatalities. In the case of floods, the majority of
fatalities were found both outdoors and inside of buildings in rural
areas while fatalities inside buildings were dominant in landslide
cases, mostly in rural areas.

PD  - 
AB  - Long-term field studies in semiarid ephemeral streams are rare. These
geomorphic data are essential for understanding the nature of the
processes in order to develop modelling for risk assessments and
management. An extreme flood event on 28 September 2012 affected the
Murcia region of SE Spain, including long-tem monitoring sites on two
fluvial systems in the Guadalentin basin, the Nogalte and Torrealvilla.
Detailed morphological data were collected before and immediately after
the event; and the amount of morphological change, erosion, and
deposition have been related to peak flow conditions at the sites.
On the Nogalte channel, peak flow reached 2500 m(3) s(-1) at the
downstream end of the catchment in less than 1 h. The event had a
recurrence interval of >50 years based on rainfall records and damage to
old irrigation structures. The major effect in the braided, gravel
channel of the Nogalte was net aggradation, with massive deposition in
large flat bars. The measured changes in bankfull capacity were highly
correlated with most hydraulic variables. Net changes in cut-and-fill in
cross sections on the Nogalte were highly related to peak discharge and
stream power but much less so to measures of hydraulic force (velocity,
shear stress, unit stream power). Relationships of amount of erosion to
hydraulic variables were much weaker than for amount of deposition,
which was largely scaled to channel size and flow energy. Changes on the
Torrealvilla were much less than on the Nogalte, and net erosion
occurred at all sites. Sites on the Nogalte channel in schist exhibited
higher deposition than those of the Torrealvilla sites on marl for the
same hydraulic values.
Overall, less morphological change took place in the extreme event on
the Nogalte than predicted from some published hydraulic relations,
probably reflecting the high sediment supply and the hydrological
characteristics of the event. The results demonstrate the high degree of
adjustment of these channels to the occasional, high magnitude, flash
flood events and that such events need to be allowed for in management.
The detailed quantitative evidence produced by these long-term
monitoring sites provide valuable, rare data for modelling morphological
response to flood events in ephemeral channels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Lesser Zab River, in the northeast of Iraq and northwest of Iran, is
the largest tributary inside Iraq supplying water to the Tigris River.
The majority of the basin lies inside Iraq. The important goals of this
study are to estimate the erodibility and flash flood hazard of the
Lesser Zab River Basin (LZRB). The present research highlights
sub-basins that should be prioritized for conservation and flood risk
schemes. The morphometric analysis reveals that the most important
sub-basins are Sb1 and Sb2, in terms of water contribution to the main
river. They are characterized by higher stream order, larger area, high
elevation, low drainage density, low drainage texture, and low relative
relief. Because of the relatively high relief in the upper part of the
LZRB, the sub-basins are characterized by low drainage density, which
indicates more surface runoff compared to the main basin in the lower
part. The very fine drainage texture in the upper part of the LZRB
reflects low infiltration and higher runoff relative to the lower part.
The sub-basins in the upper part of the LZRB, which have a low
bifurcation ratio, produce flood hydrographs with marked discharge
peaks, while the subbasins in the lower part, which have high ratios,
produce low peaks over a long time period. Various morphometric
parameters have been used for each sub-basin to calculate compound
parameters for the final ranking of the subbasins. Based on utilization
of morphometric parameters for the erodibility hazard assessment,
sub-basins were divided into seven prioritization classes: critical,
very high to critical, high to very high, medium to high, low to medium,
very low to low, and lowest. Furthermore, the resultant hazard map
indicates that 18 sub-basins have moderate to low risk of flash flooding
and 29 sub-basins have low possibility of flash flooding.

AB  - Nuweiba sits on a flood plain between the Sinai Mountain and the Gulf of
Aqaba. Flash floods pose significant threats to socio-economic
development in the region. This study assessed flash floods risk in the
greater Nuweiba area in support of mitigation planning. Our approach
evaluated topographic, hydrological, and geological factors holistically
to rank areas of high, median, and low flash floods risk along the Wadi
Watir. Data from field surveys, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery,
and Shuttle Radar Terrain Model (SRTM) were analyzed through digital
image processing and spatial analysis to characterize lithology, soil
types, land cover, and hydrological morphometrics. The morphometric
parameters were used to evaluate the most sensitive sub-basins for
flooding and create the flash flood susceptibility map. Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) Rainfall-Runoff model was used to estimate
hydrological responses at ungauged catchments, including runoff depth,
lag time, and peak discharge. We spatially integrated all the risk
factors and created a flash floods risk map as the practical geospatial
assessment of flash flood risk in the greater Nuweiba area. (C) 2016

PD  - 
AB  - Thunderstorms and their ground effects, such as flash floods, hail,
lightning, strong winds, and tornadoes, are responsible for most weather
damages in northern Italy, especially in the warm season from May to
September. A nowcasting and warning system focused on severe
thunderstorm events would be useful to reduce risks for people involved
in outside activities and for electric, telecommunication, and sensitive
industrial business. C-band radar and Lighting Location Systems provide
useful, fast and high resolution data for the detection of convective
systems and for following their dynamics. The whole of northern Italy is
covered by radar with a resolution of 1 km and by a lightning network
with a mean accuracy of 0.5 km on the single point of impact. The
authors present an algorithm developed for tracking high intensity storm
cells by means of radar and lightning data. Application to northern
Italy reveals that tracking thunderstorm cells can be used as an alert
system that may help prevent damages from extreme weather, as well as
allowing for studying the correlation among lightning, rainfall and
tornado occurrence. Assessing the algorithm skill is also discussed, and
a forecast verification method is described and applied for the duration
of a thunderstorm season.

T1  - Interaction between a dam site and karst springs: The case of Supramonte (Central-East Sardinia, Italy)
A1  - de Waele, Jo
Y1  - 2008///
PD  - 
AB  - Sardinia is one of the Italian regions with the greatest number of dams
per inhabitants, almost 60 for a population of only 1.5 million people.
Many of these dam sites are located on non-carbonate rocks along the
main rivers of the Island and their waters are used for irrigation,
industrial, energy supply, drinking and flood regulation purposes.
The Pedra a Othoni dam on the Cedrino river (Dorgali, Central-East
Sardinia) is located along the threshold of the Palaeozoic basement on
the Northern border of the Supramonte karst area, where water is forced
to flow out of the system through several resurgences, the most famous
of which is the Su Gologone vauclusian spring, used for drinking water
supply. The other main outflows of the system, Sri Tippari and San
Pantaleo springs, are at present almost permanently submerged by the
high water level of the Pedra `e Othoni dam. In the near future water
will be supplied also to other communities with a possible increase of
water taken from the spring.
The dam, originally meant to regulate the flooding of Cedrino river but
actually used for all sorts of purposes (electricity supply, drinking
water, irrigation of farmlands, industrial uses), has a maximum
regulation altitude of 103 m a.s.l., only slightly less than a meter
below the Su Gologone spring level (103.7 m), and 4 and 9 m respectively
above the submerged Su Tippari and San Pantaleo springs.
During floods of the Cedrino river, occurring on average twice a year,
also the Su Gologone spring becomes submerged by the muddy waters of the
lake for a time ranging between a couple of hours up to several days,
making water supply impossible.
The analysis of the available meteorological and hydrogeological data
relative to the December 2004 flood, one of the severest of the past 100
years, suggests that the reservoir is filled in a few days time. Several
flooding scenarios have been reconstructed using digital terrain models,
showing that backflooding submerges most of the discharge area of the
aquifer, having important repercussions also on the inland underground
drainage system. The upstream flood prone areas prevalently comprise
agricultural lands with some sparse houses, but also highly frequented
tourist facilities. Fortunately flooding occurs outside the tourist
season, thus limiting risk to a limited number of local inhabitants.
Massive discharge at the dam site, instead, determines a more hazardous
situation in the Cedrino coastal plain, where population density in low
lying areas is much higher. To avoid flooding hazard upstream the water
level in the lake should be regulated, keeping it low in the flood prone
seasons, and having it filled from the end of the winter in order to
have enough water stocked before the beginning of the summer. Discharge
at the dam site, instead, should be done cautiously, preventing severe
flooding of the coastal Cedrino plain. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

PD  - 
AB  - Introduction: In mid-July 2010 flash flooding in Pakistan destroyed the
basic water, environmental sanitation and livelihood infrastructures in
82 districts. Two months later, the local press of Swat (northern
Pakistan) reported that several residents of Marghazar town became ill
and were hospitalized after drinking contaminated water. A
non-governmental organization (Oxfam GB) team took action to determine
the causes of this incident and analyzed the community drinking water
supply.
Methods: Standard methods were used to analyze six physio-chemical and
four microbiological water quality parameters at five selected sampling
locations in the water supply system.
Results: The samples from sites numbers (SN) 02, 03, 04 and 05 were
found to be microbiologically unfit for drinking due to the presence of
Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus (range
18-96 +/- 14 cfu/100 mL). However, the pH, conductivity, total dissolved
solid, total hardness as calcium carbonate and nitrate as NO3-2 of all
the samples were within WHO permissible limits. Higher turbidities were
recorded at SN04 and 05 of 6 +/- 0.23 and 9 +/- 1.23, respectively.
Conclusion: Quantitative results revealed the presence of pathogenic
organisms and water quality risk factors due to the damaged water and
environmental sanitation infrastructure. Continued water quality
monitoring, the application of household based disinfectants, and
healthy domestic hygiene practices are highly recommended in similar
circumstances.

AB  - This work provides an analysis of the Weisseritz 2002 flood event in
Eastern Germany, which was characterized by intense upslope storm
movement and associated orographic enhancement of precipitation.
Examination of the event is based on the availability of weather radar
observations and post-event surveys to document the peak runoff rates.
The analysis is based on the use of a set of statistics that clarify the
dependence existing between spatial rainfall distribution, basin
morphology, and runoff response. The statistics provide a description of
overall spatial rainfall organization at the catchment scale in terms of
concentration and dispersion statistics and storm motion, as a function
of the flow distance coordinates, i.e., distance to the outlet measured
along the flow path. The statistics are based on the observation that
runoff routing through branched channel networks imposes an effective
averaging of spatial rainfall at equal flow distance, despite the
inherent spatial variability. A spatially distributed rainfall-runoff
model is used to evaluate the effects of the rainfall spatial
variability and storm velocity on flood modeling at various river
sections. It is shown that storm velocity exhibits rather moderate
values, despite the strong kinematic characteristics of individual storm
elements. Consistently with this observation, hydrologic simulations
show that oro-graphically controlled rainfall spatial variability and
storm motion have an almost negligible effect on flood response
modeling. The drainage network structure filters out the effects of
spatial rainfall variability for storm event hydrologic response,
resulting in Weisseritz exhibiting striking uniformity of response to a
storm with strongly varying precipitation. Overall, this shows the value
of using the rainfall statistics introduced in this paper to isolate and
describe the features of rainfall space-time variability that have
significant impacts on runoff simulation. DOI:

A1  - Ortega, J A

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - Ephemeral streams induce flash-flood events, which cause dramatic
morphological changes and impacts on population, mainly because they are
intermittent and less predictable. Human pressures on the basin modify
load and discharge relationships, inducing dormant instability on the
fluvial system that will manifest abruptly during flood events. The
flash-flood response of two ephemeral streams affected by load supply
modification due to land use changes is discussed in a combination of
geomorphic and hydraulic approaches. During the Rivillas flash flood,
intensive clearing on the basin led to high rates of sediment flowing
into an artificially straightened and inefficient channel. The stream
evolved from a sinuous single channel into a shallow braiding occupying
the entire width of the valley floor. Misfits and unsteady channel
conditions increased velocity, stream power and sediment entrainment
capacity and considerably magnified flood damage. Resulting
morphosedimentary features revealed a close relationship with the valley
floor post-flood hydraulic model, and pre-event awareness would have
made it possible to predict risk-sensitive areas. In the second case,
the Azoh a stream, modelling of current pre-flood channel conditions
make it possible to determine channel narrowing and entrenchment in the
lower alluvial fan stretch. Abandonment of intensive agriculture, basin
reforestation and urbanization diminish load contribution and trigger
channel incision. This induces an increase in slope and velocity in the
bankfull channel, producing renewed erosive energy and thus activating
upstream propagation of incision and bank undermining. The absence of
water-spreading dynamics on the alluvial fan in favour of confinement in
a single channel produces an unstable dynamic in the system, also
offering a false sense of stability, as long as no large magnitude
floods occur. When modelling flood-prone areas and analysing hydraulic
variables, it is important to detect possible anthropic disturbances
that may affect basin load budgets in order to anticipate catastrophic
consequences resulting from inappropriate fluvial management before the
occurrence of an extraordinary event.

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - Systems for the early detection of floods over continental and global
domains have a key role in providing a quick overview of areas at risk,
raise the awareness and prompt higher detail analyses as the events
approach. However, the reliability of these systems is prone to spatial
inhomogeneity, depending on the quality of the underlying input data and
local calibration.
This work proposes a simple approach for flood early warning based on
ensemble numerical predictions of surface runoff provided by weather
forecasting centers. The system is based on a novel indicator, referred
to as an extreme runoff index (ERI), which is calculated from the input
data through a statistical analysis. It is designed for use in large or
poorly gauged domains, as no local knowledge or in situ observations are
needed for its setup. Daily runs over 32 months are evaluated against
calibrated hydrological simulations for all of Europe. Results show
skillful flood early warning capabilities up to a 10-day lead time. A
dedicated analysis is performed to investigate the optimal timing of
forecasts to maximize the detection of extreme events. A case study for
the central European floods of June 2013 is presented and forecasts are
compared to the output of a hydro-meteorological ensemble model.

AB  - The Lockyer Valley region in southeast Queensland. Australia experienced
extreme flash flooding in January 2011 that resulted in the loss of 19
lives including 12 in the township of Grantham. In order to reduce
future risks, the Lockyer Valley Regional Council (LVRC) immediately
committed to an innovative community resettlement project, despite an
environment of political resistance and bureaucratic turmoil. From a
local government perspective, this paper provides an overview and
examination of the unique disaster recovery and resettlement process
undertaken by the LVRC. A mixed methods approach was used to assess the
resettlement project in terms of political, cultural, social and
financial factors that act to sustain and improve people's lives and
livelihoods. Methods included field observations, documentary analysis,
focus group discussions and semistructured interviews with key LVRC
officers. Integrating the interview data sets and a variety of source
materials, this paper assesses the early-stage outcomes of the
resettlement and recovery process in Grantham and discusses the
challenges and issues identified in the process so far. The paper
addresses the significance of collaboration between all sectors involved
including community members; governments; and land-use planning and
emergency management practitioners. This research highlights the
importance of community participation and the need for ongoing
assessments in the resettlement and recovery process. (C) 2014 The

PD  - 
AB  - Worldwide climate is likely to become more variable or extreme with
increases in intense precipitation. In Mediterranean areas, climate
change will increase the risks of droughts, flash floods and soil
erosion. Despite rainfall intensity being a key factor in erosive
processes, in these areas information on extreme rainfall intensity and
the associated erosivity, based on high-temporal resolution data, is
either non homogeneous or scarce. These parameters thus need to be
assessed in order to highlight suitable adaptation strategies. In this
paper, an hourly rainfall intensity (RI) data series is analyzed
together with the corresponding 1-min rainfall intensity maximum (RIm)
of 23 rainfall gauges located in Tuscany, Italy, in an area highly
vulnerable to erosion. The aim is to look for temporal trends
(1989-2010) in extreme rainfall intensity and erosivity. Fixed effect
logistic regression shows statistically significant temporal increases
in the number of RI and RIm exceedances over the 95th percentile
threshold. Winter is shown to be the season with the strongest
increasing trend in coastal and inland rainfall gauge groups, followed
by spring for the coastal group and autumn for the inland group. Linear
regressions show that in the inland group there is a temporal increase
in rainfall erosivity and on a seasonal basis, the highest increase is
observed in autumn. By contrast, for the coastal group this increasing
trend is only detectable for spring and winter. Such an increase in
rainfall erosivity and its potential continuation could have a strong
adverse effect on Mediterranean land conservation.

AB  - River flooding causes significant losses to crops and negatively affects
local agriculture economies, particularly in rural riverine areas. In
this work, a techno-economic methodology for the monetary estimation of
crop losses due to flash flooding is presented. The methodology takes
into account flood depth and flow velocity, as provided by MIKE FLOOD,
as well as the season of flood occurrence, and provides monetary
estimates of crop damage based on synthetic logistic flow velocity-flood
depth-crop damage surfaces. The development of the flood damage surfaces
involved a questionnaire survey targeting practicing and research
agronomists. Subsequently, a weighted Monte Carlo simulation was
performed in order to enhance the questionnaire-based loss estimate
information. Finally, synthetic flow velocity-flood depth-crop damage
surfaces were developed for every crop under study and for every month
using logistic regression analysis. The damage surfaces are an essential
component of the developed model which was implemented in Python,
enabling the GIS visualization of the estimated agricultural damage. The
aforementioned methodology was applied for estimating the damage caused
by a flash flood that took place in the Koiliaris River Basin in Crete
for which no historical data exist. The novelty of the proposed
methodology is the development of local synthetic flow velocity-flood
depth-crop damage surfaces. Furthermore, the velocity parameter, which
is taken into account, makes the methodology suitable for flash flood
events, where significant discharges and high velocities dominate, or
for flood event cases which are characterized by high flow velocities.
The methodology identifies rural areas and agricultural land uses that
are most prone to flooding and serious crop damages and thus require
greater attention. Furthermore, the methodology aptitude for developing
local damage surfaces could be modulated in order to confront different
flood scenarios on various crops distributions and be used to address
agricultural planning activities.

AB  - The Jeddah city is located in a coastal plain area, in the middle of the
western side of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, bounded by the Red Sea to
the west and mountains to the east. Jeddah city receives rainfall runoff
from the foothills through different drainage pathways (wadis). During
intense rainfall events, runoff flows westward from the hills and
mountains towards the Red Sea, causing flash floods in the urban areas
along the pathways of these wadis. Two major flash flood events occurred
in Jeddah city during 20 November 2009 - January 2011. These events were
characterized by rainfall precipitation values of 70 and 111 mm,
respectively. Each flash flood event has duration of three hours. The
impact of these two flood events have been disastrous causing extensive
flooding that killed 113 people in 2009 and damaged infrastructure and
property (more than 10,000 homes and 17,000 vehicles). This study deals
with the analysis of the different factors that caused these flash flood
events. The results indicate that the causes of these floods are related
to a number of factors which play as a major contribution to the
worsening of the flood disaster. These factors were classified into the
following: geomorphological features, anthropogenic activities (urban
changes), network and catchment factors, and rainfall and climatic
changes factors. The climatic changes have a major impact on the
rainfall intensity and will appear more in the future. Other factors
related to the wadis tributaries are narrow passes, and high slope of
the wadi has additional impacts in the flash floods in the area. The
anthropogenic activities include the proliferation of slums and
construction in the valleys coupled with the lack of suitable water
streams to accommodate the amount of water flowing and the presence of
dirt led to the direction of flow.

T1  - Runoff modeling of the wadi systems for estimating flash flood and groundwater recharge potential in Southern Sinai, Egypt
A1  - Masoud, Alaa A
Y1  - 2011///
PD  - 
AB  - Evaluating the likelihood of a flash flood as well as flood water
resource is vital for establishing properly sustainable developments in
arid environments. However, the high degree of spatial and temporal
variability in hydrometeorological processes and the general lack of
suitable data limit these efforts. In the present work, a runoff model,
adopting the simple Soil Conservation Service method, was built for 13
ungauged catchments in Southern Sinai, Egypt. Runoff modeling was
conducted as a function of the descriptive parameters of the catchments,
and the maximum average rainfall occurred in 1 day in the period
1960-1990, designed according to a storm event recorded at the outlet of
one of the studied catchments on the 2nd of November 1994. The
catchments' descriptive parameters were extracted from available remote
sensing data and field investigations. Land covers including road
networks and 83 rock-soil types were also extracted from the maximum
likelihood classification of the Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery. The catchments
were then subdivided into 103 smaller subcatchments, which were then
placed into different terrain types according to hydrologically relevant
surface characteristics. Hydrologic characteristics and soil type(s) in
the subcatchments were estimated during on-site visits. Morphometric
parameters of the wadi catchments and the channel networks were derived
from the analysis of the SRTM3 digital elevation model (DEM).
Hydrographs were drawn and routed to the main catchment outlets based on
appropriate wadi dimensions and roughness using the Muskingum's method.
The runoff and infiltration volumes were quantified. The resulting
models have been used to investigate the relative potential for flooding
and the groundwater recharge in the catchments. Further, in order to
determine specific sites with a high potential for flood risk and
groundwater recharge, decision-ruled integrated analysis of the
generated GIS layers describing relative stream power and wetness
indices were applied. Due to the lack of flow data, the results of the
hydrological models were validated against the DEM-derived relative
stream power and the wetness indices as well as against field checks and
available reports as an alternative. The results of this study could
help to prioritize areas where flood control measures should be
directed, as well as effectively augment management plans for the
appropriate development of water resources.

AB  - A significant number of crashes on roads are caused by adverse weather
conditions. Among the most serious consequences of rainfall and flooding
in regard to road safety are the motor vehicle-related flash flood
fatalities. These fatalities are of particular concern in Texas.
Information on motor vehicle fatalities caused by flash floods was
extracted from the National Climatic Data Center Storm Data reports.
Review of reports on flash flood fatalities in general, where the death
circumstances are provided, reveals that most fatalities are motor
vehicle-related (80%). Moreover, data from the reports indicate that
from 1959 to 2009 the number of motor vehicle-related flash flood
fatalities in Texas exceeds by far the total number of flood fatalities
in any other state. Demographic analysis of the flash flood fatalities
indicates that, in Texas, all ages are at risk and that males are much
more affected than females. Spatial analysis indicates that the highest
numbers of fatalities occur in counties having major urban areas. The
increase in the frequency and intensity of storms and floods that is
projected to result from climate changes and variability, and the rapid
urbanization in the region may considerably increase the impacts of
weather on road safety in Texas.

AB  - Current management of disaster risks is often fragmented due to a lack
of coordination between involved actors, i.e. civil protection and
spatial planning - a phenomenon which is known as the `problem of
interplay'. This paper presents an output-oriented risk management
approach ('parametric governance'). Here, the modality of the
achievement of objectives remains in the hands of the given addressees.
This implies a shift from a top-down to a more collaborative,
process-oriented form of decision-making. The approach has been
successfully applied in two hazard cases and three administrative
contexts: (a) the City of Dortmund (Germany) facing flash floods, (b)
East Attica region (Greece) facing forest fires, and (c) Lazio Region
(Italy) also facing forest fires. As proved by the applications of the
concept, a dialogue among experts, stakeholders, and decision-makers is
indispensable in order to guarantee inclusion of all diverse and
competing values, opinions, and claims. Moreover, a structured
communication path is needed to meet the requirements of a risk
governance process. Finally, a win-win-situation among the involved
actors has to be created to reach an agreement on common goals and
actions to achieve them in due time.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper presents a method to identify intense warm season storms with
convective character based on intensity thresholds and the presence of
lightning, and analyzes their statistical properties. Long records of
precipitation and lightning data at 4 stations and 10 min resolution in
different climatological regions in Switzerland are used. Our premise is
that thunderstorms associated with lightning generate bursts of high
rainfall intensity. We divided all recorded storms into those
accompanied by lightning and those without lightning and found the
threshold I{*} that separates intense events based on peak 10 min
intensity I-p >= I{*} for a chosen misclassification rate alpha. The
performance and robustness of the selection method was tested by
investigating the inter-annual variability of I{*} and its relation to
the frequency of lightning strikes. The probability distributions of the
main storm properties (rainfall depth R, event duration D, average storm
intensity I-a and peak 10 min intensity I-p) for the intense storm
subsets show that the event average and peak intensities are
significantly different between the stations. Nonparametric correlations
between the main storm properties were estimated for intense storms and
all storms including stratiform rain. The differences in the
correlations between storm subsets are greater than those between
stations, which indicates that care must be exercised not to mix events
of different origin when they are sampled for multivariate analysis, for
example, copula fitting to rainfall data.

T1  - A METHOD FOR IDENTIFICATION OF SMALL CARPATHIAN CATCHMENTS MORE PRONE TO FLASH FLOOD GENERATION. BASED ON THE EXAMPLE OF SOUTH-EASTERN PART OF THE POLISH CARPATHIANS
A1  - Bryndal, Tomasz
Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - The European Union has obligated all Members States, to perform a
preliminary assessment to identify the catchments at risk of flooding.
Usually, hydro-meteorological data and historical information about
flooding are used to determine whether a catchment is at risk of
flooding or not. Such information is missing for many small Carpathian
catchments. Therefore, a method, enabling identification of small
catchments more prone to flash flood generation, was proposed. The
method focused on physiographic parameters of catchment. Eighty-five
catchments where flash floods were well-documented, were described by
physiographic parameters. The parameters described dimension, shape,
relief, hydrological and geological conditions and land use. Then, the
influence of those parameters on flash flood formation process was
studied. The results revealed that physiographic parameters of those
catchments made them more sensitive to flash flood generation. On the
basis of these parameters, types of the Carpathian catchments more prone
to flash flood generation were created. The method was tested in
south-eastern part of the Polish Carpathians. Catchments resembling the
types were identified within a group of 366 catchment located in this
area. The results revealed that many flash flood events recorded in the
study area, had taken place within catchments identified by use of the
method. This fact suggests that the method enable to identify catchments
more prone to flash flooding in the geographical space. Therefore, the
method may be a valuable tool in the process of flood risk management in
the Carpathians.

AB  - Accurate estimates of flood peaks, corresponding volumes, and
hydrographs are required to design safe and cost-effective hydraulic
structures. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach for the
estimation of the design variables peak and volume by constructing
synthetic design hydrographs for different flood types such as
flash-floods, short-rain floods, long-rain floods, and rain-on-snow
floods. Our approach relies on the fitting of probability density
functions to observed flood hydrographs of a certain flood type and
accounts for the dependence between peak discharge and flood volume. It
makes use of the statistical information contained in the data and
retains the process information of the flood type. The method was tested
based on data from 39 mesoscale catchments in Switzerland and provides
catchment specific and flood type specific synthetic design hydrographs
for all of these catchments. We demonstrate that flood type specific
synthetic design hydrographs are meaningful in flood-risk management
when combined with knowledge on the seasonality and the frequency of
different flood types.

AB  - Mountainous terrain covers nearly half of China and is susceptible to
floods, which can lead to substantial losses of human life and property.
Historical flooding records from government bulletins and newspapers,
the only available information regarding floods that have occurred in
some mountainous areas, are valuable for understanding flood disaster
mechanisms in these regions. In this study, the flood susceptibility in
mountainous regions in China was mapped based on historical flooding
records from 1949 to 2000. A Random Forest (RF) model, which can handle
large datasets through factor contribution analysis, was chosen to
characterize the relationships between flooding occurrences and twelve
geographic, meteorological, and hydrological explanatory factors. The
results indicate that the RF model can effectively identify flood-prone
areas and has advantages over artificial neural network (ANN) and
support vector machine (SVM) methods. Among these explanatory factors,
the geographic factors (elevation, longitude and drainage density) are
the most important predictors of flooding in China's mountainous areas,
whereas the hydrological factors (relative elevation and curve number)
are the least important. Two independent datasets of historical flooding
events from the Bulletin of Flood and Drought Disasters in China
(2006-2014) alongside news reports and yearbooks (2008-2014) were
collected and chosen to validate the capability of the RF model. The
validation results confirm that the RF model can identify the flood
susceptibility with satisfactory accuracy. This study proposes a
preliminary flood susceptibility map of mountainous areas in China and
provides a reference for predicting and mitigating potentially
disastrous flooding events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2006///
PD  - 
AB  - Rainfall variability in Australia is generally among the highest in the
world, largely due to the dominant influence of the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. Australian climate has been characterized by wet and dry
periods with sometimes sudden transitions from one mode to the other.
Synoptic explanations and teleconnections are discussed, with an
emphasis on the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). Floods in Australia are
generally of two types: local ``flash floods{''} and widespread basin
flooding. The latter often start in the upper reaches of the MDB due to
tropical low-pressure systems, and slowly move downstream. Floods in
smaller subcatchments can be rapid and intense due to heavy
thunderstorms or other instability exacerbated by topography.
Global warming due to human activities is occurring. Observed rainfall
trends may be partly natural but partly of human origin. Possible
changes to rain-bearing systems associated with tropical and midlatitude
systems will be discussed, along with land cover change and possible
effects on runoff, erosion, and sediment loading. The general picture
for the MDB, despite significant uncertainties, is that the frequency of
small catchment flash flooding is likely to increase, especially in
autumn and winter and in summer over the northern and southern (but not
central) areas of the MDB. Large catchment floods may increase in
magnitude in summer in the northern parts of the Basin, but are less
likely to do so in the south, where average rainfall is likely to
decrease. Increased fire risk and decreased ground cover may lead to
greater sediment loading and erosion during floods, although
reforestation could slow runoff and decrease magnitudes of floods,
especially in the upper catchments.

Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - In solving the hyperbolic equations of environmental shallow water
flows, computational difficulty arises when the topography is irregular.
In particular, under a conventional operator-splitting framework, a very
small time step is often necessary to ensure stability, and this
limitation on the time step is dictated by the magnitude of the source
terms in relation to the irregular topography and inevitably increases
the computational cost. Here a practically efficient finite volume
algorithm is presented for solving the hyperbolic equations of shallow
water flows. The numerical solution is achieved under an
operator-splitting framework, a second-order weighted average flux (WAF)
total variation diminishing (TVD) method along with the Harten Lax van
Leer (HLL) approximate Riemann solver for the homogeneous equations, and
a Runge-Kutta scheme for the ordinary differential equations of source
terms. For numerical stability, a self-adaptive time step method is
proposed under the Runge-Kutta scheme. Numerical tests for a case of
glacier-lake outburst flooding demonstrate that the present model is
essentially free from the restriction on time step arising from
irregular topography, and therefore computational efficiency is
substantially enhanced. The model is benchmarked with an urban flooding
event in Glasgow, UK, and the modelling results are in reasonable
agreement with those attained by others from the Flood Risk Management
Research Consortium, UK.

AB  - Spatial patterns of daily precipitation indices and their temporal
trends over Iran are investigated using the APHRODITE gridded daily
precipitation dataset for the period 1961-2004. The performance and
limitations of the gridded dataset are checked against observations at
ten rain-gauge stations that are representative of different climates in
Iran. Results suggest that the spatial patterns of the indices reflect
the role of orography and sea neighborhoods in differentiating
central-southern arid and semi-arid regions from northern and western
mountainous humid areas. It is also found that western Iran is impacted
by the most extreme daily precipitation events occurring in the country,
though the number of rainy days has its maximum in the Caspian Sea
region. The time series of precipitation indices is checked for
long-term trends using the least squares method and Mann-Kendall test.
The maximum daily precipitation per year shows upward trends in most of
Iran, though being statistically significant only in western regions. In
the same regions, upward trends are also observed in the number of wet
days and in the accumulated precipitation and intensity during wet days.
Conversely, the contribution of precipitation events below the 75th
percentile to the annual total precipitation is decreasing with time,
suggesting that extreme events are responsible for the upward trend
observed in the total annual precipitation and in the other indices.
This tendency towards more severe/extreme precipitation events, if
confirmed by other datasets and further analyses with longer records,
would require the implementation of adequate water resources management
plans in western Iran aimed at mitigating the increasing risk of intense
precipitation and associated flash floods and soil erosion.

AB  - This paper identifies the underlying causes and damages caused by 2010
flash flood, which is considered one of the worst hydrological disasters
in the country (Pakistan). Questionnaire based survey and structured
interviews were conducted to investigate physical and economic damages
in the selected case study Dir Valley. Global Positioning System (GPS)
survey was also conducted to acquire location of damages and
Geographical Information System (GIS) is used to visualize land use,
land cover and damage data. Buffer analysis is used to delineate the
effected strata on both sides of Panjkora River to assess the flood
damages. Climate change phenomenon along with peculiar topography of the
region are considered as the underlying causes as monsoon winds
interacted with the jet stream abnormally causing unprecedented high
intensity rainfall in the valley. The steep topography of the area
caused rain water to accumulate rapidly in the Panjkora River,
overpowering the withholding capacity of the river. The phenomenon
resulted in severe flash flood which annihilated whatever came in its
way. Upper zone in the target area is badly affected by flood with
maximum damaged houses and human causalities followed by lower zone with
high number of damaged bridges. This study will bring the attention of
disaster management and other relevant authorities to focus on flood
risk reduction by enhancing the retention capability of watershed in
upstream areas that will reduce the risk in low lying areas. (C) 2016

T1  - Impacts of surface mine valley fills on headwater floods in eastern Kentucky
A1  - Phillips, J D
Y1  - 2004///
PD  - 
AB  - The potential impacts of valley fills associated with mountaintop
removal/valley fill (MTR/VF) coal mining on downstream flooding in the
coalfields of eastern Kentucky and adjacent states are a subject of
public debate and scientific uncertainty. This study explored two
aspects of this issue. First, hydrologic indices of relative runoff
production and surface and subsurface flow detention were applied to
conditions typical of headwater and low-order drainage basins in eastern
Kentucky. Results show that there is a clear risk of increased flooding
(greater runoff production and less surface flow detention) following
MTR/VF operations, and suggest that, on balance, valley fills are more
likely to increase rather than decrease flood potential. However, there
is a wide range of outcomes, qualitatively and quantitatively. Flood
risks can be increased or decreased, and the degree of either may vary
markedly. The effects of MTR/VF mining on downstream peak flows are
highly contingent on local pre- and post-mining conditions, and it would
be unwise to apply generalizations to specific sites. Second, the
occurrence of flash floods downstream of MTR/VF operations when nearby
unmined areas did not flood or had less severe floods has frequently
been explained (without supporting data) in terms of locally greater
precipitation. The likelihood of such short-range variability of storm
precipitation is evaluated by applying the state probability function to
NEXRAD radar estimates of precipitation for two 2001 storms which
produced flash floods in eastern Kentucky. The spatial structure of the
storm precipitation indicates that at the scale of the analysis (pixel
size of approximately 2 km) large local variations in storm
precipitation are unlikely-that is, the probability of nearby hollows or
low-order drainage basins receiving substantially different storm
precipitation totals is low.

A1  - Morss, Rebecca E
Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - To complement other flood mitigation measures, hydrometeorological
predictions are often used in decisions leading up to and during floods.
Understanding the role played by predictions in flood events can help
forecasters provide more useful information, and it can help decision
makers use this information more effectively as part of broader flood
loss-reduction strategies. This article examines the interactions among
predictions, decisions, and flood-related outcomes by analyzing three
cases of severe flooding in the United States: the Red River basin flood
of April 1997 in Grand Forks and Fargo, N. D.; the Fort Collins, Colo.
flood in July 1997; and the Pescadero Creek basin, California flood in
February 1998. The floods occurred in different hydrometeorological and
societal circumstances, had different types of predictive information
available, and had different societal impacts, providing an opportunity
to compare and contrast lessons learned. Issues explored include the
interplay between the floods and their hydrometeorological and societal
context and the roles of predictions and predictive uncertainty in
decisions and outcomes.

AB  - The island of Ischia is particularly susceptible to landslides and flash
floods due to its particular geological and geomorphological context.
Urbanization in recent decades coupled with the development of tourism
has increased the risk. After the November 10, 2009 event occurring in
the northern sector of the island (the town of Casamicciola), a detailed
geo-morphological survey was conducted to ascertain the evolution of the
phenomenon. In the watersheds upstream of Casamicciola, many landslides
were mapped and the volume of material involved during detachment and
sliding was estimated. In the lower course area, near the town and
towards the sea, flow pathways were reconstructed with the aid of
extensive video footage taken during the event. Rainfall data were also
analyzed and a relationship was established between the hourly rainfall
rate and the flash flood. The phenomenon was found to be quite complex,
with many upstream landslides stopping before reaching the urban area.
In the lower course the alluvial event occurred as a flood with a very
small sediment discharge, which left a very thin layer of sediment.
Reconstruction of the flash flood phenomenon suggested possible action
for future risk mitigation, early warning and civil protection plans.

PD  - 
AB  - The study focuses on circumstances that affect people during periods of
bad weather conditions characterised by winds, rainfall, landslides,
flooding, and storm surges. A methodological approach and its
application to a study area in southern Italy are presented here. A
10-yr database was generated by mining data from a newspaper. Damaging
agents were sorted into five types: flood, urban flooding, landslide,
wind, and storm surge. Damage to people occurred in 126 cases, causing
13 victims, 129 injured and about 782 people involved but not injured.
For cases of floods, urban flooding and landslides, the analysis does
not highlight straightforward relationships between rainfall and damage
to people, even if the events showed different features according to the
months of occurrence. The events occurring between May and October were
characterised by concentrated and intense rainfall, and between May and
July, the highest values of hourly (103 mm on the average) and monthly
rainfall (114 mm on the average) were recorded. Urban flooding and flash
floods were the most common damaging agents: injured, involved people
and more rarely, cases with victims were reported.
Between November and April, the highest number of events was recorded.
Rainfall presented longer durations and hourly and sub-hourly rainfall
were lower than those recorded between May and October. Landslides were
the most frequent damaging agents but the highest number of cases with
victims, which occurred between November and January, were mainly
related to floods and urban flooding.
Motorists represent the totality of the victims; 84% of the people were
injured and the whole of people involved. All victims were men, and the
average age was 43 yr. The primary cause of death was drowning caused by
floods, and the second was trauma suffered in car accidents caused by
urban flooding. The high number of motorists rescued in sub-merged cars
reveals an underestimation of danger in the case of floods, often
increased by the sense of security related to the familiarity of the
road. In contrast, in the cases of people involved in landslides, when
there was enough time to realise the potential risk, people behaved
appropriately to avoid negative consequences. Of the victims, 50% were
killed along fast-flowing roads; this may be related to the high speed
limit in force on these roads, as a car's speed reduces the reaction
time of a driver's response to an unexpected situation, whatever the
damaging agent is. These results can be used in local
information/education campaigns to both increase risk awareness and
promote self-protective behaviours.
Moreover, the mapping of damaging effects pointed out the regional
sectors in which the high frequency of the events suggests further
planning of in-depth examinations, which can individuate the critical
points and local regulator interventions that might change damage
incidences in the future.

AB  - The January 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti left its population
ever more vulnerable to rainfall-induced flash floods. A flash flood
guidance system has been implemented to provide real-time information on
the potential of small (similar to 70 km(2)) basins for flash flooding
throughout Haiti. This system has components for satellite rainfall
ingest and adjustment on the basis of rain gauge information, dynamic
soil water deficit estimation, ingest of operational mesoscale model
quantitative precipitation forecasts, and estimation of the times of
channel flow at bankfull. The result of the system integration is the
estimation of the flash flood guidance (FFG) for a given basin and for a
given duration. FFG is the amount of rain of a given duration over a
small basin that causes minor flooding in the outlet of the basin.
Amounts predicted or nowcasted that are higher than the FFG indicate
basins with potential for flash flooding. In preparation for Hurricane
Tomas' landfall in early November 2010, the FFG system was used to
generate 36-h forecasts of flash flood occurrence based on rainfall
forecasts of the nested high-resolution North American Model of the
National Centers for Environmental Prediction. Assessment of the
forecast flood maps and forecast precipitation indicates the utility and
value of the forecasts in understanding the spatial distribution of the
expected flooding for mitigation and disaster management. It also
highlights the need for explicit uncertainty characterization of
forecast risk products due to large uncertainties in quantitative
precipitation forecasts on hydrologic basin scales.

PD  - 
AB  - The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is one of largest river deltas and
metropolitan areas in the world with strong human interference, so it is
vulnerable to extreme weather events. Based on daily precipitation
dataset of 16 rain gauges in Yangtze River Delta and Mann-Kendall trend
detection techniques, the trend in annual and seasonal precipitation
extremes has been investigated in the period 1957-2013. Possible links
between changes in extreme precipitation and monsoon indices have also
been explored. The results show that: (1) the increasing trends of
consecutive wet days, maximum daily precipitation, maximum 5-day
precipitation and maximum precipitation amount in the past 57 years in
YRD can be detected. Much attention should be paid to higher risk of
flash flood in these areas, especially in big cities of Shanghai,
Nanjing, Hangzhou and Ningbo. (2) Both precipitation days and amount of
heavy events (defined as over 90th, 95th and 99th) exhibit overwhelming
upward tendency in summer and winter throughout YRD. The summer is to
meet with heavier precipitation events as result of larger increasing
magnitude in heavy rain days and amounts in the past 57 years. So, high
importance should be placed on the relief for flood in summer in the
large cites. (3) There is an abrupt change point for extreme
precipitation events, and increased annual total precipitation has
impact on the upward tendency of heavy rainfall events in YRD on great
scale. In addition, the significant correlations between indices (P90,
P95, R90 and R95) and monsoon indices (East Asian Summer Monsoon Index
and South Asia Summer Monsoon Index) indicate that extreme precipitation
events are related to the EASMI and SASMI. Therefore, these properties
of precipitation extremes are of great significance to the control of
natural hazards in YRD with high degree of human activities and
understanding the impact of climate change on hydrologic processes.

AB  - Riyadh, the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has experienced
unusual levels of urbanization in the past few decades, making it one of
the fastest growing cities in the world. This paper examines flood
hazards in the rapidly urbanizing catchment of Al-Aysen in Riyadh.
Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were
employed to obtain and prepare input data for hydrologic and hydraulic
models, with the former based on the very popular curve number approach.
Due to the limited nature of the rainfall data, observations from two
rain gauges in the vicinity of the catchment were used to estimate
design storms. The hydrologic model was run in a semi-distributed mode
by dividing the catchment into many sub-catchments. The impact of
urbanization on run-off volume and peak discharge resulting from
different storms was investigated, with various urbanization scenarios
simulated. Flood hazard zones and affected streets were also identified
through hydrologic/hydraulic model simulation. The mismatch between
administrative and catchment boundaries can create problems in flood
risk management for similar cities since hydrologic processes and flood
hazards are based on the hydrologic connectivity. Since flooding events
impact the road network and create driving hazards, governmental
decision-makers must take the necessary precautions to protect drivers
in these situations.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - The village of Pajares de Pedraza (Segovia, Spain) is located in the
floodplain of the Cega River, a left bank tributary of the Douro River.
Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its
upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable
lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River
overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to
homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013
and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify
the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas.
Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood
frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and
characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2D hydraulic modeling
(Iber 2.0 software) based on LIDAR (1 m) topography and considering
three different scenarios associated with the initial construction
(1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure
(rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population.
Specific stage-damage functions were expressly developed using in situ
data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on
urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit
value were established. The relationship between water depth and the
height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. were
located was analyzed; due to its effect on the form of the function.
Other nonspecific magnitude-damage functions were used in order to
compare both economic estimates.
The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude-damage
functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses,
partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a
detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is
the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial
losses. In both cases, this should include a consideration of the
socio-economic and cultural conditions prevailing in the area, as well
as the types of flood that affect it. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - This paper focuses on the influence of mountain rain-on-snow (ROS)
events that can on occasion trigger major floods in alpine catchments.
In order to assess the evolution of these events in a recent past, and
the potential changes that could be experienced in a changing climate
over coming decades, we have focused on a small catchment in
north-eastem Switzerland, the Sitter, well-endowed with both climate and
hydrological data. Observations show that there has been an increase in
the nuinber of rain-on-snow events since the early 1960s related to the
rise in atmospheric temperatures. Results from a simple
temperature-based snow model show that the number of ROS events could
increase by close to 50% with temperatures 2-4 degrees C warmer than
today, before declining when temperatures go beyond 4 degrees C. The
likelihood of more ROS events suggests that the risks of flooding in a
future climate may indeed get worse before they improve. (C) 2016

T1  - Rainfall thresholds for flood triggering. The case of Marathonas in Greece
A1  - Diakakis, Michalis
Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - Basins across Mediterranean coast are often subject to rapid inundation
phenomena caused by intense rainfall events. In this flash flooding
regime, common practices for risk mitigation involve hydraulic modeling,
geomorphic, and hydrologic analysis. However, apart from examining the
intrinsic characteristics of a basin, realistic flood hazard assessment
requires good understanding of the role of climatic forcing. In this
work, peak rainfall intensities, total storm accumulation, average
intensity, and antecedent moisture conditions of the 52 most important
storms in record, during the period from 1993 to 2008, in northeast
Attica, in Greece, are examined to investigate whether there is a
correlation between specific rainfall conditions and flood triggering in
the area. For this purpose, precipitation data from a network of five
rain gauges installed across the study area were collected and analyzed.
Storms totals, average intensity, antecedent moisture conditions, and
peak intensities variations were calculated and compared with local
flooding history. Results showed that among these rainfall measures,
only peak storm intensity presents a significant correlation with flood
triggering, and a rainfall threshold above which flooding becomes highly
probable can be defined.

death rates between the sexes was small at ages 19 and younger but males
died at twice the rate of females for ages 40 and older. Elevated deaths
rates were found for both males and females under age 5 and over 60.
Flooding events classified as flash floods accounted for most of the
fatalities. Vehicle-related flood deaths were concentrated in the Texas
Hill Country, the desert Southwest, the Ohio River Valley, and eastern
North Carolina.

Y1  - 2007///
PD  - 
AB  - A probabilistic model to assist decision makers in selecting the best
reservoir operation strategy during flash floods is presented, based on
Bayesian networks calibrated with the results of a rainfall-runoff model
coupled with a reservoir operation model. During real-time operation,
rainfall recorded in the basin is used to make probabilistic predictions
of inflow discharge into the reservoir with a rainfall-runoff Bayesian
network. The reservoir Bayesian network takes these probabilistic
discharge values as input data and gives the probabilistic outflow
discharge and water level at future time steps for the different
operation strategies considered. From these probabilistic results, the
best strategy for the operation of the floodgate can be selected in
terms of the probability of maximum discharge downstream of the
reservoir and risk of damage to the dam. Two data sets of 4000 inflow
hydrographs were obtained through Monte Carlo simulation with a
rainfall-runoff model and a reservoir management model. The Bayesian
networks learned from the first data set and were validated with the
second one. The methodology was tested successfully for one reservoir
located in the south of Spain with observed data recorded during a
recent flood event, checking its usefulness as a decision making tool in
real-time reservoir management.

PD  - 
AB  - The geographical position of the Bistrita River favours a rich liquid
run-off and great hydrotechnical potential. The Bistrita drainage basin
is strongly developed from the hydrotechnical point of view. Within the
drainage basin, numerous dams and storage reservoirs are installed with
the purpose of producing electricity and reducing flood hazards.
However, these structures could not stop floods at the drainage basin
level. The most powerful floods from Bistrita River basin and the role
in flood control of each of the storages are analysed in this paper. The
hydrological data have been collected from the monitoring network, where
the researchers elaborating this study are performing their daily
activity. The most powerful floods in the last century took place in
1970, 1991, 2005 and 2010. An intensification of the floods can be
noticed after the year 1990, a period which coincides with large-scale
deforestation of the small drainage basins. Disastrous floods occurred
as a consequence of summer heavy rains, with amounts of 100-200 mm
within 24 h. The most powerful floods were recorded in 2005 and
registered discharges up to 1,200 m(3)/s. Izvoru Muntelui reservoir, the
biggest in the system, can take most of the waters in excess. The
reservoirs located downstream are silting up, and the supplementary
flows cannot be absorbed entirely by storage. The exact knowledge of
flooding phenomena requires studies that can prevent and diminish the
damages caused by extreme hydrological events.

T1  - Floods in mountain environments: A synthesis

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Floods are a crucial agent of geomorphic change in the channels and
valley floors of mountains watercourses. At the same time, they can be
highly damaging to property, infrastructure, and life. Because of their
high energy, mountain watercourses are highly vulnerable to
environmental changes affecting their catchments and channels. Many
factors have modified and frequently still tend to modify the
environmental conditions in mountain areas, with impacts on geomorphic
processes and the frequency, magnitude, and timing of floods in mountain
watercourses. The ongoing climate changes vary between regions but may
affect floods in mountain areas in many ways. In many mountain regions
of Europe, widespread afforestation took place over the twentieth
century, considerably increasing the amounts of large wood delivered to
the channels and the likelihood of jamming bridges. At the same time,
deforestation continues in other mountain areas, accelerating runoff and
amplifying the magnitude and frequency of floods in foreland areas. In
many countries, in-channel gravel mining has been a common practice
during recent decades; the resultant deficit of bed material in the
affected channels may suddenly manifest during flood events, resulting
in the failure of scoured bridges or catastrophic channel widening.
During the past century many rivers in mountain and foreland areas
incised deeply; the resultant loss of floodplain water storage has
decreased attenuation of flood waves, hence increasing flood hazard to
downstream river reaches. On the other hand, a large amount of recent
river restoration activities worldwide may provide examples of
beneficial changes to flood risk, attained as a result of increased
channel storage or reestablished floodplain water storage. Relations
between geomorphic processes and floods operate in both directions,
which means that changes in flood probability or the character of floods
(e.g., increased wood load) may significantly modify the morphology of
mountain rivers, but morphological changes of rivers can also affect
hydrological properties of floods and the associated risk for societies.
This paper provides a review of research in the field of floods in
mountain environments and puts the papers of this special issue
dedicated to the same topic into context. It also provides insight into
innovative studies, methods, or emerging aspects of the relations
between environmental changes, geomorphic processes, and the occurrence
of floods in mountain rivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Y1  - 2006///
PD  - 
AB  - In the last few years, remote sensing observations have become a useful
tool for providing hydrological information, including the
quantification of the main physical characteristics of the catchment,
such as topography and land use, and of its variables, like soil
moisture or snow cover. Moreover, satellite data have also been largely
used in the framework of hydro-meteorological risk mitigation.
Recently, an innovative Soil Wetness Variation Index (SWVI) has been
proposed, using data acquired by the microwave radiometer AMSU (Advanced
Microwave Sounding Unit) which flies aboard NOAA (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration) satellites.
SWVI is based on a general approach for multi-temporal satellite data
analysis (RAT-Robust AVHRR Techniques). This approach exploits the
analysis of long-term multi-temporal satellite records in order to
obtain a former characterization of the measured signal, in term of
expected value and natural variability, providing a further
identification of signal anomalies by an automatic, unsupervised
change-detection step. Such an approach has already demonstrated, in
several studies carried out on extreme flooding events which occurred in
Europe in the past few years, its capability in reducing spurious
effects generated by natural/observational noise. In this paper, the
proposed approach is applied to the analysis of the flooding event which
occurred in Europe (primarily in NW Spain) in June 2000. Results
obtained, in terms of reliability as well as efficiency in space-time
monitoring of soil wetness variation, are presented. Future prospects,
in terms of exportability of the methodology on the new dedicated
satellite missions, like ESA-SMOS and NASA-HYDROS, are also discussed.

mechanisms and storm types producing these fatal flood events. Of the
ten classifications in the scheme, the two most dominant ascent
mechanisms associated with deadly floods include frontal boundaries

convective systems were responsible for 36% of the total number of
flood fatalities over the period. The ten classifications are spatially

Y1  - 2011///
PD  - 
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data, in addition to Geographic Information
Systems (GIS), offers an excellent alternative to conventional mapping
techniques in monitoring and mapping of geo-hazards areas. One of the
most sustainable development projects in Egypt has been accomplished in
Sinai, especially along and around the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gulf of
Suez. Variations along the coastal zone of the Gulf of Aqaba have been
identified through the analysis of multi-temporal satellite images with
the aid of GIS analysis. The study area is subject to rapid and
increasing changes in land-use/land-cover that resulting from natural
and human activities such as flash flooding, seismic activity,
landslides, and tourist and urban activities. This is in addition to the
construction projects of roads, ports, PowerStation stations, mineral
exploration, beaches, and tourist villages resulting from major
environmental impacts. The current study aims to use Remote Sensing and
GIS tools to investigate, monitor, and assess geo-hazards through the
building of a geographical database. Several techniques have been
developed over the last decade mostly to study the geological and
geomorphologic characteristics of the terrain; land-use and land-cover
changes. These are based on satellite imagery and Digital Elevation
Models (DEM) to determine the topographic features, and geo-hazards
maps. It is concluded that integrated approaches to monitoring can
successfully be used to assess the environmental impacts along the Gulf
of Aqaba coastal zone.

AB  - As a result of several serious flood events which have occurred since
2000, flooding across Europe is now receiving considerable public and
media attention. The impact of land use on hydrology and flood response
is significantly under-researched, and the links between land use change
and flooding are still unclear. This study considers runoff data
available from studies of arable in-field land use management options,
applied with the aim of reducing diffuse pollution from arable land, in
order to investigate whether these treatments also have potential to
reduce downstream flooding. Intensive monitoring of 17 hillslope
treatment areas produced a record of flood peak data covering different
mitigation treatments for runoff which occurred in the winter of
2007-2008. We investigated event total runoff responses to rainfall,
peak runoff, and timing of the runoff peaks from replicates of different
treatments, in order to assess whether there is a significant difference
in flood peak response between different mitigation options which could
be used to mitigate downstream flood risk. A mixed-modelling approach
was adopted in order to determine whether differences observed in runoff
response were significant. The results of this study suggest that
changes in land use management using arable in-field mitigation
treatments can affect local-scale runoff generation, with differences
observed in the size, duration and timing of flood peaks as a result of
different management practices, but the study was unable to allow
significant treatment effects to be determined. We suggest that further
field studies of the effects of changes in land use and land use
management need to upscale towards farm and catchment scale experiments
which consider high quality before-and-after data over longer temporal
timescales. This type of data collection is essential in order to allow
appropriate land use management decisions to be made. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB  - Watershed prioritization based on the natural and anthropogenic factors
involves by locating the critical areas of flood hazard, which cause
socio-economic and environmental consequences to take up mitigation
activities on priority basis. The pair-wise comparisons of natural and
anthropogenic factors is a bit problematic, because these two mentioned
factors are different from typology view point. In order to assess flood
hazard potential by using (1) only natural factors (FHPNF), (2) only
anthropogenic factors (FHPAF), and (3) ensemble the obtained
sub-watersheds priorities from natural and anthropogenic factors, the
coupling of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographical
Information Systems (GIS) were applied the Gorganrood river basin of
Iran. Each effective factor was assigned to appropriate weight based on
Saaty's 9 point scale and the obtained weights were normalized through
the Eigenvector method. By using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC),
two flood hazard potential indexes were defined separately for
anthropogenic and natural factors. Finally, both indices values were
combined to determine sub-watersheds priority. For the validation of the
predictions, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and
historical data of flash flood events were used. According to the
results of ROC curves, the FHPNF and FHPAF maps showed a reasonable good
performance in watershed prioritization with area under ROC curve (AUC)
values of 76.1 and 79.5 %, respectively. In addition, these results
imply that one and two sub-watersheds fall under very high and high
priority, respectively. The results of this study act as guidelines for
managers and planners to determine sub-watersheds priority and rational
management of watersheds based on both natural and anthropogenic
components.

T1  - Floods triggered by natural conditions and by human activities in a Mediterranean coastal environment
A1  - Sala, M
Y1  - 2003///
PD  - 
AB  - The occurrence of high intensity storm rainfall in the western
Mediterranean results in severe and often catastrophic flooding. In the
Catalan coastal catchments alone, located in the northeaste of the
Iberian peninsula, 296 zones have been estimated to be at risk from
flooding. The change in catchment response to rainfall induced by
urbanisation is one of the most dramatic of human impacts on the
hydrological cycle. The basic effect of the increment of urban
impervious areas on the rainfall-runoff processes is to increase storm
runoff, thus increasing flood potential. Major trends of land use
changes in the Mediterranean coastal streams show a marked progressive
increment of the urbanised areas, basically related to tourist
development of the coast. This study presents the characteristics of
intense storm rainfall and flash flooding, which occur in the Ridaura
catchment, located near the northeastern Spanish coast. The maximum
daily rainfall values associated with significant runoff events are in
the order of 200 mm over a 24 hours period and a recurrence interval of
7 to 10 years. The discharges resulting from the rainfall events are
approximately 200 to 250 m(3)/s and produce flooding in the downstream
summer resort of Platja d'Aro.

T1  - Flood risk in unplanned settlements in Lusaka
A1  - Nchito, Wilma S
Y1  - 2007///
PD  - 
AB  - Flooding in unplanned settlements in Lusaka is expected, even in years
of normal rainfall. There is always much discussion of needed action
when flooding occurs but, as soon as the seasonal rains stop, the
incidents are forgotten. Most of the households affected by flooding are
poor and the flooding damages or destroys their homes and belongings,
which might have taken years to accrue. Poorer groups may be faulted for
settling on sites at risk from flooding, but this is usually because
they can find no safer alternative. In addition, as this paper shows,
reducing flood risks in one settlement can increase flood risks in
others. Local authorities need to be vigilant in stopping settlement in
unstable zones and they need to increase awareness of the need for
action in settlements already built in flood-prone areas. Ways also need
to be sought to provide low-income households with alternatives to
informal settlements in flood-prone sites. It is hard to stop people
from erecting houses where they see vacant land. Since rain in Zambia is
seasonal, many marshy areas have been built on during dry periods only
to be flooded when the rains come. In the end, it is the poor who lose
and a solution needs to be found before more lives and property are
lost.

PD  - 
AB  - This work focuses on the analysis of vehicle-related flood fatalities in
Greece, in an effort to provide a better understanding on the
circumstances under which they occur. Therefore, an inventory of 60
fatalities associated with the use of vehicles, induced during 37 flood
events between 1970 and 2010, was studied. To this end, we developed a
database consisting of variables that provided a systematic description
of the circumstances under which each incident occurred, including
details of the surrounding environment, the road infrastructure,
specifics on the incident and demographic details of the involved
individuals. Analysis showed an increase in vehicle-related cases over
the period of study, with the majority of the incidents occurring after
1990. Males, and individuals between 40 and 69 years old, showed an
increased representation among both the drivers and the victims,
although the latter showed an overrepresentation of young individuals as
well. Most events occurred during nighttime and in rural areas of the
country. With respect to the surroundings, most cases occurred on paved
road network and bridges that proved vulnerable to flooding phenomena.
In a significant number of cases, fatal incidents occurred on paved
river crossings, constructed on the riverbed of usually dry torrents or
waterways. Drowning was found to be the primary cause of death. Analysis
of the drivers' actions, exactly before the incident, showed that in the
majority of occasions, they chose to enter into flooded areas, either to
travel across or to save someone, or recover something. In some cases,
vehicle occupants found themselves in a hazardous position when
floodwaters rose unexpectedly, giving them no chance to avoid danger. It
was therefore found that drivers, pursued an active, rather than a
passive, stance in the majority of incidents, attributed, in certain
occasions, to an underestimation of risk.

T1  - An inter-basin backwater overflow (the Buhai Brook and the Ezer reservoir on the Jijia River, Romania)

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - During the last few years, the north-western part of Romania has been
affected by catastrophic floods with most of the watercourses reaching
their highest recorded discharges. This study reports the generation of
a numerical terrain model and the simulation of a backwater phenomenon
at elevation steps according to the volume of water accumulated at the
confluence of the Buhai Brook with the Jijia River. The hydrological
data are complemented by rainfall data and the careful recording of the
flood behaviour during the entire period of its development. The main
aim of the study is to identify the causes of the backwater phenomenon
and to highlight the material damage inflicted on the town of Dorohoi.
At the same time, the study uses cartographic model that was developed
to establish which areas are at risk of flooding at various levels of
probability. The catastrophic flood began on the Buhai Brook, a
slow-flowing stream that drains the areas to the west of the town of
Dorohoi and discharged into the upstream sector of the Jijia confluence.
The flood caused two types of backwater waves: one behind the bridges
and the houses built on the floodplain and a second that followed the
course of the main stem (Jijia) upstream from the confluence, flooding
the Ezer Lake, which was created specifically to attenuate such floods.
The spillway backwater phenomenon was inter-basin as it did not occur in
a single hydrographic basin. The causes of the catastrophic flash flood
and of the inter-basin backwater overflow are natural but also reflect
anthropogenic influence. After the lake filled, the discharge into the
Jijia was controlled and the flooding downstream was thus greatly
diminished. Though fortuitous, the backwater flooding was important in
mitigating the impact of the flood wave from the Jijia River. Copyright

AB  - A flash flood is an event that develops rapidly. Given early warnings
with sufficient lead time, flood forecasting can help people prepare
disaster prevention measures. To provide this early warning, a
statistics-based flood forecasting model was developed to evaluate the
flooding potential in urban areas using ensemble quantitative
precipitation forecasts (the Taiwan Cooperative Precipitation Ensemble
Forecast Experiment, TAPEX). The proposed model uses different sources
of information, such as (i) the designed capacity of storm sewer
systems, (ii) a flood inundation potential database, and (iii)
historical flooding observations, to evaluate the potential for flash
flooding situations to occur. Using 24-, 48- and 72-h ahead
precipitation forecasts from the TAPEX, the proposed model can assess
the flooding potential with two levels of risk and at the township scale
with a 3-day lead time. The proposed model is applied to Pingtung
County, which includes 33 townships and is located in southern Taiwan. A
dataset of typhoon storms from 2010 to 2014 was used to evaluate the
model performance. The accuracy and threat score for testing events are
0.68 and 0.30, respectively, with a lead time of 24 h. The accuracy and
threat score for training events are 0.82 and 0.31, respectively, with a
lead time of 24 h. The model performance decreases when the lead time is
extended. However, the model demonstrates its potential as a valuable
reference to improve emergency responses to alleviate the loss of lives
and property due to flooding. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB  - This study focused on producing flash flood hazard susceptibility maps
(FFHSM) using frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI) models in
the Xiqu Gully (XQG) of Beijing, China. First, a total of 85 flash flood
hazard locations (n = 85) were surveyed in the field and plotted using
geographic information system (GIS) software. Based on the flash flood
hazard locations, a flood hazard inventory map was built. Seventy
percent (n = 60) of the flooding hazard locations were randomly selected
for building the models. The remaining 30% (n = 25) of the flooded
hazard locations were used for validation. Considering that the XQG used
to be a coal mining area, coalmine caves and subsidence caused by coal
mining exist in this catchment, as well as many ground fissures. Thus,
this study took the subsidence risk level into consideration for FFHSM.
The ten conditioning parameters were elevation, slope, curvature, land
use, geology, soil texture, subsidence risk area, stream power index
(SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), and short-term heavy rain. This
study also tested different classification schemes for the values for
each conditional parameter and checked their impacts on the results. The
accuracy of the FFHSM was validated using area under the curve (AUC)
analysis. Classification accuracies were 86.61%, 83.35%, and 78.52%
using frequency ratio (FR)-natural breaks, statistical index
(SI)-natural breaks and FR-manual classification schemes, respectively.
Associated prediction accuracies were 83.69%, 81.22%, and 74.23%,
respectively. It was found that FR modeling using a natural breaks
classification method was more appropriate for generating FFHSM for the
Xiqu Gully.

PD  - 
AB  - Large debris, including vehicles parked along floodplains, can cause
severe damage and significant loss of life during urban area
flash-floods. In this study, the authors validated and applied the
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model, developed in Amicarelli et
al. (2015), which reproduces in 3D the dynamics of rigid bodies driven
by free surface flows, to the design of flood mitigation measures. To
validate the model, the authors compared the model's predictions to the
results of an experimental setup, involving a dam breach that strikes
two fixed obstacles and three transportable floating bodies. Given the
accuracy of the results, in terms of water depth over time and the time
history of the bodies' movements, the SPH model explored in this study
was used to analyse the mitigation efficiency of a proposed structural
intervention - the use of small barriers (groynes) to prevent the
transport of floating bodies. Different groynes configurations were
examined to identify the most appropriate design and layout for urban
area flash flood damage mitigation. The authors found that groynes
positioned upstream and downstream of each floating body can be
effective as a risk mitigation measure for damage resulting from their
movement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - We analyse chronologies of historical flash floods derived from searches
of newspaper archives and other sources commencing before 1800 and
recent gauged rainfall and stream flow data. Five key examples are
chosen to illustrate specific features of flash floods. Pluvial flash
floods arise from rainfall before it reaches a watercourse and may cause
severe flooding of land and properties far from rivers. River flash
floods, like pluvial floods, have the characteristic of rapid speed of
response, a principal source of risk to life. Intense rainfall can
generate walls of water' in river courses which can propagate long
distances downstream and steepen, without upstream structural failure.
Steeply rising wavefronts more commonly occur on steep upland catchments
but, where intensities of extreme short period rainfall are sufficient,
such wavefronts can also occur on lowland catchments. A definition of
flash floods from intense rainfall, relevant to British landscape and
climate, is proposed.

Y1  - 2002///
PD  - 
AB  - A stochastic rainfall generator and a deterministic rainfall-runoff
model, both distributed in space and time, are combined to provide
accurate flood frequency prediction in the Bisagno River basin
(Thyrrenian Liguria, N.W.Italy). The inadequacy of streamflow records
with respect to the return period of the required flow discharges makes
the stochastic simulation methodology a useful operational alternative
to a regionalisation procedure for flood frequency analysis and derived
distribution techniques. The rainfall generator is the Generalized
Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulses (GNSRP) model. The rainfall-runoff model
is the FEST98 model. The GNSRP generator was calibrated using a
continuous 7-years' record of hourly precipitation measurements at five
raingauges scattered over the Bisagno basin. The calibrated rainfall
model was then used to generate a 1000 years' series of continuous
rainfall data at the gauging sites and a flood-oriented model validation
procedure was developed to evaluate the agreement between observed and
simulated extreme values of rainfall at different scales of temporal
aggregation. The synthetic precipitation series were input to the FEST98
model to provide flood hydrographs at selected cross-sections across the
river network. Flood frequency analysis of the annual flood series (AFS)
obtained from these simulations was undertaken using L-moment
estimations of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions. The
results are compared with those determined by applying a regional flood
analysis in Thyrrhenian Liguria and the derived distribution techniques
to the Bisagno river basin. This approach is also useful to assess the
effects of changes in land use on flood frequency regime (see Rosso and
Rulli, 2002).

AB  - Thunderstorms are often the cause of severe and disastrous flash floods.
Lightning activity within these storms can be detected and monitored
continuously from thousands of kilometers away and can therefore be very
useful in improving forecasts and now-casts of severe thunderstorms. An
improvement in the now-casting of such storms can assist in reducing
damages and saving lives.
Using the ZEUS ground-based VLF lightning detection network and the
Warning Decision Support System-Integrated Information (WDSS-II)
software, we performed now-casting simulations using 1 year of lightning
data over the Mediterranean area. Thousands of thunderstorms were
observed and now-cast 30, 60, 90 and 120 min ahead. Statistical analysis
was then done by calculating the hit, miss and false-alarm rates, as
well as the POD, FAR and CSI scores in order to determine the success of
the now-casting.
The results show that the algorithm is overall successful in now-casting
the location of the lightning clusters, especially when applied to
strong and consistent lightning events (it is these events which also
have the strongest connection to flash floods). The probability of
detection (POD) values range between 0.46 for 30 minute now-casts and
0.25 for 120 minute now-casts. The critical success index (CSI) values
are quite similar, but slightly lower. The now-casting has a low
false-alarm rate, 0.03 for 30 minute now-casts, which is also beneficial
for operational use.
This method has been implemented for the use in real-time now-casting
and is used in the EU FLASH project to seek and track areas of
thunderstorm risk according to lightning intensity. The experimental
now-casts appear on the project website (www.flashproject.org/). (C)

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - Extreme rainfall and flood events in steep upland catchments leave
geomorphological traces of their occurrence in the form of boulder
berms, debris cones, and alluvial fans. Constraining the age of these
features is critical to understanding (i) landscape evolution in
response to past, present, and future climate changes; and (ii) the
magnitude-frequency of extreme, ungauged floods in small upland
catchments. This research focuses on the Cambrian Mountains of Wales,
UK, where lichenometric dating of geomorphological features and
palaeohydrological reconstructions is combined with climatological data
and documentary flood records. Our new data from Wales highlight a
distinct flood-rich period between 1900 and 1960, similar to many other
UK lichen-dated records. However, this study sheds new light on the
underlying climatic controls on upland flooding in small catchments.
Although floods can occur in any season, their timing is best explained
by the Summer North Atlantic Oscillation (SNAO) and shifts between
negative (wetter than average conditions with regular cyclonic flow and
flooding) and positive phases (drier than average conditions with less
frequent cyclonic flow and flooding), which vary from individual summers
to decadal and multidecadal periods. Recent wet summer weather,
flooding, and boulder-berm deposition in the UK (2007-2012) are related
to a pronounced negative phase shift of the SNAO. There is also
increasing evidence that recent summer weather extremes in the
mid-latitudes may be related to Arctic amplification and rapid sea ice
loss. If this is the case, continuing and future climate change is
likely to mean that (i) unusual weather patterns become more frequent;
and (ii) upland UK catchments will experience heightened flood risk and
significant geomorphological changes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

PD  - 
AB  - In many regions of the world flood events in mountain basins are one of
the greatest risks to the local population, due to the pressure placed
on land use by social and economic development. Conventional
hydrologic-hydraulic methodological approaches are not usually feasible
in mountainous basins because they are not gauged at all or, in the
best-case scenario, are poorly gauged. In this context,
palaeohydrological research offers a valuable alternative to the above
approaches. However, many palaeohydrological data sources and associated
methods have been proposed and initially used in large basins with
extensive floodplains. As a result, when they are used in mountainous
areas they must be adapted to include different techniques, since the
problems to be addressed are different and less data is usually
available. In this paper, we review classic data sources and different
analytical methods and discuss their advantages and shortcomings with
particular attention to mountain basins. For this purpose, examples are
provided where improvements in the palaeohydrologic methods are proposed
by incorporating uncertainties, describing sources of error or putting
forward hypotheses for hydraulic calculation to make palaeoflood
hydrology more objective and useful in risk assessment. (C) 2014

AB  - Flood forecasts are essential to issue reliable flood warnings and to
initiate flood control measures on time. The accuracy and the lead time
of the predictions for head waters primarily depend on the
meteorological forecasts. Ensemble forecasts are a means of framing the
uncertainty of the potential future development of the hydro-
meteorological situation.
This contribution presents a flood management strategy based on
probabilistic hydrological forecasts driven by operational
meteorological ensemble prediction systems. The meteorological ensemble
forecasts are transformed into discharge ensemble forecasts by a
rainfall- runoff model. Exceedance probabilities for critical discharge
values and probabilistic maps of inundation areas can be computed and
presented to decision makers. These results can support decision makers
in issuing flood alerts. The flood management system integrates ensemble
forecasts with different spatial resolution and different lead times.
The hydrological models are controlled in an adaptive way, mainly
depending on the lead time of the forecast, the expected magnitude of
the flood event and the availability of measured data.
The aforementioned flood forecast techniques have been applied to a case
study. The Mulde River Basin ( South-Eastern Germany, Czech Republic)
has often been affected by severe flood events including local flash
floods. Hind-casts for the large scale extreme flood in August 2002 have
been computed using meteorological predictions from both the COSMO- LEPS
ensemble prediction system and the deterministic COSMO- DE local model.
The temporal evolution of a) the meteorological forecast uncertainty and
b) the probability of exceeding flood alert levels is discussed. Results
from the hindcast simulations demonstrate, that the systems would have
predicted a high probability of an extreme flood event, if they would
already have been operational in 2002. COSMO- LEPS showed a reasonably
good performance within a lead time of 2 to 3 days. Some of the
deterministic very short- range forecast initializations were able to
predict the dynamics of the event, but others underpredicted rainfall.
Thus a lagged average ensemble approach is suggested. The findings from
the case study support the often proposed added value of ensemble
forecasts and their probabilistic evaluation for flood management
decisions.

AB  - This paper deals with the risk assessment to alluvial fan flooding at
the piedmont zone of carbonate massifs of the southern Apennines chain
(southern Italy). These areas are prime spots for urban development and
are generally considered to be safer than the valley floors. As a
result, villages and towns have been built on alluvial fans which,
during intense storms, may be affected by flooding and/or debris flow
processes.
The study area is located at the foothills of the Maddalena mountains,
an elongated NW-SE trending ridge which bounds to the east the wide
intermontane basin of Vallo di Diano. The area comprises a wide detrital
talus (bajada) made up by coalescent alluvial fans, ranging in age from
the Middle Pleistocene to the Holocene. Historical analysis was carried
out to ascertain the state of activity of the fans and to identify and
map the zones most hit by past flooding. According to the information
gathered, the Sala Consilina fans would appear prone to debris flows; in
the past these processes have produced extensive damage and loss of life
in the urban area. The watershed basins feeding the fans have very low
response times and may produce debris flow events with high magnitudes.
Taking into account the historical damage, the fan surface morphology,
and the present urban development (street orientation and hydraulic
network), the piedmont area was zoned and various susceptibility classes
were detected. These results may represent a useful tool for studies
aiming at territorial hazard mapping and civil protection interventions.

AB  - Flash floods have occurred frequently in the urban areas of southern
China. An effective process-oriented urban flood inundation model is
urgently needed for urban storm-water and emergency management. This
study develops an efficient and flexible cellular automaton (CA) model
to simulate storm-water runoff and the flood inundation process during
extreme storm events. The process of infiltration, inlets discharge and
flow dynamics can be simulated with little preprocessing on commonly
available basic urban geographic data. In this model, a set of
gravitational diverging rules are implemented to govern the water flow
in a rectangular template of three cells by three cells of a raster
layer. The model is calibrated by one storm event and validated by
another in a small urban catchment in Guangzhou of southern China. The
depth of accumulated water at the catchment outlet is interpreted from
street-monitoring closed-circuit television (CCTV) videos and verified
by on-site survey. A good level of agreement between the simulated
process and the reality is reached for both storm events. The model
reproduces the changing extent and depth of flooded areas at the
catchment outlet with an accuracy of 4 cm in water depth. Comparisons
with a physically based 2-D model (FloodMap) show that the model is
capable of effectively simulating flow dynamics. The high computational
efficiency of the CA model can meet the needs of city emergency
management.

T1  - A European precipitation index for extreme rain-storm and flash flood early warning

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Extreme rain storms are known for triggering devastating flash floods in
various regions of Europe and particularly along the Mediterranean
coasts. Despite recent notable advances in weather forecasting, most
operational early warning systems for extreme rainstorms and flash
floods are still based on rainfall measurements from rain gauges and
weather radars, rather than on forecasts. As a result, warning lead
times are bounded to a few hours and warnings are usually issued when
the event is already taking place. This work proposes a novel early
warning system for heavy precipitation events in Europe, aimed at
identifying forecasts of extreme rainfall accumulations over short
durations and within small-size catchments prone to flash flooding. The
system is based on the recently developed European Precipitation Index
based on simulated Climatology (EPIC), which is calculated using
COSMO-LEPS ensemble weather forecasts and subsequently fitted with gamma
distributions at each time step of the forecast horizon. Probabilistic
exceedence of warning thresholds is calculated and alert points are
generated where potentially extreme events are detected. Comparison of
daily runs over 22 months with observed rainstorm events and flash
floods in Europe denotes a probability of detection up to 90%,
corresponding to 45 events correctly predicted, with average lead time
of 32 h. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal Meteorological Society

PD  - 
AB  - Floods are the leading cause of fatalities connected with natural
disasters in Texas. A combination of physiography and precipitation
often result in extreme hydrologic conditions that cause floods in the
state. This paper reviews flood-related fatalities in Texas between 1959
and 2008. Information on flood-fatality victims and the flood-causing
events was obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. The data
collected included the date, time, location, and weather conditions and
the gender and age of the flood victims. Comparison with other states
reveals that the size of the population of Texas is a major factor in
the increased number of fatalities. The data also suggest that driving
or walking into floodwaters may be responsible for more than 93% of
flood fatalities in Texas. Although most high-fatality counties are
located in the Texas ``Flash Flood Alley{''} that includes major urban
centers, normalization of fatality data shows that the flood-fatality
risk is actually higher in other areas of the state. The analysis also
indicates that the annual flood-fatality rates are decreasing
significantly. A combination of improved hydrometeorological
forecasting, educational programs aimed at enhancing public awareness of
flood risk and the seriousness of flood warnings, and timely and
appropriate action by local emergency and safety authorities will help
further reduce flood fatalities in Texas. (C) 2014 American Society of

PD  - 
AB  - Flash flood events are floods characterised by a very rapid response of
basins to storms, often resulting in loss of life and property damage.
Due to the specific space-time scale of this type of flood, the lead
time available for triggering civil protection measures is typically
short. Rainfall threshold values specify the amount of precipitation for
a given duration that generates a critical discharge in a given river
cross section. If the threshold values are exceeded, it can produce a
critical situation in river sites exposed to alluvial risk. It is
therefore possible to directly compare the observed or forecasted
precipitation with critical reference values, without running online
real-time forecasting systems. The focus of this study is the Mignone
River basin, located in Central Italy. The critical rainfall threshold
values are evaluated by minimising a utility function based on the
informative entropy concept and by using a simulation approach based on
radar data. The study concludes with a system performance analysis, in
terms of correctly issued warnings, false alarms and missed alarms.

PD  - 
AB  - The Saudi Arabia has harsh environmental conditions which enhance some
geomorphologic/geological processes more than in other areas. These
processes create different geological hazards. The general physiography
of the Saudi Arabia is characterized by the Red Sea coastal plains and
the escarpment foothills called Tihama, followed by the Arabian Shield
Mountains, the Arabian Shelf plateau and finally the Arabian Gulf
coastal plains. These types of geological hazards can be categorized
into sand accumulations, earth subsidence and fissures, flash floods,
problematic soils, slope stability problems, and karst problems. The
current study gives an overview of all these hazards with examples, as
well as develops a geo-hazard map for the Saudi Arabia. Our findings
indicate that the desert environment needs much concern and care.
National and international agencies have to join together with other
people to keep the system balanced and to reduce the resulting
geological hazards. Also, remedial measures should be proposed to avoid
and reduce these natural hazards.

PD  - 
AB  - Timely warning communication and decision making are critical for
reducing harm from flash flooding. To help understand and improve
extreme weather risk communication and management, this study uses a
mental models research approach to investigate the flash flood warning
system and its risk decision context. Data were collected in the
Boulder, Colorado area from mental models interviews with forecasters,
public officials, and media broadcasters, who each make important
interacting decisions in the warning system, and from a group modeling
session with forecasters. Analysis of the data informed development of a
decision-focused model of the flash flood warning system that integrates
the professionals' perspectives. Comparative analysis of individual and
group data with this model characterizes how these professionals
conceptualize flash flood risks and associated uncertainty; create and
disseminate flash flood warning information; and perceive how warning
information is ( and should be) used in their own and others' decisions.
The analysis indicates that warning system functioning would benefit
from professionals developing a clearer, shared understanding of flash
flood risks and the warning system, across their areas of expertise and
job roles. Given the challenges in risk communication and decision
making for complex, rapidly evolving hazards such as flash floods,
another priority is development of improved warning content to help
members of the public protect themselves when needed. Also important is
professional communication with members of the public about allocation
of responsibilities for managing flash flood risks, as well as improved
system-wide management of uncertainty in decisions.

AB  - This study was prompted by the occurrence of an extreme Damaging
geo-Hydrological Event (DHE) which occurred on October 25th 2011 and
which affected a wide area of the northern Mediterranean region. After
analysing the storm by means of the precipitation time series, the study
attempts to relate the October 25th 2011 DHE with a series of other DHEs
that occurred in the period 1954-2012, assessed via the use of
historical data and classified according to severity, with a Storm
Erosivity Indicator (Ra). The annual mean of the Ra value (2582 MJ mm
ha(-1) h(-1) y(-1)) confirmed that the study area is one of the European
regions with the highest rainfall erosivity level. A shift in storminess
during 1991-2012 with respect to 1954-1990 was observed. A return period
of 1000 years was calculated for the single storm erosivity of October
25th, which contributed to 84% of the total annual storm erosivity of
2011 A quite good agreement was found comparing DHE distribution and
severity with Ra anomalies over time. As a matter of fact, most of the
low severity DHEs (62.5%) occurred in years in which the Ra was below
the average value. Moreover, almost all DHEs (93%) ranging from
medium-to very high-severity occurred in years for which the Ra exceeded
the average value. With regard to the occurrence of the most severe DHE
classes, a threshold of the Ra and a recurrence time of approximately
3300 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) y(-1) and 12 years, respectively, were
identified. Finally, some evidences suggest that an increasing frequency
of DHEs is expected in the forthcoming years. It is argued that
understanding these issues is a major priority for future research in
order to improve land and urban planning strategies for preserving
people and the environment, leading ultimately to an effective risk
reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

documenting different research trajectories, and highlighting recent
developments, we make an argument in favor of more extensive use of tree
rings in flood analyses. We show how tree-ring data have been applied to
risk assessment and outline how the widespread distribution of
flood-affected trees can be used to improve the understanding of flood
processes. In addition, we outline new approaches and future
perspectives for the inclusion of woody vegetation in hazard
assessments, and end with new thematic perspectives.

AB  - Understanding how people view flash flood risks can help improve risk
communication, ultimately improving outcomes. This article analyzes data
from 26 mental models interviews about flash floods with members of the
public in Boulder, Colorado, to understand their perspectives on flash
flood risks and mitigation. The analysis includes a comparison between
public and professional perspectives by referencing a companion mental
models study of Boulder-area professionals. A mental models approach can
help to diagnose what people already know about flash flood risks and
responses, as well as any critical gaps in their knowledge that might be
addressed through improved risk communication. A few public interviewees
mentioned most of the key concepts discussed by professionals as
important for flash flood warning decision making. However, most
interviewees exhibited some incomplete understandings and misconceptions
about aspects of flash flood development and exposure, effects, or
mitigation that may lead to ineffective warning decisions when a flash
flood threatens. These include important misunderstandings about the
rapid evolution of flash floods, the speed of water in flash floods, the
locations and times that pose the greatest flash flood risk in Boulder,
the value of situational awareness and environmental cues, and the most
appropriate responses when a flash flood threatens. The findings point
to recommendations for ways to improve risk communication, over the long
term and when an event threatens, to help people quickly recognize and
understand threats, obtain needed information, and make informed
decisions in complex, rapidly evolving extreme weather events such as
flash floods.

AB  - With its exceptionally steep topography, wet climate, and active
faulting, landslides can be expected to occur in the Rwenzori Mountains.
Whether or not this region is prone to landsliding and more generally
whether global landslide inventories and hazard assessments are accurate
in data-poor regions such as the East African highlands are thus far
unclear. In order to address these questions, a first landslide
inventory based on archive information is built for the Rwenzori
Mountains. In total, 48 landslide and flash flood events, or
combinations of these, are found. They caused 56 fatalities and
considerable damage to road infrastructure, buildings, and cropland, and
rendered over 14,000 persons homeless. These numbers indicate that the
Rwenzori Mountains are landslide-prone and that the impact of these
events is significant. Although not based on field investigations but on
archive data from media reports and laymen accounts, our approach
provides a useful complement to global inventories overlooking this
region and increases our understanding of the phenomenon in the Rwenzori
Mountains. Considering the severe impacts of landslides, the population
growth and related anthropogenic interventions, and the likelihood of
more intense rainfall conditions, there is an urgent need to invest in
research on disaster risk reduction strategies in this region and other
similar highland areas of Africa.

AB  - Floods are among Earth's most common natural hazards, and they cause
major economic losses and seriously affect peoples' lives and health.
This paper addresses the development of a flood susceptibility
assessment that uses intelligent techniques and GIS. An adaptive
neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was coupled with a genetic
algorithm and differential evolution for flood spatial modelling. The
model considers thirteen hydrologic, morphologic and lithologic
parameters for the flood susceptibility assessment, and Hengfeng County
in China was chosen for the application of the model due to data
availability and the 195 total flood events. The flood locations were
randomly divided into two subsets, namely, training (70% of the total)
and testing (30%). The Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis
(SWARA) approach was used to assess the relation between the floods and
influencing parameters. Subsequently, two data mining techniques were
combined with the ANFIS model, including the ANFIS-Genetic Algorithm and
the ANFIS-Differential Evolution, to be used for flood spatial modelling
and zonation. The flood susceptibility maps were produced, and their
robustness was checked using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve. The results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for
allmodelswas > 0.80. The highest AUC value was for the ANFIS-DE model
(0.852), followed by ANFIS-GA (0.849). According to the RMSE and MSE
methods, the ANFIS-DE hybrid model is more suitable for flood
susceptibility mapping in the study area. The proposed method is
adaptable and can easily be applied in other sites for flood management
and prevention. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The 2 June 2008 flood-producing storm on the Starzel river basin in
South-West Germany is examined as a prototype for organized convective
systems that dominate the upper tail of the precipitation frequency
distribution and are likely responsible for the flash flood peaks in
Central Europe. The availability of high-resolution rainfall estimates
from radar observations and a rain gauge network, together with indirect
peak discharge estimates from a detailed post-event survey, provided the
opportunity to study in detail the hydrometeorological and hydrological
mechanisms associated with this extreme storm and the ensuing flood.
Radar-derived rainfall, streamgauge data and indirect estimates of peak
discharges are used along with a distributed hydrologic model to
reconstruct hydrographs at multiple locations. Observations and model
results are combined to examine two main questions, (i) assessment of
the distribution of the runoff ratio for the 2008 flash flood and how it
compares with other less severe floods; and (ii) analysis of how the
spatial and temporal distribution of the extreme rainfall, and more
specifically storm motion, controls the flood response. It is shown that
small runoff ratios (less than 20%) characterized the runoff response
and that these values are in the range of other, less extreme, flood
events. The influence of storm structure, evolution and motion on the
modeled flood hydrograph is examined by using the ``spatial moments of
catchment rainfall{''}. It is shown that downbasin storm motion (in the
range of 0.7-0.9 m s(-1)) had a noticeable impact on flood response by
increasing the modeled flood peak by 13 %.

PD  - 
AB  - Accurate flood forecasts are critical to an efficient flood event
management strategy. Until now, hydro-meteorological forecasts have
mainly been used to establish early-warnings in France (meteorological
and flood vigilance maps) or over the world (flash-flood guidances).
These forecasts are typically limited either to the main streams covered
by the flood forecasting services or to watersheds with specific assets
like check dams, which in most cases are well gauged river sections,
thus leaving aside large parts of the territory. This paper presents a
distributed hydro-meteorological forecasting approach, which makes use
of the high spatial and temporal resolution rainfall estimates that are
now available, to provide information at ungauged sites. The proposed
system intended to detect road inundation risks had initially been
developed and tested in areas of limited size. This paper presents the
extension of such a system to an entire region (i.e. the Gard region in
Southern France), including over 2000 crossing points between rivers and
roads and its validation with respect to a large data set of actual
reported road inundations observed during recent flash flood events.
These initial validation results appear to be most promising. The
eventual proposed tool would provide the necessary information for flood
event management services to identify the areas at risk and adopt
appropriate safety and rescue measures: i.e. pre-positioning of rescue
equipment, interruption of the traffic on the exposed roads and
determination of safe access or evacuation routes. Moreover, beyond the
specific application to the supervision of a road network, the research
undertaken herein also provides results for the performance of
hydro-meteorological forecasts on ungauged headwaters. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB  - Flash floods represent a frequently recurring natural phenomenon in the
Tatra Mountains. On the northern slopes of the mountain chain, located
in Poland, ongoing and expected future changes in climate are thought to
further increase the adverse impacts of flash floods. Despite the repeat
occurrence of major floods in the densely populated foothills of the
Polish Tatras, the headwaters have been characterized by a surprising
lack of data, such that any analysis of process variability or
hydrometeorological triggers has been largely hampered so far. In this
study, dendrogeomorphic techniques have been employed in four
poorly-gauged torrential streams of the northern slope of the Tatra
Mountains to reconstruct temporal and spatial patterns of past events.
Using more than 1100 increment cores of trees injured by past flash
floods, we reconstruct 47 events covering the last 148 years and discuss
synoptic situations leading to the triggering of flash floods with the
existing meteorological and flow gauge data. Tree-ring analyses have
allowed highlighting the seasonality of events, providing new insights
about potential hydrometeorological triggers as well as a
differentiating flash flood activity between catchments. Results of this
study could be useful to design future strategies to deal with flash
flood risks at the foothills of the Polish Tatras and in the Vistula
River catchment. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Y1  - 2008///
PD  - 
AB  - This paper builds on the `Flooding from Other Sources' project (HA4a),
funded as part of Defra's Making Space for Water strategy. The HA4a
study concluded that flood risk mapping is feasible for many of the
sources of flooding that were investigated, which are not currently
covered by the Environment Agency Flood Map, using existing flow
modelling and GIS tools. However, there are some major constraints in
terms of the need to undertake extensive data collection to allow the
generation of useful flood maps that are not dominated by modelling
uncertainties. The project anticipated that different levels of data
collection and modelling might be needed for different purposes, given
the hierarchical nature of UK flood risk assessment and management in
the United Kingdom under PPS25 and the EC Floods Directive. This paper
compares and contrasts three different approaches to urban flood
modelling using topographic analysis, blanket extreme rainfall and
semi-coupled sewer/overland routing. The UK summer floods 2007 have
highlighted the pressing need for mapping the risk from urban flash
flooding, and the Pitt Review has recommended that areas at high risk
from surface waters should be urgently identified. This can be done now
at some level of detail, and we can be guided as to what level, from our
increasing knowledge of vulnerable populations, from records of
historical flooding and by using some of the screening methods described
herein.

AB  - Flood events have often occurred in the metropolitan urban area of
Athens, capital of Greece, causing loss of property and in many cases
human lives. In this study a flood hazard assessment model for urban
areas is examined. The Kifisos and Ilisos Rivers flowing through the
plain of Athens was the case study of the present work. The quantitative
analysis of the Kifisos and Ilisos Rivers drainage networks was
performed to identify flash-flood prone areas. The major factors
affecting urban floods were estimated. The slope angle, elevation,
distance from open channel streams, distance from totally covered
streams, hydro-lithology and land cover of the study area were used. to
evaluate these factors the analytical hierarchical process method was
applied in a geographical information system. A sensitivity analysis was
made to assess the effect of the various factors on the flood hazard
map. Three scenarios were developed to examine the effect of uncertainty
of the factors' values to the flood hazard assessment results, leading
to the corresponding urban flood hazard assessment maps. The produced
map showed that the areas of very high flood hazard are located mostly
along the lower reaches of Kifisos and Ilisos Rivers, particularly to
the southern and to the western part of the study area. These areas are
characterized by lowland morphology, gentle slope, totally covered
streams, expansion of impermeable formation and intense urbanization.
The uncertainty analysis shows no significant differences on the spatial
distribution of the hazard zones. The produced urban flood hazard map
proves a satisfactory agreement between the flood hazard zones and the
spatial distribution of flood phenomena that have affected the study
area in the past 117 years. Furthermore, the comparison between the
floodprone areas that were derived from the geomorphological analysis of
the drainage networks and the high flood-hazard zones of the final map
indicated reliable results and a high accuracy of the proposed
methodology.

AB  - The Tangjiashan Quake Lake is the largest quake lake triggered by the
5.12 Wenchuan Earthquake that happened on May 12, 2008 in China, posing
high risk of catastrophic flash flood hazards to downstream human life
and properties. A physics-based numerical simulation approach is
proposed for real-time prediction of dam breach development of the
Tangjiashan Quake Lake in the case of emergency treatment. Bed erosion
and lateral development of the dam breach are represented through
accounting for the underlying physics including selective sediment
transport and gravitational collapse. Conceptualized breach erosion
model that involves few parameters enables quick calibration based on
the monitored hydrological data in emergency analysis where fully
geotechnical information about the barrier dam is not available. The
process of dam breach development is found to be nonlinear in cascades
due to the combined effects of headcutting and bank collapse. The
agreement between the simulation results and the observed data shows the
applicability of the present approach for emergency analysis of quake
lakes. Limitations will arise in the situation where the soil
composition of barrier dam is significantly inhomogeneous. Incorporation
of circular arc failure for cohesive soil and lateral seepage in bank
slope will also enhance its applicability to complex situations.

PD  - 
AB  - The influence of land use changes on flood occurrence and severity in
the Bisagno River (Thyrrenian Liguria, N.W. Italy is investigated using
a Monte Carlo simulation approach (Rulli and Rosso, 2002). High
resolution land-use maps for the area were reconstructed and scenario
simulations were made for a pre-industrial (1878), an intermediate
(1930) and a current (1980) year. Land-use effects were explored to
assess the consequences of distributed changes in land use due to
agricultural practice and urbanisation. Hydraulic conveyance effects
were considered, to assess the consequences of channel modifications
associated with engineering works in the lower Bisagno River network.
Flood frequency analyses of the annual flood series, retrieved from the
simulations, were used to examine the effect of land-use change and
river conveyance on flood regime. The impact of these effects proved to
be negligible in the upper Bisagno River, moderate in the downstream
river and severe in the small tributaries in the lower Bisagno valley
that drain densely populated urban areas. The simulation approach is
shown to be capable of incorporating historical data on landscape and
river patterns into quantitative methods for risk assessment.

Y1  - 2005///
PD  - 
AB  - The occurrence of calamitous meteoric events represents a current
problem of the Salento peninsula (Southern Italy). In fact, flash
floods, generated by very intense rainfall, occur not only in autumn and
winter, but at the end of summer as well. These calamities are amplified
by peculiar geological and geomorphological characteristics of Salento
and by the pollution of sinkholes. Floodings affect often large areas,
especially in the impermeable lowering zones. These events cause
warnings and emergency states, involving people as well as
socio-economic goods.
A methodical investigation based on the historic flood records and an
analysis of the geoenvironmental factors have been performed, using a
Geographic Information System (GIS) methodology for database processing
in order to identify the distribution of areas with different risk
degrees. The data, referring to events that occurred from 1968 to 2004,
have been collected in a database, the so-called IPHAS (Salento Alluvial
PHenomena Inventory), extracted in an easily consultable table. The
final goal is the development of a risk map where the areas that are
affected by floodings are included between small ridges, the so-called
``Serre{''}. More than 50% of the Salento peninsula shows high or very
high risk values. The numerous maps that were utilized and gencrated
represent an important basis in order to quantify the flood risk,
according to the model using historic records.

Y1  - 2009///
PD  - 
AB  - On the basis of the description of the 1997 Rivillas flood deposits, a
morphosedimentary feature classification is proposed. Mapping of the
main morphosedimentary deposits in seven reaches along the basin has
provided abundant data for each defined typology and for a better
adjustment of their stability fields. Because of their unstable
preservation environment, immediate post-flood field surveys with
descriptions of erosive and depositional features were undertaken. Up to
18 features were classified as either sedimentary or erosive and mapped
according to their genetic environments. Anthropic interference such as
land use changes produce modification of sediment supply and in channel
and floodplain erosive processes causing flash-floods to be more
catastrophic. Erosive features are dominant over sedimentary ones, as
the sedimentary budget in the river is negative. By means of HEC-RAS
(Hydrologic Engineering Center) modelling, we were able to obtain mean
values of the main variables limiting feature stability (velocity,
depth, stream powers and shear stress). These provide information
regarding maximum stability threshold and peak flood discharge. The
ephemeral nature of riverine flash-flood deposits in this type of
setting does not mean that they are not significant, and their
interpretation after recent floods can significantly improve
interpretation of the event dynamics and its flood hydrology and also be
useful for flood risk mapping. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights

AB  - This paper presents a coupled observation and modelling strategy aiming
at improving the understanding of processes triggering flash floods.
This strategy is illustrated for the Mediterranean area using two French
catchments (Gard and Ardeche) larger than 2000 km(2). The approach is
based on the monitoring of nested spatial scales: (1) the hills-lope
scale, where processes influencing the runoff generation and its
concentration can be tackled; (2) the small to medium catchment scale
(1-100 km(2)), where the impact of the network structure and of the
spatial variability of rainfall, landscape and initial soil moisture can
be quantified; (3) the larger scale (100-1000 km(2)), where the river
routing and flooding processes become important. These observations are
part of the HyMeX (HYdrological cycle in the Mediterranean EXperiment)
enhanced observation period (EOP), which will last 4 years (2012-2015).
In terms of hydrological modelling, the objective is to set up
regional-scale models, while addressing small and generally ungauged
catchments, which represent the scale of interest for flood risk
assessment. Top-down and bottom-up approaches are combined and the
models are used as ``hypothesis testing{''} tools by coupling model
development with data analyses in order to incrementally evaluate the
validity of model hypotheses. The paper first presents the rationale
behind the experimental set-up and the instrumentation itself. Second,
we discuss the associated modelling strategy. Results illustrate the
potential of the approach in advancing our understanding of flash flood
processes on various scales.

AB  - With the increase in frequency and severity of flash flood events in
major cities around the world, the infrastructure and people living in
those urban areas are exposed continuously to high risk levels of
pluvial flooding. The situation is likely to be exacerbated by the
potential impact of future climate change. A fast flood model could be
very useful for flood risk analysis. One-dimensional (1D) models provide
limited information about the flow dynamics whereas two-dimensional (2D)
models require substantial computational time and cost, a factor that
limits their use. This paper presents an alternative approach using
cellular automata (CA) for 2D modelling. The model uses regular grid
cells as a discrete space for the CA setup and applies generic rules to
local neighbourhood cells to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of
pluvial flooding. The proposed CA model is applied to a hypothetical
terrain and a real urban area. The synchronous state updating rule and
inherent nature of the proposed model contributes to a great reduction
in computational time. The results are compared with a hydraulic model
and good agreement is found between the two models.

AB  - One of the main problems of flood hazard assessment in ungauged or
poorly gauged basins is the lack of runoff data. In an attempt to
overcome this problem we have combined archival records,
dendrogeomorphic time series and instrumental data (daily rainfall and
discharge) from four ungauged and poorly gauged mountain basins in
Central Spain with the aim of reconstructing and compiling information
on 41 flash flood events since the end of the 19th century. Estimation
of historical discharge and the incorporation of uncertainty for the
at-site and regional flood frequency analysis were performed with an
empirical rainfall-runoff assessment as well as stochastic and Bayesian
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. Results for each of the
ungauged basins include flood frequency, severity, seasonality and
triggers (synoptic meteorological situations). The reconstructed data
series clearly demonstrates how uncertainty can be reduced by including
historical information, but also points to the considerable influence of
different approaches on quantile estimation. This uncertainty should be
taken into account when these data are used for flood risk management.

T1  - Deluge, disaster and development in Uttarakhand Himalayan region of India: Challenges and lessons for disaster management
A1  - Kala, Chandra Prakash
Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - The Himalaya has been venerated by communities since antiquity and hence
visited by a large number of pilgrims for paying tribute, annually.
Uttarakhand state in the Indian Himalaya being the place of major Hindu
shrines like Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri and also the
place of origin of many sacred rivers including the Ganges, at present,
is best known for the religious tourism. Though, the state population is
about 10 million, over 25 million tourists visited here in 2011 despite
the fact that the state remains under frequent natural hazards in the
forms of landslides, earthquakes and flash Roods mainly during monsoon.
Recently, on 16 and 17 June 2013, the torrential downpour and subsequent
flooding had wreaked havoc that not only swallowed vast swathes of
Uttarakhand but also took life of thousands of pilgrims and tourists.
The cloudburst, heavy rainfall and subsequent landslides are the natural
disasters but this disaster in Uttarakhand is mainly attributed by
masses as a man-made disaster due to unregulated tourism and unplanned
construction. In this background, the major aim of this study is to
explore and review the factors responsible for increased intensity and
scale of disaster due to flash floods in the Uttarakhand state of India.
The paper also reviews and discusses various options for disaster risk
reductions in the sensitive ecosystem such as the Himalaya. (C) 2014

A1  - Yang, Han-Chung

Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - A robust and reliable risk assessment procedure for hydrological hazards
deserves attention. The transport of mixed material in the types of
hazard, such as flash floods and debris flows, plays an important role
and should be taken into consideration. At present, however, the mixed
material transport phenomenon is not systematically and simply included
in the procedures for the elaboration of hazard analysis. The
consequence is the risk of losing prediction accuracy and of
underestimating hazard impacts. The phenomenon of open-channel junction
flow such as in irrigation ditches and at wastewater treatment
facilities is an important aspect of hydrological engineering. Extensive
experimental studies of the flow characteristics have been conducted. In
this study, an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter is used to monitor the flow
in large open-channel junctions at the Chihtan purification plant in
Taipei. The condition of the experiment is made up of different
discharge. The result of the measurement data shows that the mean
velocity profile, aspect ratio, measured vertical line location and the
ratio of the distance of the vertical line maximum velocity from the bed
to water depth. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used to simulate
the mean velocity profiles in this study. The results show that the ANN
can accurately and reliably simulate the mean velocity profiles. The
result is believed to provide hints for the consideration of the
effects, induced by mixed material transport, in the elaboration of
hazard analysis.

T1  - Flash Flood Hazard Mapping Using Satellite Images and GIS Tools: A case study of Najran City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)
A1  - Elkhrachy, Ismail
Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Flash flood in the cities led to high levels of water in the streets and
roads, causing many problems such as bridge collapse, building damage
and traffic problems. It is impossible to avoid risks of floods or
prevent their occurrence, however it is plausible to work on the
reduction of their effects and to reduce the losses which they may
cause. Flash flood mapping to identify sites in high risk flood zones is
one of the powerful tools for this purpose. Mapping flash flood will be
beneficial to urban and infrastructure planners, risk managers and
disaster response or emergency services during extreme and intense
rainfall events. The objective of this paper is to generate flash flood
map for Najran city, Saudi Arabia, using satellite images and GIS tools.
To do so, we use SPOT and SRTM DEMs data for which accuracy assessment
is achieved by using check points, obtained by GPS observations.
Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) is used to determine relative
impact weight of flood causative factors to get a composite flood hazard
index (FHI). The causative factors in this study are runoff, soil type,
surface slope, surface roughness, drainage density, distance to main
channel and land use. All used data are finally integrated in an ArcMap
to prepare a final flood hazard map for study area. The areas in high
risk flood zones are obtained by overlaying the flood hazard index map
with the zone boundaries layer. The affected population number and land
area are determined and compared. (C) 2015 Authority for Remote Sensing

AB  - The ongoing retreat of glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) is
associated with climate change. While deglaciation can cause a suite of
impacts, one of the most visible and tangible impacts is the formation
of glacial lakes. Some of these lakes can burst out causing large flash
floods with the potential to cause significant damage to property, lives
and livelihoods. At the moment, knowledge of the current glacial lake
outburst flood (GLOF) risk in the HKH is incomplete, and a proper risk
assessment is often circumvented. There is a need for a comprehensive
GLOF risk assessment in order to support proper planning of mitigation
and adaptation strategies in this context. In this paper we present a
methodological approach for the GLOF risk assessment. The major part of
the risk assessment is GLOF simulation and downstream impact assessment.
The methodology was applied to the Sun Koshi river basin, a
trans-boundary river basin between Tibet (China) and Nepal. A glacial
lake outburst hydrograph was simulated using a dambreak model. The
outburst flood was routed along the river using a hydrodynamic model to
estimate the potential impact areas. A field survey was conducted to
assess the potential damage caused by the GLOF. The peak outburst flood
could be in the order of 7900 m(3) s(-1). The analysis shows that about
950 ha of land and a large amount of infrastructure are exposed to the
GLOF. The economic risk due to the direct impact of a GLOF is estimated
to be about US$197 million.

PD  - 
AB  - Urban floods have adverse impacts on the performance of urban
infrastructures and the life of residents. The floods cause heavy
damages and perturbation in the serviceability of urban infrastructures
as well as transportation. Therefore, different factors affecting the
urban water flood characteristics should be considered in urban
development planning, especially in metropolitan areas. In recent years,
climate change and its consequences have affected the total components
of the water cycle as well as floods. These effects are intensified in
urban areas because of the anthropogenic effects they have on the water
cycle, such as reducing the infiltration capacity of basins,
construction regardless of the channel's right of way, and disposal of
sediment and solid wastes into channels that will decrease the channels'
safe carrying capacity. In this way, incorporating climate change impact
on urban water studies could help to achieve more reliable results to be
applied in real-time planning of urban areas through selection of best
management practices (BMPs). In this study, an algorithm for selecting
the BMPs to improve the system performance and reliability in dealing
with urban flash floods is proposed that considers the anthropogenic and
climate change effects. The suggested algorithm is applied to the Tehran
metropolitan area drainage system as a case study. First, the future
rainfall pattern of the study area under climate change impact is
simulated. Then, the effectiveness of present and future development
projects for improvement of drainage system performance is evaluated
under different scenarios. Also, the effect of solid wastes and
sediments carried with surface runoff in system performance is
considered. Finally, feasibility of suggested BMPs and their
effectiveness in urban flood management as well as their related costs
and benefits are considered. The results of the study show the
significance of using analytical and management tools in assessing and
improving the urban drainage system. DOI:

PD  - 
AB  - Spatial and temporal variability in extreme rainfall, and its
interactions with land cover and the drainage network, is an important
driver of flood response. ``Design storms,{''} which are commonly used
for flood risk assessment, however, are assumed to be uniform in space
and either uniform or highly idealized in time. The impacts of these and
other commonly-made assumptions are rarely considered, and their impacts
on flood risk estimates are poorly understood. This study presents an
alternate framework for rainfall frequency analysis that couples
stochastic storm transposition (SST) with ``storm catalogs{''} developed
from a ten-year high-resolution (15-min, 1-km(2)) radar rainfall dataset
for the region surrounding Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. The SST
procedure involves spatial and temporal resampling from these storm
catalogs to reconstruct the regional climatology of extreme rainfall.
SST-based intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) estimates are driven by the
spatial and temporal rainfall variability from weather radar
observations, are tailored specifically to the chosen watershed, and do
not require simplifying assumptions of storm structure. We are able to
use the SST procedure to reproduce IDE estimates from conventional
methods for four urban watersheds in Charlotte. We demonstrate that
extreme rainfall can vary substantially in time and in space, with
potentially important flood risk implications that cannot be assessed
using conventional techniques. SST coupled with high-resolution radar
rainfall fields represents a useful alternative to conventional design
storms for flood risk assessment, the full advantages of which can be
realized when the concept is extended to flood frequency analysis using
a distributed hydrologic model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Y1  - 2008///
PD  - 
AB  - In Mediterranean Europe, flash flooding is one of the most devastating
hazards in terms of loss of human life and infrastructures. Over the
last two decades, flash floods have caused damage costing a billion
Euros in France alone. One of the problems of flash floods is that
warning times are very short, leaving typically only a few hours for
civil protection services to act. This study investigates if
operationally available short-range numerical weather forecasts together
with a rainfall-runoff model can be used for early indication of the
occurrence of flash floods.
One of the challenges in flash flood forecasting is that the watersheds
are typically small, and good observational networks of both rainfall
and discharge are rare. Therefore, hydrological models are difficult to
calibrate and the simulated river discharges cannot always be compared
with ground measurements. The lack of observations in most flash flood
prone basins, therefore, necessitates the development of a method where
the excess of the simulated discharge above a critical threshold can
provide the forecaster with an indication of potential flood hazard in
the area, with lead times of the order of weather forecasts.
This study is focused on the Cevennes-Vivarais region in the Southeast
of the Massif Central in France, a region known for devastating flash
floods. This paper describes the main aspects of using numerical weather
forecasting for flash flood forecasting, together with a threshold -
exceedance. As a case study the severe flash flood event which took
place on 8 - 9 September 2002 has been chosen.
Short-range weather forecasts, from the Lokalmodell of the German
national weather service, are used as input for the LISFLOOD model, a
hybrid between a conceptual and physically based rainfall-runoff model.
Results of the study indicate that high resolution operational weather
forecasting combined with a rainfall-runoff model could be useful to
determine flash floods more than 24 h in advance.

AB  - We propose a new simplified vision of flood dynamics through temporal
and spatial scales to enhance understanding of potential and limits of
human responses to flash floods. Based on data from a set of extreme
flash floods that occurred in Europe, we analyze both the runoff
response time of flash floods and the asynchronous character of flood
peak time generation. We introduce the concept of ``timeliness{''} to
quantify the balance in time between the hydrological response of
catchments to heavy storms and the human reactions. Timeliness is
investigated across the range of spatial scales of concern for flash
floods and for various types of anticipation actions. Results are
reported for four extreme flash flood events occurred since 2002 in
France, Italy and Slovenia. These results indicate that human actions
adapt their pace to the physical context and are in a kind of
``hurrying{''} process as the flood danger approaches in time. They show
the importance of self-organization and `unofficial' warning in response
to flash flooding by individuals and groups. The work draws on flood
hazard research findings from hydrology, meteorology and social science
and put forward a framework for interdisciplinary collaboration between
hydrologists and social scientists. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

PD  - 
AB  - Accurate records of flash flood magnitudes are required to inform flood
forecasting and planning. However, whilst a distributed flood survey is
desirable to capture spatial heterogeneity in peak water surface
elevation, the field time required for a distributed survey often limits
the spatial coverage of such reconstructions. For the first time, we
demonstrate the application of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to reconstruct the magnitude of a flash flood.
This approach required only standard digital photographs and ground
control points, took only similar to 30 min in the field, and can be
embedded within existing protocols easily. We validated the method
against a conventional dGPS survey in three stages: (i) comparison of
topographic data revealed that SfM was accurate to within 0.1 m; (ii)
high water marks extracted from the SfM model were within 0.25 m of
those surveyed in the field with no consistent over or under-estimate;
(iii) peak discharge reconstructed from a two-dimensional hydraulic
model was within the range of more conventional estimates. With low
uncertainty in our terrain model and our reconstructed flood water
surface, we highlight the added value of the SfM approach for
incorporating reach scale spatial variability into hydraulic
reconstructions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PD  - 
AB  - Recent destructive flood events and projected increases in flood risks
as a result of climate change in many regions around the world
demonstrate the importance of improving flood risk management.
Flood-proofing of buildings is often advocated as an effective strategy
for limiting damage caused by floods. However, few empirical studies
have estimated the damage that can be avoided by implementing such flood
damage mitigation measures. This study estimates potential damage
savings and the cost-effectiveness of specific flood damage mitigation
measures that were implemented by households during major flood events
in France. For this purpose, data about flood damage experienced and
household flood preparedness were collected using a survey of 885 French
households in three flood-prone regions that face different flood
hazards. Four main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First,
using regression analysis results in improved estimates of the
effectiveness of mitigation measures than methods used by earlier
studies that compare mean damage suffered between households who have,
and who have not, taken these measures. Second, this study has provided
empirical insights showing that some mitigation measures can
substantially reduce damage during floods. Third, the effectiveness of
the mitigation measures is very regional dependent, which can be
explained by the different characteristics of the flood hazard in our
sample areas that experience either slow onset river flooding or more
rapid flash and coastal flooding. Fourth, the cost-efficiency of the
flood damage mitigation measures depends strongly on the flood
probability faced by households. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

number of minor river beds) are calculated. These measurements permit to
predict approximately the behavior of the basin in the presence of a

the weights-of-evidence (WofE) landslide susceptibility model in areas
that are very different in terms of size, geoenvironmental settings, and
landslide types. The second was to test the appropriate strategies to
sample the mapped landslide polygon. The final aim was to evaluate the
performance of the method to changes in the landslide sample size used
to train the model. The method was applied to two areas: the Fella River
basin (eastern Italian Alps) containing debris flows, and Buzau County
(Romanian Carpathians) with shallow landslides. The three landslide
sampling strategies used were: (1) the landslide scarp centroid, (2)
points populating the scarp on a 50-m grid, and (3) the entire scarp
polygon. The highest success rates were obtained when sampling shallow
landslides as 50-m grid-points and debris flow scarps as polygons.
Prediction rates were highest when using the entire scarp polygon method
for both landslide types. The sample size test using the landslide
centroids showed that a sample of 104 debris flow scarps was sufficient
to predict the remaining 941 debris flows in the Fella River basin,
while 161 shallow landslides was the minimum required number to predict
the remaining 1451 scarps in Buzau County. Below these landslide sample
thresholds, model performance was too low. However, using more
landslides than the threshold produced a plateau effect with little to
no increase in the model performance rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

AB  - The objective of this paper is to examine how Current techniques for
flash-flood monitoring and forecasting can meet the needs of the
Population at risk to evaluate the flood severity and anticipate its
danger. To this end, the social response time for different social
actions in the course of two well studied flash flood events which
Occurred ill France and Italy is identified. The event management
activities are broadly characterized into three types according to their
main objective (information, organisation and protection). The
activities are also classified into three other types according, to the
scale and nature of the human group involved (individuals, communities
and institutions). The conclusions reached relate to (1) the
characterisation of the social responses according to watershed scale
and to the information available, and (2) to the appropriateness of the
existing surveillance and forecasting tools to Support the social
responses. Results suggest that representing the dynamics of the social
response with just one number representing the average time for warning
a population is an oversimplification. It appears that the social
response time exhibits a parallel with the hydrological response time by
diminishing in time with decreasing size of the relevant watershed. A
second result is that the human groups have different capabilities of
anticipation, apparently based oil the nature of information they use.
Comparing watershed response times and social response times shows
clearly that at scales of less than 100 km(2), a number of actions were
taken with response times comparable to the catchment response time. The
implications for adapting the warning processes to social scales
(individual or organisational scales) are considerable. At small scales,
and for the implied anticipation times. the reliable and high-resolution
description of the actual rainfall field becomes the major Source of
information for decision-making processes Such as deciding between
evacuations or advising to stay home. This points to the need to improve
the accuracy and quality control of real time radar rainfall data,
especially for extreme flash flood-generating storms. Copyright (C) 2009

Y1  - 2014///
PD  - 
AB  - Flooding is the product of complex interactions among spatially and
temporally varying rainfall, heterogeneous land surface properties, and
drainage network structure. Conventional approaches to flood frequency
analysis rely on assumptions regarding these interactions across a range
of scales. The impacts of these assumptions on flood risk estimates are
poorly understood. In this study, we present an alternative flood
frequency analysis framework based on stochastic storm transposition
(SST). We use SST to synthesize long records of rainfall over the
Charlotte, North Carolina, USA metropolitan area by reshuffling radar
rainfall fields, within a probabilistic framework, from a 10 year
(2001-2010) high-resolution (15 min, 1 km(2)) radar data set. We use
these resampled fields to drive a physics-based distributed hydrologic
model for a heavily urbanized watershed in Charlotte. The approach makes
it possible to estimate discharge return periods for all points along
the drainage network without the assumptions regarding rainfall
structure and its interactions with watershed features that are required
using conventional methods. We develop discharge estimates for return
periods from 10 to 1000 years for a range of watershed scales up to 110
km(2). SST reveals that flood risk in the larger subwatersheds is
dominated by tropical storms, while organized thunderstorm systems
dominate flood risk in the smaller subwatersheds. We contrast these
analyses with examples of potential problems that can arise from
conventional frequency analysis approaches. SST provides an approach for
examining the spatial extent of flooding and for incorporating
nonstationarities in rainfall or land use into flood risk estimates.

evaluation of damage produced by a flood. A model has been developed for
flood damage estimation based on a geographic information system (GIS).
It could be used by land administration bodies and insurance companies
to manage flood-related damage data. The model simulates flood scenarios
and evaluates expected economic losses from the impact of floodwaters on
exposed elements, through the application of a computational model
elaborated by GIS. During the development of the model, the Boesio
Stream, a small watercourse flowing into Lake Maggiore (Lombardy,
northern Italy) which was recently affected by a flash flood, was used
as case study to test and calibrate the methodology. The method could be
used either as a forecasting tool to define event scenarios, utilizing
data from events simulated with a hydraulic model, or for real-time
damage assessment after a disaster. The approach is suitable to
large-area damage assessment and could be appropriate for land use
planning, civil protection and risk mitigation.

AB  - Urban pluvial flood are attracting growing public concern due to rising
intense precipitation and increasing consequences. Accurate risk
assessment is critical to an efficient urban pluvial flood management,
particularly in transportation sector. This paper describes an
integrated methodology, which initially makes use of high resolution 2D
inundation modeling and flood depth-dependent measure to evaluate the
potential impact and risk of pluvial flash flood on road network in the
city center of Shanghai, China. Intensity-Duration-Frequency
relationships of Shanghai rainstorm and Chicago Design Storm are
combined to generate ensemble rainfall scenarios. A hydrodynamic model
(FloodMap-HydroInundation2D) is used to simulate overland flow and flood
inundation for each scenario. Furthermore, road impact and risk
assessment are respectively conducted by a new proposed algorithm and
proxy. Results suggest that the flood response is a function of
spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation and local characteristics
(i.e. drainage and topography), and pluvial flash flood is found to lead
to proportionate but nonlinear impact on intra-urban road inundation
risk. The approach tested here would provide more detailed flood
information for smart management of urban street network and may be
applied to other big cities where road flood risk is evolving in the
context of climate change and urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

PD  - 
AB  - Flash flooding often leads to extremely dangerous and sometimes
catastrophic conditions in rivers due to characteristics such as: short
timescales, the limited opportunity for issuing warnings, and the
frequent high average mortality. Many past extreme flood events have
been accompanied by flash floods, and they have also been one of the
main sources of serious loss of human life among the world's worst
natural disasters. Flash floods can also cause large loss of property,
such as the recent floods in Pakistan and the damage to vehicles in the
2004 Boscastle flood in the UK. It is therefore desirable to be able to
assess the degree of safety of people and vehicles during flash floods
using numerical models. In the current study, an algorithm for assessing
the flood hazard risk to people and vehicles has been integrated into an
existing two-dimensional hydrodynamic model capable of simulating flash
floods. In the algorithm, empirical curves relating water depths and
corresponding critical velocities for children and adults, developed by
previous researchers, are used to assess the degree of people safety,
and a new incipient velocity formula is used to evaluate the degree of
vehicle safety. The developed model was then applied to three real case
studies, including: the Glasgow and Boscastle floods in the UK, and the
Malpasset dam-failure flood in France. According to the analysis of
model predictions, the following conclusions have been obtained: (i)
simulated results for the Glasgow flood showed that children would be in
danger of standing in the flooded streets in a small urban area; (ii)
simulations for the Boscastle flood indicated that vehicles in the car
park would be flushed away by the flow with high velocity, which
indirectly testified the predictive accuracy of the incipient formula
for vehicles; and (iii) simulations for the Malpasset dam-failure flood
showed that the adopted method for the assessment of people safety was
applicable, and some local people living below the dam would have been
swept away, which corresponded well with the report of casualties.
Therefore, the developed integrated model can be used to evaluate the
flood hazard risk to people and vehicles in flash floods, and these
predictions can be used in flood risk management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A robust and reliable risk assessment procedure for hydrologic hazards
deserves particular attention to the role of transported woody material
during flash floods or debris flows. At present, woody material
transport phenomena are not systematically considered within the
procedures for the elaboration of hazard maps. The consequence is a risk
of losing prediction accuracy and of underestimating hazard impacts.
Transported woody material frequently interferes with the sediment
regulation capacity of open check dams and moreover, when obstruction
phenomena at critical cross-sections of the stream occur, inundations
can be triggered. The paper presents a procedure for the determination
of the relative propensity of mountain streams to the entrainment and
delivery of recruited woody material on the basis of empirical
indicators. The procedure provided the basis for the elaboration of a
hazard index map for all torrent catchments of the Autonomous Province
of Bolzano/Bozen. The plausibility of the results has been thoroughly
checked by a backward oriented analysis on natural hazard events,
documented since 1998 at the Department of Hydraulic Engineering of the
aforementioned Alpine Province. The procedure provides hints for the
consideration of the effects, induced by woody material transport,
during the elaboration of hazard zone maps.

T1  - Flash flood warning in ungauged basins by use of the flash flood guidance and model-based runoff thresholds

Y1  - 2009///
PD  - 
AB  - This paper investigates the use of the Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) method
and a method of model-based threshold runoff computation to improve the
accuracy of flash flood forecasts at ungauged locations. The methodology
proposed in this paper requires running a lumped hydrological model to
derive flood frequencies at the outlet of the ungauged basin under
consideration, and then to derive the threshold runoff from these
model-based discharges. The Study examines the potential of this method
to account for the hydrological model's Uncertainty and for biases
originated by lack of model calibration. which is the typical condition
in ungauged basins.
Experiments to validate this approach involve the implementation of a
semi-distributed Continuous rainfall-runoff model and the operation of
the FFG method over four basins located in the central-eastern Italian
Alps and ranging in size from 75.2 to 213.7 km(2). The model is
calibrated on two larger basins and the model parameters are transposed
to the other two basins to Simulate operations in ungauged basins. The
FFG method is applied by using the 2 year discharge as the threshold
runoff. The threshold runoff is derived both by using local discharge
statistics and the model-based approach advocated here. Examination of
the results obtained by this comparison shows that the use of
model-based threshold leads to improvements in both gauged and ungauged
situations. Overall, the Critical Success Index (CSI) increases by 12%
for gauged basins and by 31% for ungauged basins by using the
model-based threshold with respect to use of local data. As expected,
the increase of CSI is more remarkable for ungauged basins, due to lack
of local model calibration and the greater likelihood of occurrence of a
Simulation bias in model application over these basins. This shows that
the method of threshold runoff computation provides an inherent bias
correction to reduce systematic errors in model applications to ungauged
(and gauged) basins. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological Society

AB  - Quantifying uncertainty in flood forecasting is a difficult task, given
the multiple and strongly nonlinear model components involved in such a
system. Much effort has been and is being invested in the quest of
dealing with uncertain precipitation observations and forecasts and the
propagation of such uncertainties through hydrological and hydraulic
models predicting river discharges and risk for inundation. The COST 731
Action is one of these and constitutes a European initiative which deals
with the quantification of forecast uncertainty in hydro-meteorological
forecast systems. COST 731 addresses three major lines of development:
(1) combining meteorological and hydrological models to form a forecast
chain, (2) propagating uncertainty information through this chain and
make it available to end users in a suitable form, (3) advancing
high-resolution numerical weather prediction precipitation forecasts by
using non-conventional observations from, for instance, radar to
determine details in the initial conditions on scales smaller than what
can be resolved by conventional observing systems. Recognizing the
interdisciplinarity of the challenge COST 731 has organized its work
forming Working Groups at the interfaces between the different
scientific disciplines involved, i.e. between observation and
atmospheric (and hydrological) modelling (WG-1), between atmospheric and
hydrologic modelling (WG-2) and between hydrologic modelling and
end-users (WG-3).
This paper summarizes the COST 731 activities and its context, provides
a review of the recent progress made in dealing with uncertainties in
flood forecasting, and sets the scene for the papers of this Thematic
Issue. In particular, a bibliometric analysis highlights the strong
recent increase in addressing the uncertainty analysis in flood
forecasting from an integrated perspective. Such a perspective
necessarily involves the area of meteorology, hydrology, and decision
making in order to take operational advantage of the scientific
progress, an aspect in which COST 731 is successfully contributing to
furthering the flood damage mitigation capabilities in Europe. (C) 2010

AB  - This paper reports on the numerical modelling of flash flood propagation
in urban areas after an excessive rainfall event or dam/dyke break wave.
A two-dimensional (2-D) depth-averaged shallow-water model is used, with
a refined grid of quadrilaterals and triangles for representing the
urban area topography. The 2-D shallow-water equations are solved using
the explicit second-order scheme that is adapted from MUSCL approach.
Four applications are described to demonstrate the potential benefits
and limits of 2-D modelling: (i) laboratory experimental dam-break wave
in the presence of an isolated building; (ii) flash flood over a
physical model of the urbanized Toce river valley in Italy; (iii) flash
flood in October 1988 at the city of NImes (France) and (iv) dam-break
flood in October 1982 at the town of Sumacarcel (Spain). Computed flow
depths and velocities compare well with recorded data, although for the
experimental study on dam-break wave some discrepancies are observed
around buildings, where the flow is strongly 3-D in character. The
numerical simulations show that the flow depths and flood wave celerity
are significantly affected by the presence of buildings in comparison
with the original floodplain. Further, this study confirms the
importance of topography and roughness coefficient for flood propagation
simulation.

T1  - Flash flood awareness in southwest Virginia

PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods are one of the most dangerous weather-related natural
disasters in the world. These events develop less than six hours after a
rainfall event and create hazardous situations for people and extensive
damage to property. It is critical for flash flood conditions to be
warned of in a timely manner to minimize impacts. There is currently a
knowledge gap between flood experts and the general public about the
level of perceived risk that the latter has toward the powerful flood
waters and how events should be warned of, which affects the
communication capabilities and efficiency of the warning process. Prior
research has addressed risk perception of natural disasters, but there
is little emphasis on flash floods within flood-prone regions of the
United States. This research utilizes an online survey of 300
respondents to determine the current state of flash flood awareness and
preparation in southwest Virginia. Analysis of trends involved the use
of chi-squared tests (chi(2)) and simple frequency and percentage
calculations. Results reveal that a knowledge base of flash floods does
exist, but is not advanced enough for proper awareness. Young adults
have a lower understanding and are not as concerned about flood impacts.
Increased exposure and perceived risk play a key role in shaping the way
a person approaches flash floods. People do monitor flood events, but
they are unaware of essential guidance and communication mechanisms.
Finally, results suggest that the current method of warning about flash
floods is not provided at an appropriate level of detail for effective
communication.

communities of the Bavarian Alps using the mental model approach.
Thirty-eight qualitative interviews, two telephone surveys with 600
respondents, and two onsite interviews (74/95 respondents) were
conducted. Mental models concerning flash floods are much better
developed than those for landslides because the key physical processes
for flash floods are easier for the general public to recognize and
understand. Mental models are influenced by the local conditions. People
who have a better knowledge about the hazards are those who use many
different sources to inform themselves, express fear about natural
hazards, or have previous experience with hazards. Conclusions for how
to improve information for the general public are discussed.

AB  - There is still wide uncertainty about past flash-flood processes in
mountain regions owing to the lack of systematic databases on former
events. This paper presents a methodology to reconstruct peak discharge
of flash floods and illustrates a case in an ungauged catchment in the
Spanish Central System. The use of dendrogeomorphic evidence (i.e. scars
on trees) together with the combined use of a two-dimensional (2D)
numerical hydraulic model and a terrestrial laser scan (TLS) has allowed
estimation of peak discharge of a recent flash flood. The size and
height distribution of scars observed in the field have been used to
define three hypothetical scenarios (S-min or minimum scenario; S-med or
medium scenario; and S-max or maximum scenario), thus illustrating the
uncertainty involved in peak-discharge estimation of flash floods in
ungauged torrents.
All scars analysed with dendrogeomorphic techniques stem from a large
flash flood which took place on 17 December 1997. On the basis of the
scenarios, peak discharge is estimated to 79 +/- 14 m(3) s(-1). The
average deviation obtained between flood stage and expected scar height
was -0.09 +/- 0.53 m. From the data, it becomes obvious that the
geomorphic position of trees is the main factor controlling deviation
rate. In this sense, scars with minimum deviation were located on trees
growing in exposed locations, especially on unruffled bedrock where the
model predicts higher specific kinetic energy. The approach used in this
study demonstrates the potential of tree-ring analysis in
palaeohydrology and for flood-risk assessment in catchments with
vulnerable goods and infrastructure. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley &

A1  - Fowler, H J

Y1  - 2010///
PD  - 
AB  - There is growing evidence of coherent, global patterns of change in
annual precipitation and runoff with high latitudes experiencing
increases consistent with climate model projections. This paper
describes a methodology for estimating detection times for changes in
seasonal precipitation extremes. The approach is illustrated using
changes in UK precipitation projected by the European Union PRUDENCE
climate model ensemble. We show that because of high variability from
year to year and confounding factors, detection of anthropogenic climate
change at regional scales is not generally expected for decades to come.
Overall, the earliest detection times were found for 10 day winter
precipitation totals with 10 year return period in SW England. In this
case, formal detection could be possible within a decade from now if the
climate model projections are realized. The outlook for changes in
summer flash flood risk is highly uncertain. Our analysis further
demonstrates that existing precautionary allowances for climate change
used for flood management may not be sufficiently robust in NE England
and east Scotland. These findings imply that for certain types of flood
mechanism, adaptation decisions might have to be taken in advance of
formally detected changes in flood risk. This reinforces the case for
long-term environmental monitoring and reporting of climate change
indices at ``sentinel{''} locations.

PD  - 
AB  - Forecasting and monitoring of rainfall values are increasingly important
for decreasing economic loss caused by flash floods. Based on
statistical learning theory, support vector regression (SVR) has been
used to deal with forecasting problems. Performing structural risk
minimization rather than minimizing the training errors, SVR algorithms
have better generalization ability than the conventional artificial
neural networks. The objective of this investigation is to examine the
feasibility and applicability of SVR in forecasting volumes of rainfall
during typhoon seasons. In addition, Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms
are employed to choose parameters of the SVR model. Subsequently,
rainfall values during typhoon periods in Taiwan's Wu-Tu watershed are
used to demonstrate the forecasting performance of the proposed model.
The simulation results show that the proposed SVRSA model is a promising
alternative in forecasting amounts of rainfall during typhoon seasons.

AB  - On the 4 November 2011 a flash flood event hit the area of Genoa with
dramatic consequences. Such an event represents, from the meteorological
and hydrological perspective, a paradigm of flash floods in the
Mediterranean environment.
The hydro-meteorological probabilistic forecasting system for small and
medium size catchments in use at the Civil Protection Centre of Liguria
region exhibited excellent performances for the event, by predicting,
24-48 h in advance, the potential level of risk associated with the
forecast. It greatly helped the decision makers in issuing a timely and
correct alert.
In this work we present the operational outputs of the system provided
during the Liguria events and the post event hydrological modelling
analysis that has been carried out accounting also for the crowd
sourcing information and data. We discuss the benefit of the implemented
probabilistic systems for decision-making under uncertainty,
highlighting how, in this case, the multi-catchment approach used for
predicting floods in small basins has been crucial.

PD  - 
AB  - The aim of this work is to define reliable susceptibility models for
shallow landslides using Logistic Regression and Random Forests
multivariate statistical techniques. The study area, located in
North-East Sicily, was hit on October 1st 2009 by a severe rainstorm
(225 mm of cumulative rainfall in 7 h) which caused flash floods and
more than 1000 landslides. Several small villages, such as Giampilieri,
were hit with 31 fatalities, 6 missing persons and damage to buildings
and transportation infrastructures. Landslides, mainly types such as
earth and debris translational slides evolving into debris flows, were
triggered on steep slopes and involved colluvium and regolith materials
which cover the underlying metamorphic bedrock. The work has been
carried out with the following steps; i) realization of a detailed event
landslide inventory map through field surveys coupled with observation
of high resolution aerial colour orthophoto; ii) identification of
landslide source areas; iii) data preparation of landslide controlling
factors and descriptive statistics based on a bivariate method
(Frequency Ratio) to get an initial overview on existing relationships
between causative factors and shallow landslide source areas; iv) choice
of criteria for the selection and sizing of the mapping unit; v)
implementation of 5 multivariate statistical susceptibility models based
on Logistic Regression and Random Forests techniques and focused on
landslide source areas; vi) evaluation of the influence of sample size
and type of sampling on results and performance of the models; vii)
evaluation of the predictive capabilities of the models using ROC curve,
AUC and contingency tables; viii) comparison of model results and
obtained susceptibility maps; and ix) analysis of temporal variation of
landslide susceptibility related to input parameter changes. Models
based on Logistic Regression and Random Forests have demonstrated
excellent predictive capabilities. Land use and wildfire variables were
found to have a strong control on the occurrence of very rapid shallow
landslides. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the occurrence and to assess the determinants of
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in flood victims.
Method: We carried out a retrospective study to examine the occurrence
and the determinants of PTSD in victims of flood in 1998 and 1999 in
Hunan, China. We used multistage sampling to select the subjects from
the flood areas, and we ascertained PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria.
Data were collected in face-to-face interviews carried out by
experienced research assistants using a preconstructed questionnaire. We
used a multiple logistic regression model to analyze the data.
Results: A total of 33 340 subjects (86.0% of the selected subjects,
aged 7 years or over) in the study villages were interviewed. Among
them, 2875 (8.6%) had symptoms that met the diagnostic criteria for
PTSD. Significant risk factors for PTSD included female sex (odds ratio
{[}OR] 1.12; 95% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.04 to 1.21), older age
(age 18 to 59 years OR 2.28; 95%CI, 2.02 to 2.57, and age >= 60 years
OR 2.42; 95%CI, 2.05 to 2.85), flood type (collapsed embankment OR
1.84; 95%CI, 1.64 to 2.05, and flash flood OR 3.12; 95%CI, 2.76 to
3.52), and flood severity (intermediate OR 4.05; 95%CI, 3.55 to 4.62,
and severe OR 2.98; 95%CI, 2.60 to 3.41).
Conclusions: PTSD is a common mental disorder in flood victims, which
implies the need for improved health services, especially mental health
services, for this population.

Y1  - 2011///
PD  - 
AB  - Numerous reports of ``flash floods{''}, ``mud torrents{''} and
``landslides{''} in burnt landscapes of south-east Australia were only
recently linked to debris flows and recognised as a significant process
that warrant more detailed investigation. This paper provides a
systematic documentation of high-magnitude erosion events after wildfire
in south-east Australia, focusing on small (<5 km(2)), upland catchments
in eastern Victoria that were burnt by wildfire between 2003 and 2009.
The aims of the study were to i) collect and show evidence of debris
flow occurrence after wildfire; ii) quantify erosion rates from debris
flows and; iii) identify rainfall thresholds and key hydrological
properties. The result showed that 13 out of the 16 recorded
high-magnitude erosion events were runoff generated debris flows. These
occurred in dry eucalypt forests burnt at high or very high severity in
steep headwater catchments throughout the eastern uplands of Victoria.
The debris flows were triggered by intense, short duration rainfall
events (I-30 35-59 mm h(-1)) with annual exceedance probability in the
order of 20%. This is the first paper to document the occurrence of
post-fire runoff generated debris flows in Australia, so the discussion
draws on literature from the western USA, where a large body of research
has been dedicated to evaluating the risk posed by post-fire debris
flows and their role in landscape processes. Typical features common to
both systems include low infiltration capacity of burnt catchments;
widespread sheet erosion and levee lined rills on steep upper
hillslopes; and severe channel erosion initiated in response to
convergent flow in previously un-scoured drainage lines. The depth of
sheet erosion on surveyed slopes in the upper catchments (4.6 +/- 0.96
mm to 18.4 +/- 2.7 mm) indicates that hillslope material provides an
important source of sediment. The average channel entrainment rate of
three debris flows ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 m(3) m(-1). Runoff generated
debris flows were not recorded in wet or damp forest types suggesting
that this process is unlikely to operate in these forest environments.
One isolated case of mass failure generated debris flow was recorded in
wet forest. The outcome of the study indicates that runoff generated
debris flows in dry eucalypt forest are an important process to be
considered during post-fire risk assessment of hydrological hazards.

AB  - Semiarid flash floods pose a significant danger for life and property in
many dry regions around the world. One effective way to mitigate flood
risk lies in implementing a real-time forecast and warning system based
on a rainfall-runoff model. This study used a semiarid, physics-based,
and spatially distributed watershed model driven by high-resolution
radar rainfall input to evaluate such a system. The predictive utility
of the model and dominant sources of uncertainty were investigated for
several runoff events within the U. S. Department of Agriculture
Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed
located in the southwestern United States. Sources of uncertainty
considered were rainfall estimates, watershed model parameters, and
initial soil moisture conditions. Results derived through a
variance-based comprehensive global sensitivity analysis indicated that
the high predictive uncertainty in the modeled response was heavily
dominated by biases in the radar rainfall depth estimates. Key model
parameters and initial model states were identified, and we generally
found that modeled hillslope characteristics are more influential than
channel characteristics in small semiarid basins. We also observed an
inconsistency in the parameter sets identified as behavioral for
different events, which suggests that model calibration to historical
data is unlikely to consistently improve predictive performance for
different events and that real-time parameter updating may be
preferable.

become the basis of several flood-related warning systems, enabling the
detection of hazardous events with sufficient lead-time to prepare
effective emergency and response plans. The objective of this paper is
to review current European operational warning systems for water-related
hazards induced by severe weather conditions. In details, it includes
systems for detecting surface water flooding, flash floods, debris
flows, mud flows, rainfall-induced landslides, river floods and coastal
floods. Technical features and capabilities of different systems are
described, together with some noteworthy examples. The main strengths of
each system type are highlighted and suggestions are provided for
developing and further improving their overall skills in hazard
detection and the mutual coordination. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods are a common, but poorly understood feature of and
environments. Much of the uncertainty associated with flash flooding
events is associated with a lack of accurate environmental data. In
addition to limiting the understanding of hydrological processes, this
situation handicaps human use and development in such regions,
necessitating the use of modelling approaches for environmental
prediction. Here, a hydrological model driven mainly by information on
land cover distribution (derived by satellite remote sensing) and soil
properties (derived from field measurement) was used to predict sites at
risk from large peak flows associated with flash flooding in a wadi
located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. The land cover map was derived
from a maximum likelihood classification of a Landsat TM image and had
an estimated accuracy of 89.5%. The soils of the classes depicted in
this map differed markedly in terms of texture and permeability, with
the field based estimates of infiltration capacity ranging from 0.07 cm
h(-1) for desert pavement through 14.01 cm h (-1) for unconsolidated
wadi bed deposits. Using the derived information within the hydrological
modelling system, the discharge from the wadi and its sub-basins was
predicted for an assumed severe storm scenario. The outputs of the model
indicated two locations within the wadi where a very large peak
discharge (> 115 m(3) s(-1)) could be expected. These sites corresponded
to those that suffered flood damage in a recent storm event. The results
indicate the potential to drive an integrated hydrological model from
limited data to derive important and useful hydrological information in
a region where data are scarce. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

T1  - The missing link between flood risk awareness and preparedness: findings from case studies in an Alpine Region

Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - The low risk awareness of the residents living in flood-prone areas is
usually considered among the main causes of their low preparedness,
which in turns generates inadequate response to natural disasters. In
this paper, we challenge this assumption by reporting on the results of
a sociological research in four communities exposed to flood risk in the
Eastern Italian Alps. The research design included semi-structured
interviews and focus groups with key local stakeholders and a
standardized questionnaire submitted to 400 residents. Results revealed
that residents felt both slightly worried about flood risk and slightly
prepared to face an event. Considerable differences were found between
the evaluations of individual subjects as opposed to overall
communities. There was also a clear discrepancy between the actual
adoption of household preparatory measures and the willingness to take
self-protection actions. Overall, the risk awareness was significantly
higher among those residents who had been personally affected by a flood
in the past, were living in isolated (vs. urban) communities, in the
most risky areas or had a lower level of trust in local authorities. The
improvement of residents' knowledge about their environment and the
residual risk seemed to be crucial to increase risk awareness, and the
same was true for the strengthening of local support networks to foster
preparedness. The link between risk awareness and preparedness was not
at all straightforward. Results revealed instead the complexity of
residents' perspectives, attitudes, behaviours and decisions about
risk-related issues.

T1  - Quantitative precipitation forecasting in the UK
A1  - Golding, B W
Y1  - 2000///
PD  - 
AB  - The goal of realistic precipitation forecasts has been a major driver of
improvements to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). Increased computer
power has enabled dramatic improvements in resolution, data assimilation
and cloud physics amongst others. However, the impact of precipitation
on all aspects of life is such that the results still fall short of what
is required. In this paper I outline some of the main requirements for
precipitation forecasts in the UK, identify the critical areas where NWP
products fall short, and illustrate techniques being developed to
address them.
For very short lead times, high spatial and temporal resolution is
required, especially for prediction of flash floods. To meet this need,
the Met. Office's Nimrod system generates nowcasts by integrating radar,
satellite and rain gauge data with NWP products.
At lead times of a day or so, requirements range from very light
precipitation, especially in freezing conditions, to widespread frontal
rain and thunderstorms. The mesoscale version of the Met. Office's
Unified NWP Model provides skilful forecasts of frontal precipitation
structure and orographic influence at this range. However, an enhanced
diagnosis technique provides additional information on convective storm
probability.
In the medium range, the focus is on risk reduction, via early warnings
of adverse weather. Deterministic NWP forecasts are not reliable enough
and a probabilistic approach is required. This is being addressed
through processing of products from the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction
System. Work is underway to interface these products to an automated
warnings generator within the Met. Office's Horace forecaster support
system.
Together, these developments are meeting many of the demands for
precipitation forecasts that are currently unachievable with NWP models.

AB  - Flood protection is a society-wide task. The basic rules of prevention
in flood protection are stipulated by the regulation of a secondary
right of the European Union-Directive of the European Parliament and
Council 2007/60/EC on assessment and management of flood risks. The
paper is focused on preliminary flood risk assessment of flash floods.
The task was to obtain knowledge on the spatial variability of flood
risk from flash floods and in doing so supplement a preliminary flood
risk assessment already conducted in 2011 for the purpose of proposing
suitable flood mitigation measures for reducing the risk found. Flood
risk in this study is understood as a combination of flood hazard and
vulnerability. The main part of the work is devoted to the proposal of a
methodological approach for preliminary flood risk assessment of flash
floods. Application of the proposed approach in Bodva river basin,
southern Slovakia, is described in the results section.

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - This study aims at enabling the compilation of key lessons for decision
makers and urban planners in rapidly urbanizing cities regarding the
identification of representative, chief causal natural and human factors
for the increased level of flash flood risk. To achieve this, the
impacts of flash flood events of 2013 and 2014 in the capital of Sudan,
Khartoum, were assessed using seven integrated approaches, i.e. rainfall
data analysis, document analysis of affected people and houses,
observational fieldwork in the worst flood affected areas, people's
perception of causes and mitigation measures through household
interviews, reported drinking water quality, reported water-related
diseases and social risk assessment. Several lessons have been developed
as follows. Urban planners must recognize the devastating risks of
building within natural pathways of ephemeral watercourses. They must
also ensure effective drainage infrastructures and physio-geographical
investigations prior to developing urban areas. The existing urban
drainage systems become ineffective due to blockage by urban waste.
Building of unauthorized drainage and embankment structures by locals
often cause greater flood problems than normal. The urban runoff is
especially problematic for residential areas built within low-lying
areas having naturally low infiltration capacity, as surface water can
rapidly collect within hollows and depressions, or beside elevated roads
that preclude the free flow of floodwater. Weak housing and
infrastructure quality are especially vulnerable to flash flooding and
even to rainfall directly. Establishment of services infrastructure is
imperative for flash flood disaster risk reduction. Water supply should
be from lower aquifers to avoid contaminant ground water. Regular
monitoring of water quality and archiving of its indicators help
identify water-related diseases and sources of water contamination in
the event of environmental disasters such as floods. Though the
understanding of risk perception by the locals is an important aspect of
the decision making and planning processes, it should be advanced enough
for proper awareness. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Mediterranean region, floods are causing extended damages to the
population and infrastructures. In Morocco, only a few studies have been
conducted to understand flood processes while the vulnerability to
floods is high. The goals of this study are to compare two modeling
approaches for floods using either lumped or spatial rainfall and also
to evaluate hydrological forecast capabilities. The Rheraya research
catchment is characterized with steep slopes, altitudes ranging from
1027 to 4167 m, and a strong variability of rainfall. The lumped and
distributed models provided similar results and reproduced well a sample
of six flood events recorded in 2014. However, the distributed model
provided the best estimation of the initial conditions, estimated from
the ESA-CCI satellite soil moisture product and the Antecedent
Precipitation Index. The validation of the lumped and the distributed
models, using ESA-CCI to initialize the models, provides a Nash
coefficient of 0.61 and 0.63 respectively. Then, two meteorological
forecasts provided by the AROME and ALADIN models were evaluated against
observed precipitation to provide a hydrological forecast. The AROME
forecast performed better but still with a strong bias compared to
observed precipitation. Further research is needed to link quantitative
precipitation forecasts with hydrological models in this type of
catchment.

T1  - Geographical analysis of damage due to flash floods in southern France: The cases of 12-13 November 1999 and 8-9 September 2002
A1  - Vinet, Freddy
Y1  - 2008///
PD  - 
AB  - The southern part of France near the Mediterranean Sea is subject to
flash floods generated by heavy rainfalls typical of the Mediterranean
climate. In November 1999 (the 12th and 13th) and in September 2002 (the
8th and 9th), 5000 kin 2 were touched by rainfalls superior to 200mm in
the departments of Aude and Gard. In both cases, maximum precipitation
exceeded 500 min within 24 h. The damage amounted in the hundreds of
millions of euros, and there were numerous fatalities: 35 in 1999, and
23 in 2002. Following a survey of available data, this article details
the cost of the damage for both flash flood events. The distribution of
the damage is quantified by sector of activity (e.g., industry,
agriculture). The average ratio ``euros of loss per inhabitant{''} is
quite similar in both cases, but this average hides some geographical
discrepancies. Losses in industry can locally worsen the overall toll.
The mapping of damage on a local scale and the amount of losses per
inhabitant demonstrate that rural areas underwent heavy losses. This was
mostly due to the destruction of the public infrastructures (e.g.,
roads, bridges) that represented more than half of the overall loss. In
some rural areas, the cost of flash floods can exceed 15,000 euros per
inhabitant. Such flood prevention issues as flood warning systems and
land use planning must not focus only on the cities. Death, injury and
heavy material losses also disadvantage the rural and mountainous areas
where populations and activities are concentrated near rivers. (C) 2008

PD  - 
AB  - There is observational evidence that hydrometeorological extremes, such
as heavy rainfall events, have become more frequent and intense in the
last decades around the world. In Brazil, intense rainfall events that
triggered flash floods and landslides were responsible for 74% of the
deaths related to natural disasters in the 1991-2010 period. To evaluate
Brazil's hot spots of vulnerability to these disasters, two indices were
developed using three data sets: (1) climate, with IPCC climate extreme
indices; (2) environmental, including land use, drainage systems,
relief, slope, road density and hydrography; and (3) socioeconomic,
including the Gini coefficient, Human Development Index, housing
conditions and a poverty-related index. Simulations at high resolution
were carried out using the Eta 20-km regional climate model nested
within two global climate models: HadGEM2 ES and MIROC 5 IPCC AR5
models. For the baseline period of 1961-1990, the vulnerability indices
were adjusted by means of an iterative process and were validated by
comparing them to the Brazilian National Disasters Data. The two indices
were also used to estimate the vulnerability up to the end of the
twenty-first century, using the representative concentration pathways
(RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 from the IPCC AR5 RCP scenarios. The results indicate
a large increase in Brazil's vulnerability to landslides and flash
floods in the context of climate change.

PD  - 
AB  - The management of flash floods on the Madeira Island is one of the big
challenges that such territory is facing on modern days concerning
spatial planning. In addition to natural susceptibility, resultant from
the combination of a complex topography and a strongly irregular annual
precipitation pattern, land use deeply contributed to reinforce
vulnerability to such natural disasters. Deep disturbance of native
vegetation by human activities and the location of urban areas at the
terminal section of streams deeply contributed to such situation,
contributing intensely to economic losses and human fatalities, such as
those registered throughout the historical occupation of the island.
Such negative impacts are partly determined by the fact that such flash
floods are associated to heavy transportation of solid material, fed by
landslides. This work aims to evaluate the role of different types of
vegetation on the control of susceptibility to the occurrence of
landslides using by reference the watershed of the Tabua creek.

AB  - This paper analyses some of the main processes that occur during a
flash-flood with a two-dimensional (2D) model (InfoWorks RS with a 2D
module). The data collated in the Valency River after an extreme
rainfall event in the Boscastle area, in the north coast of Cornwall
(UK) in August 2004, are used to analyse such processes. The paper
focuses on blockage of structures, which clearly influences flow
distribution and water levels in the floodplain and on changes in flow
paths by collapse of some structures, which have a relatively local
influence. Changes of channel dimensions due to geomorphological
processes as scour and deposition are also studied, although their
influence is reduced by the effect of bridge blockage. Understanding the
processes that occur in the river during a flash-flood contributes to
the development of risk models to reduce vulnerability.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper describes the development of a method that couples flood
modelling with network analysis to evaluate the accessibility of city
districts by emergency responders during flood events. We integrate
numerical modelling of flood inundation with geographical analysis of
service areas for the Ambulance Service and the Fire & Rescue Service.
The method was demonstrated for two flood events in the City of York, UK
to assess the vulnerability of care homes and sheltered accommodation.
We determine the feasibility of emergency services gaining access within
the statutory 8- and 10-min targets for high priority, life-threatening
incidents 75% of the time, during flood episodes. A hydrodynamic flood
inundation model (FloodMap) simulates the 2014 pluvial and 2015 fluvial
flood events. Predicted floods (with depth >25 cm and areas >100m(2))
were overlain on the road network to identify sites with potentially
restricted access. Accessibility of the city to emergency responders
during flooding was quantified and mapped using; (i) spatial coverage
from individual emergency nodes within the legislated timeframes, and;
(ii) response times from individual emergency service nodes to
vulnerable care homes and sheltered accommodation under flood and
non-flood conditions. Results show that, during the 2015 fluvial flood,
the area covered by two of the three Fire & Rescue Service stations
reduced by 14% and 39% respectively, while the remaining station
needed to increase its coverage by 39%. This amounts to an overall
reduction of 6% and 20% for modelled and observed floods respectively.
During the 2014 surface water flood, 7 out of 22 care homes (32%) and
15 out of 43 sheltered accommodation nodes (35%) had modelled response
times above the 8-min threshold from any Ambulance station. Overall,
modelled surface water flooding has a larger spatial footprint than
fluvial flood events. Hence, accessibility of emergency services may be
impacted differently depending on flood mechanism. Moreover, we expect
emergency services to face greater challenges under a changing climate
with a growing, more vulnerable population. The methodology developed in
this study could be applied to other cities, as well as for
scenario-based evaluation of emergency preparedness to support strategic
decision making, and in real-time forecasting to guide operational
decisions where heavy rainfall lead-time and spatial resolution are
sufficient. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - On 25 October 2011, heavy rainfall affected an area of ca. 1000km(2)
between eastern Liguria and northern Tuscany (northwest Italy). The
event caused floods, hundreds of shallow landslides, four casualties and
severe structural and economic damage in Monterosso and Vernazza
villages. The distribution of geo-hydrological processes triggered by
rainfall in relation to land-use was analyzed in the Vernazza catchment.
Both, an inventory map of geo-hydrological processes and a land-use map
were prepared through air photo-analysis and field surveys; a derivative
map combining these two outputs provides insight into the relationships
between geo-hydrological processes and land-use. The density of shallow
landslides (n/km(2)) and the frequency of erosional processes (%) are
higher in terraced areas compared to other land-use classes. The study
highlights the high vulnerability of agricultural terraces which, over
the centuries, have been a fundamental tool for the prevention and
control of erosional processes and slope instability.

PD  - 
AB  - Across the Mediterranean region, extreme weather events (EWE), such as
high-intensity storms causing flooding in small river basins, are one of
the most common types of hydrometeorological hazards. Flooding has been
associated with severe effects on road networks and a significant number
of vehicle-related fatalities, raising concerns regarding the
performance of transportation infrastructure during EWEs. Given the
expected increase in frequency of such events within the context of
climate change, an assessment of its vulnerability is particularly
crucial. The work presented herein evaluates the performance of
transportation infrastructure during high-intensity storms. This
research focuses on small rural catchments, examining the impact of five
extreme storm events in five rural basins in Greece. Post-flood surveys
were conducted, to record the impact of inundation on each
infrastructure element in the five catchments. Overall, findings showed
that road infrastructure, especially river crossings, performed poorly,
restricting access to large areas during and after the events, affecting
the safety of commuters and sustaining extensive damages. On average, it
was found that 73% of the river crossings and 11.5% of the total
length of the road network were inundated or damaged, while a total of
12 individuals died during the events. The results revealed that the
impact of flooding in the transportation infrastructure of small rural
basins was severe and a threat to human life. The findings of this study
indicate that authorities should consider taking measures during EWEs,
re-examine the safety features of the relevant infrastructure and assess
the risk related to its failure.

AB  - A GIS-based assessment of landslide risk to the Cairns community has
been carried out to provide information to the Cairns City Council for
planning and emergency management purposes. Magnitude recurrence
relations were tentatively established for landslides on the hill
slopes; and large debris flows extending out from the gully systems on
to the plains. From the recurrence relations, landslide hazard was
estimated. The elements at risk were ascertained by interrogating the
GIS, and their vulnerabilities were assessed, Specific risk and total
risk maps were produced. Landslide risk may increase as development
extends further into the hill slopes, Large debris flows could impact on
subdivisions at the base of the slopes. Blockage by landslides of roads
and railways can cause isolation of the community. Flash flooding in
Freshwater Creek, or debris flows, have the potential to disrupt the
Cairns water supply by blocking the intake or destroying sections of the
pipeline.

AB  - Texas ranks first in the U.S in number of fatalities due to natural
disasters. Based on data culled from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 1959 to 2016, the number of
hydrometeorological fatalities in Texas have increased over the 58-year
study period, but the per capita fatalities have significantly
decreased. Spatial review found that non-coastal flooding is the
predominant hydrometeorological disaster in a majority of the Texas
counties located in Flash Flood Alley and accounts for 43% of all
hydrometeorological fatalities in the state. Flooding fatalities occur
most frequently on Transportation Routes followed by heat fatalities in
Permanent Residences. Seasonal and monthly stratification identifies
Spring and Summer as the deadliest seasons, with the month of May
registering the highest number of total fatalities dominated by flooding
and tornado fatalities. Demographic trends of hydrometeorological
disaster fatalities indicated that approximately twice as many male
fatalities occurred from 1959-2016 than female fatalities, but with
decreasing gender disparity over time. Adults are the highest fatality
risk group overall, children are most at risk to die in flooding, and
the elderly at greatest risk of heat-related death.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper reports on research work performed for Floodsite a European
Community-funded project on the social aspects of vulnerability in the
Adige/Sarca river basin of the Trentino-Alto Adige region, Italy. It
identifies some limitations to the use of a fixed set of indicators,
which fail to account for either local peculiarities or the intangible
aspects that contribute to the shaping of social vulnerability. The
authors employed a number of methods to investigate the opinions of
professionals and residents on risk and safety, distinguishing between
the individual and the institutional components of social vulnerability.
Adopting a systemic perspective, they explored the interactions between
these two elements, showing how they may give rise to unexpected
phenomena. The safety paradox and the efficiency paradox are discussed,
emerging when increased protection provided by structural devices and
dedicated institutions translates into a lack of awareness and agency on
the part of residents.

AB  - In the framework of risk assessment for flash floods, vulnerability is a
key concept to assess the susceptibility of elements at risk.
Vulnerability is defined as expected degree of loss for an element at
risk due to a hazard impact of a defined magnitude and frequency.
Besides the increasing number of studies on flash floods available,
in-depth information on vulnerability was missing so far. In order to
close this gap, a vulnerability model was created for micro-sized
enterprises exposed to flash floods in Greece. This model was based on a
nonlinear regression approach using data from four different events. By
means of bootstrapping, different functions were fitted to the data, and
a modified Weibull distribution was found to represent the relationship
between process magnitude and degree of loss best. Moreover, there is no
need to distinguish between different business sectors when computing
vulnerability for buildings exposed. The model can be applied on a local
scale and may serve as a basis for flash flood risk management.

PD  - 
AB  - This study deals with the ``safer island concept{''} implemented for the
reconstruction and rehabilitation works after the 26 December 2004
Indian Ocean Tsunami in the Maldives. The safer island concept has been
developed as an important adaptation strategy for tsunamis as well as
the sea-level rise due to climate change. Reconstruction work in
Dhuvaafaru Island to rehabilitate the entire population of Kandholhudhoo
Island of Raa atoll is chosen as a case study. The appropriateness of
the functionality of the redesigned island to provide security and
safety for the island communities is evaluated using the digital
elevation model.
The study results show that the design enhanced mitigation measures of
the island might show some resilience for less frequent natural
disasters such as smaller tsunamis, while the implementation of the
concept may create greater vulnerability for more frequent disasters,
such as flash floods and storms. An integrated approach with appropriate
risk assessment of floods, storms, and other physical aspects of the
island is recommended for the future development of the safer island
concept.

AB  - Risk assessment and protection of the built infrastructure for flood
events The increase in number, intensity and damage of extreme natural
events is a growing threat to public security and for the built
infrastructure. The following article explains the risk management with
respect to flood. In the context of national and international research
projects, the authors develop practical engineering-tools for a fast
determination of the vulnerability of the built infrastructure, like
public buildings and transport infrastructures, in order to derive risk
assessments in disaster events and to provide decision support for
rescue forces. The engineering-tools include, among other things, a
decision-support-system with recommendations for strengthening and
repairing of structures in the case of major flooding. Structures are
evaluated with rapid analysis, but also with detailed numerical
calculation. The research projects are interdisciplinary
joint-research-projects and the authors are working at different aspects
for the assessment of the built infrastructure. For the effects on built
infrastructure during flood and for prevention of disaster events, there
is no standardization at hand. There are just a few guidelines for the
protection of structures for a flood event. For this reason load models
for static and dynamic loads during a flood are developed, in order to
create a basis for the assessment of robustness of structures. The
determination of the remaining carrying capacity during and after a
flood event is in the primary focus. This is the basis for the analysis
of the resilience of the built infrastructure. In this article the
implementation of the classical action strategy in disaster management
(pre-, during-, post-incident) in a software-tool is presented and with
that, innovative methods with geo-information-systems (GIS) and 3D-city-
and building models (BIM) are shown.

AB  - Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) was applied to Greater Lisbon
(Portugal). Based on the concepts used for the SoVI assessments in the
US, 46 variables representing social vulnerability of the 149 civil
parishes of Greater Lisbon were chosen. Thirty-eight variables were
selected after application of correlation tests. They were standardized,
and a Principal Component Analysis and a Varimax rotation were applied
to them. Seven factors were extracted using the Kaiser criterion, which
explain 79.5% of the variance, and the SoVI scores were then mapped
using a standard deviation classification. Twelve of the 149 civil
parishes of Greater Lisbon have a very high social vulnerability and 24
of them have a high social vulnerability. The map of SoVI was then
integrated with susceptibility maps of earthquakes, floods, flash
floods, landslides, tsunami, and coastal erosion, thus delineating risk
zones. Twenty-two civil parishes of Greater Lisbon have a very high
risk; among them, 17 belong to Lisbon Municipality, four belong to
Loures Municipality, and one belongs to Vila Franca de Xira
Municipality. Finally, exposed population was considered and combined
with risk zones map in order to assess the number of people being
potentially exposed to risk and their location.

T1  - Exploring community risk perceptions of climate change - A case study of a flood-prone urban area of Taiwan
A1  - Chiang, Yi-Chang
Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - The regional phenomenon of heavy rainfall under global climate change is
extremely likely to induce flash floods in flood-prone urban areas and
endanger the lives and safety of residents. Due to its low-lying land
and the overdevelopment of urban areas, Hsinchuang District in New
Taipei City, situated in the Taliaokeng River basin, is subject to
routine flooding on some of its streets after heavy rainfall in a
changing climate. Faced with the challenge, this study provides insights
into risk perceptions of flood-prone communities that should be factored
in risk communication to foster adaptive actions in responding to
climate change. It is underscored that community perception of climate
change is a factor in increasing local awareness of climate risk. The
study used Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) cause-effect
model as the information flow framework to assess community
vulnerability and risk perceptions throughout semi-structured interview
process. The focus was put on how the community risk perceptions were
shaped in the context of social amplification of risk in responding to
climate change. This methodological approach underscores community risk
perceptions are an inherent part of the decision-making process, and
helps to enhance adaptive actions of flood-prone communities. The study
also underlined the risk communication in groups and social networks
that contribute to the integration of structural and non-structural
measures to advance understanding of community risk perceptions of
future climate.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Climate change is expected to result in an increase in the frequency and
intensity of extreme weather events. In turn, this will result in more
frequent occurrences of extreme flood events, such as flash flooding and
large-scale river flooding. This being the case, there is a need for
more accurate flood risk assessment schemes, particularly in areas prone
to extreme flooding. This study investigates what type of flood hazard
assessment methods should be used for assessing the flood hazard to
people caused by extreme flooding. Two flood hazard assessment criteria
were tested, namely: a widely used, empirically derived method, and
recently introduced, physically based and experimentally calibrated
method. The two selected flood hazard assessment methods were: (1)
validated against experimental data, and (2) used to assess flood hazard
indices for two different extreme flood events, namely: the 2010
Kostanjevica na Krki extreme river flood and the 2007 A1/2elezniki flash
flood. The results obtained in this study suggest that in the areas
prone to extreme flooding, the flood hazard indices should be based on
using the formulae derived for a mechanics-based analysis, as these
formulations consider all of the physical forces acting on a human body
in floodwaters, take into account the rapid changes in the flow regime,
which often occur for extreme flood events, and enable a rapid
assessment of the degree of flood hazard risk in a short time period, a
feature particularly important when assessing flood hazard indices for
high Froude numbers flows.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - In this paper a method is proposed to identify mountainous watersheds
with the highest flood risk at the regional level. Through this, the
watersheds to be subjected to more detailed risk studies can be
prioritised in order to establish appropriate flood risk management
strategies. The prioritisation is carried out through an index composed
of a qualitative indicator of vulnerability and a qualitative flash
flood/debris flow susceptibility indicator. At the regional level,
vulnerability was assessed on the basis of a principal component
analysis carried out with variables recognised in literature to
contribute to vulnerability, using watersheds as the unit of analysis.
The area exposed was obtained from a simplified flood extent analysis at
the regional level, which provided a mask where vulnerability variables
were extracted. The vulnerability indicator obtained from the principal
component analysis was combined with an existing susceptibility
indicator, thus providing an index that allows the watersheds to be
prioritised in support of flood risk management at regional level.
Results show that the components of vulnerability can be expressed in
terms of three constituent indicators: (i) socio-economic fragility,
which is composed of demography and lack of well-being; (ii) lack of
resilience and coping capacity, which is composed of lack of education,
lack of preparedness and response capacity, lack of rescue capacity,
cohesiveness of the community; and (iii) physical exposure, which is
composed of exposed infrastructure and exposed population. A sensitivity
analysis shows that the classification of vulnerability is robust for
watersheds with low and high values of the vulnerability indicator,
while some watersheds with intermediate values of the indicator are
sensitive to shifting between medium and high vulnerability.

affect urban areas, especially in mountain regions where flooding is
frequent because of the precipitation characteristics and orographic
configuration. In this study the vulnerability of the central sector of
the Pyrenees to flood events was investigated using frequency analysis
of daily flow and precipitation data for the period from 1940 to 2012
for the headwaters of the Aragon and sera rive. The land use evolution
overt he past 60 years was also analyzed. The return periods showed that
floods have not been exceptional, and the high flow frequency has been
large and closely related to precipitation events. This, combined with a
large increase in human occupation, particularly since the 1990s, of
fluvial areas associated with the land use evolution since 1956, has
increased exposuer to flood risks.

PD  - 
AB  - Floods in cities are increasingly common as a consequence of multifactor
watershed dynamics, including geomorphology, land-use changes and land
subsidence. However, urban managers have focused on infrastructure to
address floods by reducing blocked sewage infrastructure, without
significant success. Using Mexico City as a case study, we generated a
spatial flood risk model with geomorphology and anthropogenic variables.
The results helped contrast the implications of different public
policies in land use and waste disposal, and correlating them with flood
hazards. Waste disposal was only related to small floods. 58% of the
city has a high risk of experiencing small floods, and 24% of the city
has a risk for large floods. Half of the population with the lowest
income is located in the high-risk areas for large floods. These models
are easy to build, generate fast results and are able to help to flood
policies, by understanding flood interactions in urban areas within the
watershed.

PD  - 
AB  - Flash-flood forecasting has emerged worldwide due to the catastrophic
socio-economic impacts this hazard might cause and the expected increase
of its frequency in the future. In mountain catchments,
precipitation-runoff forecasts are limited by the intrinsic complexity
of the processes involved, particularly its high rainfall variability.
While process-based models are hard to implement, there is a potential
to use the random forest algorithm due to its simplicity, robustness and
capacity to deal with complex data structures. Here a step-wise
methodology is proposed to derive parsimonious models accounting for
both hydrological functioning of the catchment (e.g., input data,
representation of antecedent moisture conditions) and random forest
procedures (e.g., sensitivity analyses, dimension reduction, optimal
input composition). The methodology was applied to develop short-term
prediction models of varying time duration (4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 h) for a
catchment representative of the Ecuadorian Andes. Results show that the
derived parsimonious models can reach validation efficiencies
(Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient) from 0.761 (4-h) to 0.384 (24-h) for
optimal inputs composed only by features accounting for 80% of the
model's outcome variance. Improvement in the prediction of extreme peak
flows was demonstrated (extreme value analysis) by including
precipitation information in contrast to the use of pure autoregressive
models.

of disasters. The Nexpa River mountainous basin is in the Sierra-Costa
region of the state of Michoacan, Mexico. The dispersed rural
settlements in the basin, accessed through a network of mainly minor
roads and tracks, are highly vulnerable in cases of catastrophic
hydrometeorological events. Our study aimed to map flood zones and
assess flood susceptibility in the basin on the basis of geopedology,
topography, land cover and land use, to assess the vulnerability of
local rural settlements and their network of roads and tracks. The land
morphology was mapped and the weighted overlay technique was applied in
a geographic information system to generate maps of susceptibility to
flooding. Our results showed that 13% of settlements and 7% of the
communication network are within flood zones. Maps based on
environmental factors showed low to medium susceptibility to flooding.
These methods are useful and effective for zones with little or no
hydrometeorological information, and they can provide a robust source of
information for decision makers regarding land planning to mitigate
flood vulnerability.

AB  - This chapter analyzes the flood disasters and effectiveness of land use
planning and enforcement in Swat Valley, eastern Hindu Kush, north
Pakistan. In Swat Valley, flooding is a recurrently occurring
phenomenon. In upper reaches flash flood characteristics dominate, while
downstream Madyan river flooding dominates the scene. Downstream Madyan,
Swat River enters into a wide basin and braided into numerous channels.
The meandering river is frequently changing its course. In Swat Valley,
almost every year in summer, the peak discharge overflows the natural
levees and in effect causes damages to scarce agricultural land,
housing, and other sectors. While in certain areas, deep riverbank
erosion is very active and engulfing the farmland and built-up areas.
Primarily, the active floodplain of Swat River was a vast grazing land,
but with passage of time, the increasing population has used it for
cultivation and other developments without taking into consideration
risk of floods. This in turn has enhanced the flood vulnerability to
various developments. For centuries people lived within the valley of
Swat River with the reality of flooding as a natural hazard and with the
fact that it has a potential to cause damages to people and their
belongings, but so for no attention has been given to land use
regulation and zoning. Land use regulations have been widely used as a
non-structural flood mitigation strategy in reducing exposure of people
and their property. It was found from the analysis that frequent human
encroachments onto the flood channel and absence of land use regulations
have been identified as the major factors responsible for heavy flood
losses. Looking into potential and challenges in land use planning, this
is high time to undertake fluvial morphology and rainfall-runoff model
for flood risk assessment and spatial land use planning.

T1  - Local models for rainstorm-induced hazard analysis on Mediterranean river-torrential geomorphological systems
A1  - Diodato, N
Y1  - 2004///
PD  - 
AB  - Damaging hydrogeomorphological events are defined as one or more
simultaneous phenomena (e.g. accelerated erosions, landslides, flash
floods and river floods), occurring in a spatially and temporal random
way and triggered by rainfall with different intensity and extent. The
storm rainfall values are highly dependent on weather condition and
relief. However, the impact of rainstorms in Mediterranean mountain
environments depend mainly on climatic fluctuations in the short and
long term, especially in rainfall quantity. An algorithm for the
characterisation of this impact, called Rainfall Hazard Index (RHI), is
developed with a less expensive methodology. In RHI modelling, we assume
that the river-torrential system has adapted to the natural hydrological
regime. and a sudden fluctuation in this regime, especially those
exceeding thresholds for an acceptable range of flexibility, may have
disastrous consequences for the mountain environment. RHI integrate two
rainfall variables based upon storm depth current and historical data,
both of a fixed duration, and a one-dimensionless parameter
representative of the degree ecosystem flexibility. The approach was
applied to a test site in the Benevento river-torrential landscape,
Campania (Southern Italy). So, a database including data from 27 events
which have occurred during an 77-year period (1926-2002) was compared
with Benevento-station RHI(24h), for a qualitative validation. Trends in
RHIx for annual maximum storms of duration 1, 3 and 24 h were also
examined. Little change is observed at the 3- and 24-h duration of a
storm, but a significant increase results in hazard of a short and
intense storm (RHIx((1h))), in agreement with a reduction in return
period for extreme rainfall events.

T1  - A synthesized biophysical and social vulnerability assessment for Taiwan
A1  - Lee, Yung-Jaan
A1  - Wang, H
Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Taiwan, located in the Western Pacific, is a country that is one of the
most vulnerable to disasters that are associated with the changing
climate; it is located within the Ring of Fire, which is the most
geologically active region in the world. The environmental and
geological conditions in Taiwan are sensitive and vulnerable to such
disasters. Owing to increasing urbanization in Taiwan, floods and
climate-related disasters have taken an increasing toll on human lives.
As global warming accelerates the rising of sea levels and increasing of
the frequency of extreme weather events, disasters will continue to
affect socioeconomic development and human conditions. Under such
circumstances, researchers and policymakers alike must recognize the
importance of providing useful knowledge concerning vulnerability,
disaster recovery and resilience. Strategies for reducing vulnerability
and climate-related disaster risks and for increasing resilience involve
preparedness, mitigation and adaptation. In the last two decades,
extreme climate events have caused severe flash floods, debris flows,
landslides, and other disasters and have had negative effects of many
sectors, including agriculture, infrastructure and health. Since climate
change is expected to have a continued impact on socio-economic
development, this work develops a vulnerability assessment framework
that integrates both biophysical and social vulnerability and supports
synthesized vulnerability analyses to identify vulnerable areas in
Taiwan. Owing to its geographical, geological and climatic features,
Taiwan is susceptible to earthquakes, typhoons, droughts and various
induced disasters. Therefore, Taiwan has the urgent task of establishing
a framework for assessing vulnerability as a planning and policy tool
that can be used to identify not only the regions that require special
attention but also hotspots in which efforts should be made to reduce
vulnerability and the risk of climate-related disaster. To analyze the
biophysical vulnerability of Taiwan, hazards on eight maps from Taiwan's
National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) are
analyzed. Statistical data from the NCDR on social vulnerability are
also adopted. Finally, a GIS overlaying method was used to perform the
synthesized vulnerability analysis of biophysical and social
vulnerability for municipalities and counties in Taiwan.

T1  - Characterization of Flood Hazard at a Municipal Level. A Case Study in Tillaberi Region, Niger

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - The occurrence of flooding ranks top among natural disasters in terms of
both the number of people affected globally, and the proportion of
individual fatalities per case. The potential for flood causalities and
damages is increasing in Africa due to social and demographic
development raising pressure on land use. Furthermore, the evidence of
increasingly heavy precipitation due to climate change supports the view
that flood hazard is expected to increase in frequency and severity in
many areas of Niger.
Niger is one of the countries most vulnerable to climatic risks, and the
Tillaberi region is exposed to different typologies of floods: flash
floods associated with short, high intensity rainfalls, mainly of
convective origin and occurring locally, and floods on larger
catchments, such as the Niger River, where dangerous episodes derive
from a regional combination of precipitations and runoff effects. As
such, flash flooding usually impact basins less than 1,000 km(2) with
response times of a few hours or less, while large river basins have the
response times of several days to months. Investigating these aspects in
this area is difficult due to a lack of systematic observational data
for flash floods, encompassing data on the flood-generating rainfall at
the required space and time detail.
This case study aims to support local institutions and organizations in
the design and implementation of disaster risk management policies in
reducing Niger's vulnerability to recurrent natural disasters, as well
as integrating the role of local authorities in building community
disaster prevention and preparedness. The study proposes a methodology
to classify each single municipality in the Tillaberi region based on
its specific flood hazard characterization.

T1  - Assessment of Vulnerability to Extreme Flash Floods in Design Storms
A1  - Kim, Eung Seok

Y1  - 2011///
PD  - 
AB  - There has been an increase in the occurrence of sudden local flooding of
great volume and short duration caused by heavy or excessive rainfall
intensity over a small area, which presents the greatest potential
danger threat to the natural environment, human life, public health and
property, etc. Such flash floods have rapid runoff and debris flow that
rises quickly with little or no advance warning to prevent flood damage.
This study develops a flash flood index through the average of the same
scale relative severity factors quantifying characteristics of
hydrographs generated from a rainfall-runoff model for the long-term
observed rainfall data in a small ungauged study basin, and presents
regression equations between rainfall characteristics and the flash
flood index. The aim of this study is to develop flash flood
index-duration-frequency relation curves by combining the rainfall
intensity-duration-frequency relation and the flash flood index from
probability rainfall data in order to evaluate vulnerability to extreme
flash floods in design storms. This study is an initial effort to
quantify the flash flood severity of design storms for both existing and
planned flood control facilities to cope with residual flood risks due
to extreme flash floods that have ocurred frequently in recent years.

AB  - This preliminary investigation of the recent spate of deadly flash
floods and debris flows in Ladakh (India) over the last decade
identifies uncontrolled development in hazardous locations as an
important factor contributing to loss of life and property damage in
this high mountain desert. The sediments exposed in the channel banks
and on the alluvial fans of several mountain streams in the area
indicate a long history of flash floods and debris flows resulting from
intense storms, which appear to have increased in frequency within the
last decade. The signposts of these recurrent hazards are being ignored
as a growing economy, which is boosted by a well-established tourism
industry, is now driving development onto lands that are susceptible to
floods and debris flow hazards. In this science briefing we argue that
the increasing vulnerability in Ladakh should be addressed with sound
disaster governance strategies that are proactive, rather than
reactionary. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Coastal regions are the areas most threatened by natural hazards, with
floods being the most frequent and significant threat in terms of their
induced impacts, and therefore, any management scheme requires their
evaluation. In coastal areas, flooding is a hazard associated with
various processes acting at different scales: coastal storms, flash
floods, and sea level rise (SLR). In order to address the problem as a
whole, this study presents a methodology to undertake a preliminary
integrated risk assessment that determines the magnitude of the
different flood processes (flash flood, marine storm, SLR) and their
associated consequences, taking into account their temporal and spatial
scales. The risk is quantified using specific indicators to assess the
magnitude of the hazard (for each component) and the consequences in a
common scale. This allows for a robust comparison of the spatial risk
distribution along the coast in order to identify both the areas at
greatest risk and the risk components that have the greatest impact.
This methodology is applied on the Maresme coast (NW Mediterranean,
Spain), which can be considered representative of developed areas of the
Spanish Mediterranean coast. The results obtained characterise this
coastline as an area of relatively low overall risk, although some hot
spots have been identified with high-risk values, with flash flooding
being the principal risk process.

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - The probability of the occurrence of urban flash floods has increased
appreciably in recent years. Scientists have published various articles
related to the estimation of the vulnerability of people and vehicles in
urban areas resulting from flash floods. However, most published works
are based on research performed using numerical models and laboratory
experiments. This paper presents a novel approach that combines the
implementation of image velocimetry technique (large-scale particle
image velocimetry-LSPIV) using a flash flood video recorded by the
public locally and the estimation of the vulnerability of people and
vehicles to high water velocities in urban areas. A numerical
oneaEurodimensional hydrodynamic model has also been used in this
approach for water velocity characterization. The results presented in
this paper correspond to a flash flood resulting on November 29, 2012,
in the city of Asuncin in Paraguay. During this flash flood, people and
vehicles were observed being carried away because of high water
velocities. Various sequences of the recorded flash flood video were
characterized using LSPIV. The results obtained in this work validate
the existing vulnerability criterion based on the effect of the flash
flood and resulting high water velocities on people and vehicles.

T1  - Flood Surprise: Flash Floods and Inundation far away from Watercourses
A1  - Kron, Wolfgang
Y1  - 2009///
PD  - 
AB  - In most cases, flash floods and off-plain flooding occur locally,
sometimes far away from a watercourse. They happen in great number every
year, taking everyone completely by surprise. The losses from single
events are in the order of four- to six-digit euros, but may reach more
than one hundred million in some cases, even locally. Land-use changes,
increasing values and vulnerabilities, and climatic changes have lead to
more frequent and costly incidents of this kind. Structural protection
against this type of hazard is very limited, because any given place can
be hit. Early warning and reaction to an alert do not guarantee much
protection either, as these events happen too rapidly. The best way to
manage the risk of flash floods is to seek natural perils insurance. The
prerequisite for sufficient market penetration is to increase the
understanding and awareness of people that everyone is exposed to such a
surprise event.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper aims to analyse and compare the loss of life that occurred
during two recent floods in France. The first flood was due to a sea
surge triggered by the storm called Xynthia that hit the Atlantic coast
on 28 February 2010 (41 flood-related deaths). The second was a flash
flood that struck the Var Department in the French Mediterranean region
on 15 June 2010 (26 fatalities). After detailing the assumptions and
expected outcomes of the study of disaster-related fatalities, the paper
focuses on the characteristics of the victims and the circumstances of
their deaths. In the first case, 71% of the victims were people aged
over 60 (mainly women) who were surprised while they were sleeping and
who died in or near their homes. In the case of the flash flood, the
profiles of the victims were diverse as the flooding occurred in the
afternoon and many people were trapped in open. The paper also
highlights the factors that explain mortality. Physical factors such as
water depth were determined. The relationship between the water depth
and the age of victims was found to be relevant. In the case of the
storm surge Xynthia, the correlation between age and water depth is
positive. For the flash flood, the correlation between age and water
depth was negative as male adults died in open. In the first case, the
vulnerability of people was closely linked to human features such as
type of housing and age that people are not directly responsible for.
During flash floods, dangerous behaviour by people highlighted the role
of risk-taking in loss of life. We also examined the particular case of
the deaths of the children. The paper concludes by discussing the
factors of vulnerability on frail population such as elderly people or
marginalized. The lack of risk awareness and crisis preparedness were
clearly a major factor of vulnerability.

PD  - 
AB  - A novel method has been proposed in this study for delineation of
flood-prone areas through integration of catastrophe theory and
analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in a geographical information system.
Seven causative flood factors were selected for this purpose based on
data availability and literature reviews, namely, ground surface
elevation, slope angle, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream
power index, curve numbers, and distance from intermittent streams. The
raster maps of the factors were prepared with a cell size of 30 x 30 m.
The catastrophe models were used to derive weights of the factors using
weighted linear combination technique, while AHP was used to compute
normalized ranks of the classes of each factor. The model was applied to
demarcate the flood-prone zones in northeastern parts of Southern Iraq,
where flash flood is a recurrent natural hazard that causes damage to
property almost every year. The study revealed that about 852 km(2) (41
%) of the study area is less susceptible, 434 km(2) (21 %) is moderate
susceptible and 812 km(2) (38 %) is high susceptible to flood. The high
flood-susceptible zones are mainly distributed around the intermittent
streams and the low lands in the southeast, while the low
flood-susceptible zones are found in the east and northeast hilly
regions of the study area. The obtained result matches well with general
conception of flood-prone zones in the region, which indicates that
integration of catastrophe theory and AHP can provide a low cost and
easily implementable method for reliable mapping of flush
flood-susceptible zones.

AB  - Recent flash flood impact studies highlight that road networks are often
disrupted due to adverse weather and flash flood events. Road users are
thus particularly exposed to road flooding during their daily mobility.
Previous exposure studies, however, do not take into consideration
population mobility. Recent advances in transportation research provide
an appropriate framework for simulating individual travelactivity
patterns using an activity-based approach. These activity-based mobility
models enable the prediction of the sequence of activities performed by
individuals and locating them with a high spatial-temporal resolution.
This paper describes the development of the MobRISK microsimulation
system: a model for assessing the exposure of road users to extreme
hydrometeorological events. MobRISK aims at providing an accurate
spatiotemporal exposure assessment by integrating travel-activity
behaviors and mobility adaptation with respect to weather disruptions.
The model is applied in a flash-flood-prone area in southern France to
assess motorists' exposure to the September 2002 flash flood event. The
results show that risk of flooding mainly occurs in principal road links
with considerable traffic load. However, a lag time between the timing
of the road submersion and persons crossing these roads contributes to
reducing the potential vehicle-related fatal accidents. It is also found
that sociodemographic variables have a significant effect on individual
exposure. Thus, the proposed model demonstrates the benefits of
considering spatiotemporal dynamics of population exposure to flash
floods and presents an important improvement in exposure assessment
methods. Such improved characterization of road user exposures can
present valuable information for flood risk management services.

AB  - Flash floods are responsible for a majority of natural disaster
fatalities in the USA and Europe and most of them are vehicle-related.
If human exposure to flood is generally assessed through the number of
inhabitants per buildings located in flood prone zone, it is clear that
this number varies dramatically throughout the day as people move from
place to place to follow their daily program of activities. Knowing the
number of motorists exposed on flood prone road sections or the factors
determining their exposure would allow providing a more realistic
evaluation of the degree of exposure. In order to bridge this gap and
provide emergency managers with methods to assess the risk level for
motorists, this paper describes two methods, a simple rough-and-ready
estimate and a traffic attribution method, and applies both of them on
datasets of the Gard departement, an administrative region of Southern
France with about 700000 inhabitants over 5875 km(2). The first method
to obtain an overall estimation of motorists flood exposure is to
combine (i) the regional density of roads and rivers to derive a count
of potential road cuts and (ii) the average daily kilometers driven by
commuters of the study area to derive the number of people passing these
potential cuts. If useful as a first approximation, this method fails to
capture the spatial heterogeneities introduced by the geometry of river
and road networks and the distribution of commuters' itineraries. To
address this point, this paper (i) uses a pre-established detailed
identification of road cuts (Naulin et al., 2013) and (ii) applies a
well-known traffic attribution method to existing and freely available
census datasets.
Both methods indicate that commuters' exposure is much larger than the
number of commuters itself, illustrating the risk amplification effect
of mobility. Comparing the results from both methods shows that (i) the
road network geometry plays a significant role in reducing the risk of
river-road dangerous intersections and (ii) not all commuters are
equally exposed. Evidently commuters who have longer routes are more
exposed, but residents of rural municipalities as well as professionals
with highly qualified jobs are also more exposed. Finally, these
exposure assessment methods applied to the Gard area allows locating
road sections where commuters' exposure to flood is high. It also sets
the first step toward the implementation of a modeling platform able to
combine the estimation of daily travel patterns exposure and behavioral
response of motorists to road flooding, a critical input for emergency
services and services in charge of the management of road networks in
flash flood prone areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

distribution of flash flooding in urban areas. It examines an extreme
precipitation event that occurred in 2013, in Athens, Greece, causing
flooding and damages in various parts of the city. GIS was used to
determine the values of potentially flood-influencing parameters, while
logistic regression was used to examine the statistical correlation
between their values and the respective values at the locations of 1138
flooded buildings. Statistical significance and other metrics were used
to measure the influence of these factors on the distribution of
flooding. Results showed that certain factors, including the degree of
soil sealing, accumulated rainfall, slope and others, influence the
distribution of flooding to significantly different degrees.
Incorporation of building characteristics into the regression model
increased further its coherence. The study showed a strong relationship
between a combination of factors and flood occurrence with R-2 reaching
0.63 and a prediction accuracy of 82.9%. The degree of soil sealing and
slope were the most influential in determining the distribution of
flooding. However, when building parameters were incorporated, the level
of a building's lower opening in comparison with ground level was by a
significant margin the most important parameter. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Yunnan Province, located in Southwest China, suffers from massive flash
flood hazards due to its complex mountainous hydrometeorology. However,
traditional flash flood forecasting approaches can hardly provide an
effective and comprehensive guide. Aiming to build a multilevel guidance
system of flash flood warning for Yunnan, this study develops a
Cascading Flash Flood Guidance (CFFG) system, progressively from the
Flash Flood Potential Index (FFPI), the Flash Flood Hazard Index (FFHI)
to the Flash Flood Risk Index (FFRI). First, land cover and vegetation
cover data from MODIS products, the Harmonized World Soil Database soil
map, and SRTM slope data are used in generating a composite FFPI map. In
this process, an integrated approach of the analytic hierarchy process
and the information entropy theory is used as a weighting method. Then,
three standardized rainfall amounts (average daily amount in flood
seasons, maximum 6 h and maximum 24 h amount) are added to derive FFHI.
Further inclusion of GDP, population and flood prevention measures as
vulnerability factors for the FFRI enabled prediction of the flash flood
risk. The spatial patterns of the CFFG indices indicate that counties in
east Yunnan are most susceptible to flash floods, which agrees with the
distribution of observed flash flood events. Compared to other
approaches, the CFFG system could be a useful prototype in mapping
characteristics of China's flash floods in a cascading manner (i.e.,
potential, hazard and risk) for users at different administrative levels
(e.g., town, county, province and even nation).

AB  - Golestan province located in NE Iran is well known for deadly flash
floods. This study aimed to evaluate the region's Early Warning System
(EWS) for flash floods. We used an adapted version of the questionnaire
developed by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster
Reduction. We reviewed documents on the EWS of Golestan, and conducted a
qualitative study comprising interviews with experts and affected people
in Kalaleh and Minoodasht. Results were discussed by an expert panel.
Regarding risk knowledge, there was a hazard map at Provincial Disaster
Taskforce (PDT) drawn by the provincial Office for Water Resource
Management, but no risk analysis was available. Local people were aware
of their exposure to flooding, but not aware of the existence of a
hazard map and their vulnerability situation. In terms of monitoring and
warning, PDT faced serious limitations in issuing Early Warnings,
including (1) an inability to make point predictions of rainfall, and
(2) the absence of a warning threshold. Dissemination and communication
issued by the Meteorological Office followed a top-to-bottom direction.
The contents were neither clearly understood by other institutions nor
reached the potential recipients within an appropriate time frame. There
was a need for a comprehensive response plan with adequate exercises,
and no evaluation framework existed. Golestan EWS is in dire need of
improvement. To fill in the gaps ensuring local people receive timely
warning, we propose a community-based model called ``Village Disaster
Taskforce{''} (VDT) in which individual villages act as operational
units, but interlinked with other villages and PDT.

AB  - The risk presented by pluvial flooding has emerged as a critical issue
in urban water management. Pluvial flooding occurs when precipitation
intensity exceeds the capacity of natural and engineered drainage
systems, and it is expected to increase in frequency, severity and
impact through the 21st century due to the combined effects of climate
change and urbanization. Although there have been recent advances in
approaches to assess the risk presented pluvial flooding and to enhance
the resilience of cities to its impacts, they have not been broadly
implemented and there are many opportunities for additional research. We
provide case studies of pluvial flooding in six cities in the
continental United States, which serve as examples of the current
vulnerability of cities that have not developed comprehensive pluvial
flood management plans and the challenges in conducting pluvial flood
research in light of existing data gaps. We also identify key research
challenges that should be prioritized by the interdisciplinary water
research community to better support urban resilience practice. This

Riyadh metro project in the generation of flash floods around the
proposed metro lines. The results of the spatial distributions of
modelled annual runoff depth varied from 9 to 180 mm/year, and annual
runoff depth around the proposed metro lines ranged from 70 to 120
mm/year. The major cause of floods in Al-Riyadh province is the
occurrence of extremely heavy rainfall over a short period and low water
absorptive capacity of soil, leading to an increased overland flow.
Therefore, despite the total rainfall amount being relatively small in
Riyadh province, Saudi Arabia, the rainfall event can be very intense,
hence causing problems of flooding. The high-potential risk of flash
floods is within areas around line 1, 2, 4, and 6. The analysis
indicates that construction of the Riyadh Metro will lead to an annual
increase in the flash flood generation in the urban regions. The DSS was
implemented to obtain suitability maps and to evaluate the existing
SWH/Groundwater recharge (GWR) structures in the study area. The DSS
inputs comprised maps of rainfall surplus, slope, runoff coefficient
(RC), land cover/use, and soil type. Based on an analytical hierarchy
process analysis taking into account five layers, the spatial extents of
SWH suitability areas were identified by multi-criteria evaluation. The
spatial distribution of the classes in the suitability map showed that
the excellent and good areas are mainly located in the northeastern and
northwestern parts of the study area. The southeastern and west southern
parts almost have the same categories dominated by moderate and poor and
unsuitable areas. On average, 22.17 % (84,356 Km(2)) and 31.56 %
(120,085 Km(2)) of the study area are classified as excellent and good
for SWH, respectively, while 23.98 % (91, 243 Km(2)) and 22.28%(84,775
Km(2)) of the area are classified as moderately suitable and poorly
suited and unsuitable, respectively. Most of the areas with excellent to
good suitability have slopes between 2 and 8 % and are intensively
cultivated areas. Rainfall in these areas ranges from 120 to 230 mm.
Most of the existing SWH/GWR structures that are categorized as
successful were within the excellent (89.1 % of the structures) areas
followed by good suitable (10.9 of the structures). Overall, results
indicated that wadi Hanifah and Wadi Nisah have a moderate vulnerability
to flooding, with high vulnerability in the northeast part of Al-Riyadh
province. The use of a number of SWH sites in the excellent areas is
recommended to ensure successful implementation of SWH systems.

Y1  - 2007///
PD  - 
AB  - After severe flash floods that caused many fatalities a few years ago in
the Mediterranean regions of France, the French government decided to
help local authorities to reduce flood risk. Through the example of
small basins in southern France, this paper shows the principles and the
practises involved in mitigating flood risk. The flood risk management
plans, established by river basin authorities, are subsidized both by
the central government and by local authorities. They illustrate the
progressive change of philosophy in flood management policy. The
principles of flood risk management have changed through history from
structural measures (dikes, embankments, dams) to non-structural methods
(e.g., land-use planning, preparedness measures, reduction of
vulnerability, early-warning systems, human collective memory and public
awareness). The flood risk management policies are thus politically and
technically integrated. This paper points out some of the reasons that
can explain the success or the failure of flood risk reduction in a
river basin. It shows how partisan politics can be an obstacle to the
implementation of such plans. The last challenge is to evaluate the
positive and negative effects of the flood-mitigation policies. This
work finishes by proposing some indicators to evaluate the real effects
of flood reduction.

AB  - People entering floodwaters by vehicle constitutes a major cause of
flood fatalities in Australia and globally. Over the 20 years to 2014,
81 people have died attempting to drive through floodwaters. These
comprise 43 per cent of all flood fatalities for this period. Despite
Australian emergency services agencies mounting behavioural change
campaigns and urging people not to enter floodwater, the behaviour
persists. This paper draws on fieldwork carried out during flooding in
the Shoalhaven region of NSW, Australia, in August 2015 to examine the
effectiveness of the current combination of warnings, education and road
signage to stop motorists entering floodwater. The fieldwork identified
that 84 per cent of drivers at a monitored site, notably males and
four-wheel-drive (4WD) vehicles, dismissed road closure signs and drove
into floodwater. It is plain that further work is needed to reduce the
frequency of motorists entering floodwater. This requires the
development of a holistic approach including education, regulation and
engineering measures.

AB  - Groundwater is a significant water supply source in arid and semi-arid
areas. It plays an important role in the construction of new
communities. As communities grow and land use becomes more intensified,
there are greater demands on groundwater resources. Effective
groundwater. management requires a clear understanding of the quality,
quantity and vulnerability of this valuable resource. The Wadi Abu
Ghusun is considered one of the main basins in the Eastern Desert of
Egypt. It attracts official attention from several sources, including
the Ilmenite mining industry and the World Food Program (WFP) in the
context of the development of Bedouin communities.
Continuous development has led to extensive and increasing demand for
potable water to match these activities. Therefore, the application of
recent techniques in harvesting surface runoff plays a vital role in
groundwater replenishment and avoids great damage to human activities,
buildings and roads. To achieve these targets, a model of
rainfall-runoff processes in an ungauged basin was applied. The
rainfall-runoff model was used to calculate the direct runoff volume,
peak discharge, and to construct a synthetic hydrograph for the Wadi Abu
Ghusun. The flow rate (Q(p)) of the synthetic hydrograph at Wadi Abu
Ghusun was 52.66 m(3)/sec. and the time to peak (t(p)) was 5.58 hours,
whereas the time base (t(b)) is 17.5 hours. The total discharge along
the study basin was 1.88x10(6) m(3). Based on topographic maps
(1:100,000), twenty two morphometric parameters of Wadi Abu Ghusun were
determined. The calculated morphometric parameters as well as the
hydraulic parameters indicate reasonable groundwater potentialities. The
Qantas systems methods of groundwater management were recommended.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - The 1962 Rubi flood was a severe flash flood, the worst to ever take
place in Spain, claiming the lives of more than 800 people following 200
mm of rainfall in 2 h. Such a high number of casualties can be explained
by the very high vulnerability of people who lived in the floodplains of
a wandering, ephemeral stream (a wadi) prone to flash floods. Many
publications to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the flood have been
used as proxy data for the event, especially in terms of social aspects.
The meteorological and pluviometric information is reviewed, while other
information is only found in grey literature. Recently, the event has
been considered an outlier in the panorama of European flash floods.
Because of the above, this paper aims to convey all the information to
readers and show that it deserves to be raised to an international level
as an example of an extreme flash flood. After addressing some
misunderstandings, it can be concluded that the event was not an
outlier, nor was it extreme, in terms of total rainfall, return period,
discharge, discharge per unit basin area, unit stream power and flow
velocity. It may be extraordinary because the flood reached very high
levels by transporting large amounts of both fine and coarse sediment
particles. The stream is steep, ephemeral, lacking an armour layer, and
prone to torrential events, in which the large sediment transport played
a role in how high the flood levels rose. The use of flooding marks to
compute discharges is also discussed. In addition, the paper presents a
torrential calculation based on the momentum principle in a control
volume.

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, is undergoing a critical transition
when the conventionally thought desert climate has been witnessing
`turning-to-be-regular' flash floods. Since 2009, the city has been
repeatedly hit by flash floods that has put further adverse consequences
on the properties and even resulting in death tolls. Such critical
transition has made the think-tanks seriously re-think about the
resilient capacity of the existing infrastructure. Although the city has
been attempted to plan, develop and expand under a number of master
planning regimes, the `emerging-recurrent' flash flood was not
critically considered in the plan making process. However, the recent
MEDSTAR comprehensive strategic development initiative has brought a new
hope with re-conceptualizing the planning strategies in the plan making
and revision processes. Thus, this study attempts to evaluate the
credibility of master plans with an especial focus on MEDSTAR to find
out the resilience power against flash flood driven adverse
consequences. The evaluation is carried out with the lens of social and
physical vulnerabilities of flash floods and associated risks of the
proposed strategies for growth and land use of Riyadh until 2030. The
evaluation suggests that many areas of Riyadh city, formally proposed
with specific land uses, densification and expansion plan, are prone to
both social and physical vulnerabilities of flood in the scale of `high'
to `moderate' vulnerability induced risks. With the aid of composite
flood vulnerability (social and physical) index, therefore, this study
suggests MEDSTAR comprehensive development strategy to undergo another
re-evaluation process that perhaps will strongly influence the current
investment decision on infrastructure to make Riyadh resilient against
the `emerging-recurrent' flash floods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB  - The Evaluation of flood risk is a difficult task due to its numerous and
complex impact factors. This article built a classification and
regression tree (CART) model for the flood risk assessment with the
available data of Hunan Province. This model is able to extract the
major impact factors from many complex variables, determine the factors'
thresholds, and evaluate the levels of flood risk objectively. To
construct the model, 18 explanatory variables were selected as the
influential factors, including meteorological conditions, surface
conditions and social vulnerability. Economic loss density from flood
was chosen as the response variable for the quantitative and
comprehensive evaluation of flood risk. The final model showed that
meteorological conditions have the most significant influence on flood
risk. Additionally, the relationship between meteorological factors and
flood risk is rather complex. The variability of rainstorm days during
the seasonal alternate period from the end of spring (May) to the early
summer (June) is the source of the highest flood risk. In addition, the
regional embankment density and population density as social
vulnerability indicators and the relief degree of land surface as a
surface condition indicator were also included in the flood risk
assessment for Hunan. A region with dense dams appeared at a relatively
higher risk. Densely inhabited areas with greater topographical relief
also demonstrated a higher flood risk in the study area. The conditions
obtained from the final tree for different levels of risk demonstrate
the objectivity of selecting impact factors and a reduction of
complexity for the risk evaluation process. Furthermore, the evaluation
of high-level risk using the proposed method requires fewer conditions,
which allows for a rapid risk assessment of serious floods. The CART
method shows a decreased root mean squared error compared with that of a
multiple linear regression model. In addition, the cross-validation
error was improved for the high-risk levels that represent the most
important classes in risk management. The verification with the
available historical records showed that the output of the model is
reliable. In summary, the CART method is feasible for extracting the
main impact factors and their associated thresholds for the
comprehensive assessment of regional flood risk.

T1  - Vulnerability of HIV/AIDS orphans to floods in Malawi
A1  - Mkandawire, Paul
Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Referred to as the `forgotten causalities' of climate change (Cutter
1995), very few studies have examined the precise nature and magnitude
of climate change impacts on children, let alone on the growing number
of orphans and vulnerable children in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), where
climate change is already expected to exact its worst humanitarian toll.
This paper examines personal, familial, and contextual circumstances
that arise when children lose their parents to HIV/AIDS and how these
situations mediate exposure to the impacts of climate related disasters.
Using the case of flash floods that occurred in Malawi in 2015, and
drawing on perspectives from political ecology and social vulnerability
theory, the findings of a qualitative study (n = 51) suggest that
orphans' vulnerability to floods was mediated by a number of specific
circumstances. These include pre-existing physical health status of
surviving parent or guardian, domestic roles they inherited following
incapacitation or death of a parent, and social norms governing property
inheritance within the traditional extended family system. In addition,
the findings also show that the floods shattered livelihoods, forcing
orphans into prolonged engagement in exploitative labour pursuits.
Furthermore, the findings show that the rainstorm also swept away
mementos left behind by parents, with profound effect on orphans'
emotional wellbeing, which affected their interpretation of the meaning
of the disaster. The study underscores (i) the potential of climate
change to re-configure social relations and entrench orphans'
subordinate status (ii) the historical specificity of the factors that
mediate the effects of climate change on children.

AB  - Urban environments are potentially threatened by changing climate,
especially in form of heat and flash flood hazards. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to assess future urban vulnerability to these
phenomenons. Purpose of this research is to define heat and flash flood
indicators, based on land use, cover and morphology ofurban
environments. We enhanced a standard scheme of local climate zones with
extended urban morphology, which plays a key role in urban heat island
effect. As heat hazard indicator we defined number of days, with fixed
threshold exceeded temperature. Meanwhile for flash flood hazard we
selected Curve Number, which considers soil type, hydrologic condition,
land use, cover and percentage of impervious surface. Both of these
indicators can be related to discrete urban classes and be ranked by
hazard severity. Further step is to model future urban environment
withrelation of heat and flash flood hazards, which eventually will be
incorporated into future urban vulnerability framework.

PD  - 
AB  - Suburban areas have become rapid development zones during China's
current urbanization. Generally, these areas are also regional
precipitation centers that are prone to flood disasters. Therefore, it
is important to assess the flood risk in suburban areas. In this study,
flood risk was defined as the product of hazard and vulnerability based
on disaster risk theory. A risk assessment index system was established,
and the analytic hierarchy process method was used to determine the
index weight. The Fangshan District in Beijing, China, which is an
example of a typical suburban area undergoing rapid urbanization, was
selected for this study. Six factors were considered in relation to
hazard, and three factors were considered for vulnerability. Each
indicator was discretized, standardized, weighted, and then combined to
obtain the final flood risk map in a geographical information system
environment. The results showed that the high and very high risk zones
in the Fangshan District were primarily concentrated on Yingfeng Street,
Xingcheng Street, Xincheng Street, and Chengguanzhen Street. The
comparison to an actual flood disaster suggested that the method was
effective and practical. The method can quantitatively reflect the
relative magnitude and spatial distribution patterns of flood risk in a
region. The method can be applied easily to most suburban areas in China
for land use planning and flood risk management.

AB  - Urban Resilience has recently emerged as a systematic approach to urban
sustainability. The malleable definition of resilience has rendered its
operationalisation an intriguing task for contemporary cities trying to
address their organisational problems and confront uncertainty in a
holistic manner. In this article we investigate the implementation
challenges emerging for Resilient Strategies by the inattention paid to
urban geological risk. We conceptualise urban geological risk as the
combination of urban geohazards, geological vulnerability and exposure
of the built environment and focus on the case study of Thessaloniki,
Greece, a city that joined the 100 Resilient Cities initiative in 2014
and published its ``Resilience Strategy 2030{''} (RS) in 2017. After a
review of the RS, historical records of natural hazard events and with
evidence gathered through interviews with city officials, we emphasize
on earthquakes and surface flooding as the most relevant geohazards for
Thessaloniki to tackle in its journey towards urban resilience. First,
we examine geological vulnerability to earthquakes in conjunction with
exposure of the built environment, as an outcome of ageing building
stock, high building densities and the urban configuration, in
Acheiropoietos neighbourhood, within the historic centre of the city.
Then, we explore geological risk to surface flooding in Perea, in
Thermaikos Municipality, with a particular focus on flash floods, by
demonstrating how limited consideration of local geomorphology as well
as semi-regulated urban expansion and its limited connection with
emergency planning increase exposure of the built environment to surface
flooding. Finally, we come up with the major implementation challenges
Thessaloniki's RS faces with regard to urban geohazards.

PD  - 
AB  - Flood vulnerability assessment is becoming increasingly important around
the world. Nevertheless, the high dimensional and non-linear
relationship between various indices and flood vulnerability greatly
hinders researchers from making a reasonable assessment. Thus, an
integrated flood vulnerability assessment approach is proposed here by
combining a multi-criteria decision making technique, the technique for
order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), with the
Shannon entropy method. The Shannon entropy method is used to account
for the inhomogeneity in the indicator values. TOPSIS uses a
multi-criteria system where hydrodynamic modeling is applied to obtain
the values of exposure indicators. This approach is tested in a rural
district of Hainan Province, China. The flood vulnerability at the town
and administrative village scales is presented through a geographic
information system. By considering the inhomogeneity of the internal
attributes, the integrated assessment approach is eventually proven as a
highly realistic approach for assessing flood vulnerability. The
advantages of this approach become highly pronounced when the evaluation
objects have more internal indicators and the internal inhomogeneity
among the values of these indicators is high. The main driving factors
of flood vulnerability in one district has also been successfully
identified using the proposed integrated method. In sum, this integrated
assessment method can provide decision makers with highly targeted
decision making references to effectively reduce the flood vulnerability
of the study area.

AB  - Floods are natural phenomena with significant impact on population,
material goods and landscape. Flash floods are characterized by a high
degree of risk, primarily due to reduced possibilities to make effective
forecasts, but also because of weather and climatic characteristics that
changed in the last decades, thus limiting the possibilities of
application of appropriate defense and adaptation measures.
In this context, the paper aims to make a preliminary assessment of
vulnerability to flash floods, using hydrological simulation models
based on GIS techniques applied in sub-basins, allowing a ranking of
risks within relevant locations, especially concerning the cultural
heritage in the county of Iasi. The development of methods for
addressing such conditions creates the scientific basis for planning the
required resource allocation for the protection of the cultural heritage
hence for the implementation of water resources management plans and
territorial development plans.

Y1  - 2008///
PD  - 
AB  - The increasing land-use activities in European mountain regions have led
to a considerable threat of natural hazards such as flash floods and
debris flows in areas used for settlement purposes and economic
activities. To mitigate associated losses, traditional protective
measures, including check dams and retention basins, were commonly
implemented by public authorities. However, due to the scarceness of
public funds, efficient protection alternatives have to be developed to
reduce future expenditures. Supplementing the concept of integral risk
management, this efficiency can be obtained by local structural
protection, reducing the vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure
facilities considerably. However, data related to the effects of local
structural protection measures to reduce losses has not been quantified
satisfyingly so far, and the associated decrease in vulnerability has
hardly been measured until now. In this paper, results of a comparative
standardised cost benefit analysis are presented. Different mitigation
strategies were assessed and the benefit of local structural measures
was quantified. The results suggest that local structural measures
reduce the vulnerability of buildings towards natural hazards
considerably, and that they therefore should be considered as either
additional or even alternative mitigation measures.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper presents the sensing aspects and performance evaluation of
the quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) system in an X-band
dual-polarization radar network developed by the Collaborative Adaptive
Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) Engineering Research Center. CASA's
technology enables precipitation observation close to the ground and QPE
is one of the important applications. With expanding urbanization all
over the world, vulnerability to floods has increased from intense
rainfall such as urban flash floods. The QPE products that are derived
at high spatiotemporal resolution, which is enabled by the deployment of
a dense radar network, have the potential to improve the prediction of
flash-flooding threats when coupled with hydrological models. Derivation
of QPE from radar observations is a challenging process, in which the
use of dual-polarization radar variables is advantageous. At X band, the
specific differential propagation phase (K(dp)) between the orthogonal
linear polarization states is particularly appealing. The K(dp) field is
robustly acquired using an adaptive estimation method, and a simple
R(K(dp)) relation is used to perform precipitation estimation in this
X-band radar network. Radar observations and QPE from multiyear field
experiments are used to demonstrate the performance of rainfall
estimation from the single-parameter K(dp)-based rainfall product. The
operational feasibility of radar QPE using an X-band radar network is
critically assessed.

AB  - This paper presents the main issues and developments of a research
conducted in spring 2003 on the basis of post evaluation of the 8th-9th
September 2002 catastrophic flood event. In the purpose of a qualitative
approach of behaviours expressed during the crisis period, we performed
several interviews of inhabitants in three flooded communes of the Gard
department. Based on the importance of casualties linked to motor
vehicles usage during flash flood noted in the literature, we worked on
the hypothesis of a correlation between crisis period displacements and
usual spatial practices. This study allowed distinguishing various types
of behaviours in front of the flood progression. It contributes to the
knowledge of the main behavioural factors in the aim of preventive
planning and crisis management.

AB  - Global climate change has different demonstrable effects on ecosystem
structures and socioeconomic factors throughout the entire planet. 90
percent of last decade natural hazards around the world were attributed
to water-related disasters. Forest-land use change, deforestation,
unplanned urbanization, localization of marginal population groups in
vulnerable areas, wild fires, high temperatures, unusual precipitations,
among others are some of the variables that increase the probability of
a water-related catastrophe. Comprehensive hazard assessments and
appropriated environmental policies orientated towards risk management
complemented with planning and designing of hydraulic infrastructures
may contribute to decrease flash flooding risk a well as the magnitude
of the potential damages. The aim of this study is to develop a
consistent methodology to determine the vulnerability, threat and risk
of mountain urban areas that are particularly vulnerable to the effects
of heavy, rapid rains and represent the obtained results in a risk map.
Identifying risk prone areas can be achieved by adapting
geological-geotechnical charts, hydrological models, field inventories
and official census data from the town of Unquillo, in the province of
Cordoba, Argentina. The analytic hierarchy process was used in order to
determine the individual contribution of each vulnerability factor,
together with geographical information systems used to combine the
obtained information trough algebra and transformation of satellite
imagery bands. The case of study show that 59% of the total flooding
vulnerability relates to the buildings infrastructure, followed by the
social factors which represent 33% of the total vulnerability equation.
The threat map was validated using landmarks and remains obtained as a
consequence of the flooding that occurred on February 15th 2015 in the
study area.

PD  - 
AB  - Rapid screening of flash flood-affected watersheds in Hungary. Flood
events in small mountain watersheds, called flash floods, have been
documented rather frequently over the past decades in many parts of the
world. Despite the country's relative flatness, floods of this type have
also been reported from the hilly and low mountain catchments of
Hungary. To avoid flash-flood-triggered losses, development of a flash
flood guidance (FFG) system was proposed by the concerned authorities.
To generate a rapid screening-based nationwide vulnerability map as part
of the FFG system, so-called passive environmental factors are
considered and discussed in the present study, i.e. those that change
insignificantly with time. These factors include topographical (slope
angle and slope range), land use and land cover (vegetation, soil
physical properties, topsoil thickness and limestone areas) and
hydrological factors (number of tributary rivers and stream density).
Vulnerability level is presented in two ways: (i) interpolation among
the outflow points of the individual watersheds (OFPI based) and (ii) on
the basis of individual watersheds (WSB type).
The obtained vulnerability maps largely differ from each other depending
on their way of representation, and the number of vulnerability classes.
The majority of the resulting maps appropriately reflect the most flash
flood-impacted areas of Hungary and indicate the areas for which flash
flood events have already been documented.

AB  - Over the past several decades, flash floods that occurred in Attica,
Greece, caused serious property and infrastructure damages, disruptions
in economic and social activities, and human fatalities. This paper
investigated the link between rainfall and flash flood impact during the
catastrophic event that affected Attica on 22 October 2015, while also
addressing human risk perception and behavior as a response to flash
floods. The methodology included the analysis of the space-time
correlation of rainfall with the citizens' calls to the emergency fire
services for help, and the statistical analysis of people's responses to
an online behavioral survey. The results designated critical rainfall
thresholds associated with flash flood impact in the four most affected
subareas of the Attica region. The impact magnitude was found to be
associated with the localized accumulated rainfall. Vulnerability
factors, namely, population density, geographical, and environmental
features, may have contributed to the differences in the impact
magnitudes between the examined subareas. The analysis of the survey's
behavioral responses provided insights into peoples' risk perception and
coping responses relative to the space-time distribution of rainfall.
The findings of this study were in agreement with the hypothesis that
the more severe the rainfall, the higher peoples' severity assessment
and the intensity of emotional response. Deeper feelings of fear and
worry were found to be related to more adjustments to the scheduled
activities and travels. Additionally, being alert to the upcoming
rainfall risk was found to be related to decreased worry and fear and to
fewer changes in scheduled activities.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - We investigated flooding patterns in the urbanised city-state of
Singapore through a multimethod approach combining station precipitation
data with archival newspaper and governmental records; changes in flash
floods frequencies or reported impacts of floods towards Singapore
society were documented. We subsequently discussed potential flooding
impacts in the context of urban vulnerability, based on future
urbanisation and forecasted precipitation projections for Singapore. We
find that, despite effective flood management, (i) significant increases
in reported flash flood frequency occurred in contemporary (post-2000)
relative to preceding (1984-1999) periods, (ii) these flash floods
coincide with more localised, ``patchy{''} storm events, (iii) storms in
recent years are also more intense and frequent, and (iv) floods result
in low human casualties but have high economic costs via insurance
damage claims. We assess that Singapore presently has low vulnerability
to floods vis-a-vis other regional cities largely due to holistic flood
management via consistent and successful infrastructural development,
widespread flood monitoring, and effective advisory platforms. We
conclude, however, that future vulnerabilities may increase from
stresses arising from physical exposure to climate change and from
demographic sensitivity via rapid population growth. Anticipating these
changes is potentially useful in maintaining the high resilience of
Singapore towards this hydrometeorological hazard.

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - Flash flood often causes serious losses in small catchments of China.
Nevertheless, the flash flood vulnerability assessment is relatively
limited in China. This paper presented a material flow assessment
framework to evaluate the flash flood vulnerability for small catchments
in Wuzhishan County of Hainan province, China. The framework was
developed into three parts: selection of typical villages and small
catchments, calculation of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity
with material flow analysis, and multiple evaluation of vulnerability
with the proposed material flow indices. In this framework, all material
flows of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity were measured by
water's mass. Then, the relationship between the three elements of
vulnerability was established through material flow indices. Results of
the three elements of vulnerability and four material flow indices in
each small catchment were exhibited via GIS. The evaluation results
suggested that catchments with lower exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
capacity did not necessarily lead to lower vulnerability, as the
inherent relationship among them might aggravate the vulnerability of
catchments to flash flood. Some suggestions were put forward for the
prevention of flash flood based on the vulnerability assessment.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the approach were
discussed.

PD  - 
AB  - The metropolitan area and the city of Genoa has become a national and
international case study for geohydrological risk, mainly due to the
frequency of floods. In 2014, there were landslides again, as well as
flash floods that have particularly caused casualties and economic
damage. The weather features of the Gulf of Genoa and the
geomorphological-environmental setting of the Ligurian coastal land are
the predisposing factors that determine heavy rains and their resulting
effects on the ground.
This study analysed the characteristics of the main meteorological
disasters that have hit Genoa since the start of the 20th century;
changes in the rainfall regime are evaluated and the main stages of
urbanization of the area are detailed, with the resulting changes to the
drainage network, in order to identify the main causes of this high
geohydrological risk. To this end, scientists have used climate data
recorded at the station of Genoa University, in operation since 1833,
and at Ponte Carrega station, located in the middle reach of the Bisagno
stream, a well-known watercourse because of its frequent floods. Urban
sprawl was evaluated through a multi-temporal mapping comparison, using
maps available from the beginning of the 19th century up to the current
regional technical maps. The average air temperature in Genoa shows a
statistically significant increase, while the number of rainy days
displays an equally clear decrease over time. The total annual rain
value does not seem to indicate rather noticeable changes. The intensity
of rain in Genoa expressed as rainfall rate, i.e. the ratio of annual
rainfall and number of rainy days, shows statistically significant
growth.
The geohydrological vulnerability in Genoa has increased over time due
to urban development which has established modifications in land use,
from agricultural to urban, especially in the valley floor. Waterways
have been confined and reduced to artificial channels, often covered in
their final stretch; in some cases they have even been totally removed.
These actions should be at least partially reversed in order to reduce
the presently high hydrological risk.

AB  - Climate is the major force that shapes the Earth. Under climate change
conditions, the extreme events shall occur more frequently with greater
force for devastation. In this study, Predicting Regional climate for
impact studies-Regional climate model (PRECIS RCM) was used to analyze
the trends in temperature and precipitation using climate indices for
the Kashmir valley, western Himalaya. We analyzed 27 climate extremity
indices using PRECIS RCM simulations for a baseline (1961-1990) and
future scenario (1990-2098) using RCLIMDEX model. Trend analysis was
carried out using Mann-Kendall test method and Theil-Sen estimator.
PRECIS RCM covers Kashmir valley in 14 grids of 50 km x 50 km horizontal
resolution each. The climatic grids for baseline data (1961-1990)
indicated no noteworthy patterns in hot and cold extreme indices.
However, climate grids for future simulations (1990-2098) showed an
increasing trend in all hot extreme events but no significant trend in
cold extremes. The futuristic frequency and intensity in the extreme
temperature events showed significant increase compared to extreme
precipitation events. The overall results indicated that grids
pertaining to valley plains shall have more extreme events in maximum
temperatures while as the grids towards the mountain fronts shall have
more extreme events in precipitation and minimum temperatures in the
future. The results establish a strong link between changing climate and
climatic extremes in the region. The study is finally aimed to use
PRECIS RCM simulations for impact assessment studies in the region.

AB  - In an attempt to conduct a back analysis of the damage caused to a 19th
century masonry structure due to the October 2009 flash flood/debris
flow event in Scaletta Zanclea, a flood discharge hydrograph is
reconstructed in the ungauged conditions. The hydrograph for the solid
discharge is then estimated by scaling up the liquid volume to the
estimated debris volume. The debris flow diffusion is simulated by
solving the differential equations for a single-phase two-dimensional
(2D) flow that employs triangular mesh elements, also taking into
account the channelling of the flow through the buildings. The damage to
the building is modelled using 2D finite shell elements and is based on
the maximum hydraulic action caused by the debris flow. The boundary
conditions provided by the openings, floor slabs, orthogonal wall panels
and the foundations are also modelled. The reconstruction of the event
and the damage to the case-study building confirm the location of the
damage induced by the event.

the exposure, sensitivity and coping capacities by affected agents. The
nexus between economic development and urban flooding is an essential
component of vulnerability. The literature revealed that as economic
development occurs, unplanned urbanization in absence of adequate
institutional mechanism was detrimental to frequent occurrences of
floods in urban centres. The causal factors, impacts, methodological
aspects are integrated which will provide a basis for designing flood

T1  - A Synthesized Vulnerability Assessment: Case Study of Biophysical and Social Vulnerability in Taitung County, Taiwan
A1  - Lee, Yung-Jaan
Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Strategies and action plans for reducing climate-related disaster risk
can be pursued through mitigation and adaptation. In the last ten years,
extreme climate events have severely caused flash floods, debris flows,
landslides, etc. and have damaged many sectors, including agriculture,
infrastructure and health. Since climate change is expected to have
continued effects on social functioning and human development, this
study proposes a vulnerability assessment framework combining both
biophysical and social vulnerability and further carries out synthesized
vulnerability analyses to identify vulnerable areas at the county level.
Because of its geographical, geological and climatic features, Taiwan is
susceptible to earthquakes, typhoons and numerous induced disasters. In
many areas of Taiwan, potential hazards include debris flows and flash
floods, but these problems are particularly severe in Taitung County.
Moreover, the impact of climate change will further cause severe damages
and disasters. Therefore, an urgent task for Taitung County is to
establish a vulnerability assessment framework as a policy tool to
identify not only the regions needing attention but also the hotspots in
which efforts could be made to reduce vulnerability. To analyze the
biophysical vulnerability of Taitung, this study examined hazards in
seven maps from Taiwan's National Science and Technology Center for
Disaster Reduction (NCDR) and made some adjustments according to local
characteristics. Statistical data from the NCDR regarding social
vulnerability were also used. Finally, GIS overlaying technique was used
to perform a synthesized analysis of biophysical vulnerability and
social vulnerability for each township.

T1  - Local perception of infrequent, extreme upland flash flooding: prisoners of experience?
A1  - Hopkins, Jonathan

Y1  - 2015///
PD  - 
AB  - The United Kingdom has experienced several exceptional summer flash
floods in recent years and there is growing concern about the frequency
of such events and the preparedness of the population. This paper uses a
case study of the upper Ryedale flash flood (2005) and questionnaire and
interview data to assess local perceptions of upland flash flooding.
Experience of a major flash flood may not be associated with increased
flood risk perception. Despite local residents' awareness of a trend
towards wetter summers and more frequent heavy rainfall, the poor
maintenance of rivers was more frequently thought to be a more
significant factor influencing local flood risk than climate change.
Such findings have important implications for the potential success of
contemporary national flood policies, which have put greater emphasis on
public responsibility for responding to flooding. This study recommends,
therefore, the use of fresh participatory approaches to redistribute and
raise awareness of locally-held flood knowledge.

PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods are natural hazards that may last only a few hours, but
their sudden onset often results in severe impacts on society and the
environment. Therefore, efforts to reduce flash flood-related losses
have primarily focused on the compilation of emergency operation plans
(EOPs). Conversely, there have been only a few attempts to provide
cartographic representations of EOPs in order to show the spatial
context of crisis operations. In the present map and its commentary, we
describe a pilot study of flash flood household labelling for use in
emergency operations carried out in Chrastava town, Northern Czechia.
Analyses of existing geographical databases, together with detailed
field surveys, have been performed to map relevant characteristics of
1110 buildings in terms of their location, function, number of residents
and degree of flood hazard, as well as the presence of flood-protection
measures. The map sheet is composed of the main map (overview of flood
extent and impacts) and three supplementary maps (technical and social
vulnerability of buildings), and the map key is designed to facilitate
strategic planning and directing of emergency operations in the study
area.

T1  - A geographical approach to post-flood analysis: The extreme flood event of 12 October 2007 in Calpe (Spain)
A1  - Martinez Ibarra, E
Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - The study demonstrates the importance, in general, of adopting a
geographical (integral) approach and local analysis to determine flood
risk in small Mediterranean basins, where normally there is no surface
runoff. At the same time, it highlights the possibilities afforded by a
post-flood study. More specifically, the study seeks to identify the
factors that aggravated the impact of the extreme flood event in the
tourist town of Calpe (Alicante, Spain) on 12 October 2007.
Our results stress the high volume of discharge that can be generated by
small basins in the Mediterranean following intense rainfall events that
may exceed 200 mm/day. For the 4.6 km(2) drainage network studied here,
we calculate a maximum discharge of 143 m(3)/s, for a return period of
500 years. This natural risk (high potential discharge in what are
usually dry basins) is exacerbated by the socioeconomic transformations
that have taken place along the Mediterranean coast. The expansion of
urban land use has increased vulnerability to flooding in highly
attractive tourist zones that are now at high risk of flooding. The
municipal area recognised as presenting a class ``2{''} qualitative
vulnerability (on a scale from 1 to 6, where 1 is the most vulnerable)
rose from 1% to 34% between 1956 and 2002. Changes to the basins and
the traditional drainage systems in endorheic zones have also increased
vulnerability to flood events. For example, the area occupied by the
mouth of the main basin analysed here has fallen from 2.4 ha in 1956 to
just 0.7 ha in 2002.
The study's main conclusions point to the need to introduce hydrological
monitoring networks in small drainage systems in ephemeral river basins.
It also stresses the importance of implementing structural actions to
facilitate surface runoff discharge. In the mid-to-long term we conclude
that there should be a declassification of urban land use zones at high
risk of flooding. Moreover, detailed (local) studies which adopt an
integral approach in their post-flood analyses should be undertaken to
identify levels of flood risk and the appropriate land use regulations
required. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

far. Moreover, current approaches in vulnerability research are driven
by a divide between social scientists who tend to view vulnerability as
representing a set of socio-economic factors, and natural scientists who
view vulnerability in terms of the degree of loss to an element at risk.
Further, vulnerability studies in response to flash flood processes are
rarely answered in the literature. In order to close this gap, this
paper implemented an integrated vulnerability approach focusing on
residential buildings exposed to flash floods in Greece. In general,
both physical and social vulnerability was comparable low, which is
interpreted as a result from (a) specific building regulations in Greece
as well as general design principles leading to less structural
susceptibility of elements at risk exposed, and (b) relatively low
economic losses leading to less social vulnerability of citizens
exposed. The population show high risk awareness and coping capacity to
response to natural hazards event and in the same time the impact of the
events are quite low, because of the already high use of local
protection measures. The low vulnerability score for East Attica can be
attributed especially to the low physical vulnerability and the moderate
socio-economic well-being of the area. The consequence is to focus risk
management strategies mainly in the reduction of the social
vulnerability. By analysing both physical and social vulnerability an
attempt was made to bridge the gap between scholars from sciences and
humanities, and to integrate the results of the analysis into the
broader vulnerability context. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

PD  - 
AB  - During the last decades, settlement activities increased in European
mountain regions. Due to the scarceness of areas suitable for
development, residential estates were extended into areas endangered by
natural hazards such as mass movements. These settlements generally show
a considerable vulnerability to tangible assets.
Integral risk management strategies to reduce the vulnerability to
tangible assets are presented for the assessment of such endangered
areas. Conventional mitigation and local structural measures are
discussed with respect to the necessary delimitation of endangered
areas, the preparedness of people and possible financial prevention.
According to different natural hazard processes (flash floods with and
without bedload transport, debris flows, land slides, rock falls and
avalanches) and various structural elements of buildings, a catalogue of
local structural measures is presented with respect to occurring process
impacts and protection objectives. Thereby, different local structural
measures are classified and recommended according to a possible
implementation for newly-erected buildings and for upgrading existing
buildings, respectively. Based on these recommendations, future needs
for a sustainable and comprehensive reduction of risk in settlement
areas endangered by mass movements are outlined. Above all, this
includes a prescription of building codes and the re-introduction of an
obligatory final inspection of buildings.

T1  - Multiscale modelling of rainstorm-induced historical intermediate floods (June-November) in the Rhone River Basin
A1  - Diodato, Nazzareno

Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - This study reveals the changes and evolution of rainstorm-driven
intermediate floods occurring and driving multiple damaging hydrological
events in the Rhone River Basin (RRB), since 1500 until 2010. A
parsimonious approach was developed to simulate the major
hydroclimatological flood-producing forcing, the Multiscale Rainstorm
Climate Model (STORMCLIMM). We collected the frequency of intermediate
floods-a type of particularly hazardous floods commonly taking place
between June and beginning of November-from the RCB to be compared to
STORMCLIMM estimates. The latter, smoothed by a moving window of 21
years, results in a high-pass filter in the time domain, which magnifies
the signal of forcing variations causing intermediate floods. The RRB
showed large temporal variations in both extreme rainstorms and
associated multidecadal intermediate-floods (MUDIF) frequency at
different climatic periods and land-use systems through historical
times. An important peak was observed in the Maunder Minimum (1645-1715
AD). The model allowed detecting MUDIF occurred in the historical times.
The situation becomes interesting with respect to recent times, because
the Rhone landscape looks more vulnerable in the last decades as a
consequence of land-use changes and climate shift towards more erratic
and intensive storms. This evidence suggests that the interactions of
land-use and climatic changes may turn into considerable vulnerability
to fluvial flooding and agro-ecosystem connected to them for upcoming
years. The Rhone, for example, provides basis for use of hydrological
indicators (such as the one represented by STORMCLIMM) for one site or
region and which, through minor modifications, can be made relevant to
specific needs.

AB  - Floods are frequent events in Mexico that often lead to economic losses.
Nonetheless, learning from these effects after such disasters that lead
to improved preparedness and community resilience is limited. This paper
analyzes the Magisterial community building resilience to flash floods.
Based on Liao theoretical approach about the key properties of
resilience, a survey was carried out based on household questionnaires
and expert interviews in the selected study area. The analysis of
building resilience community allowed the identification of strategies
used to cope with flash floods and identify the aspects that have
favored or inhibited the construction of resilience. In order to cope
with flash floods, the community has promoted strategies independent of
those carried out by the local government, but these do not have a
significant contribution to resilience. Based on the results, it is
established that the Magisterial community, although organized on its
own initiative and having made adjustments through the implementation of
strategies to cope with flash floods, is not a resilient community.
However, fundamental aspects for the construction of resilience have
been developed. A radical change in Mexico's flood risk management
paradigm is required to promote resilience at all governance and
decision-making levels.

Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - Flooding is the most common natural hazard in Greece, and most of
low-lying urban centers are flood-prone areas. Assessment of flood
hazard zones is a necessity for rational management of watersheds. In
this study, the coupling of the analytical hierarchy process and
geographical information systems were used, in order to assess flood
hazard, based either on natural or on anthropogenic factors. The
proposed method was applied on Kassandra Peninsula, in Northern Greece.
The morphometric and hydrographic characteristics of the watersheds were
calculated. Moreover, the natural flood genesis factors were examined,
and subsequently, the anthropogenic interventions within stream beds
were recorded. On the basis of the above elements, two flood hazard
indexes were defined, separately for natural and anthropogenic factors.
According to the results of these indexes, the watersheds of the study
area were grouped into hazard classes. At the majority of watersheds,
the derived hazard class was medium (according to the classification)
due to natural factors and very high due to anthropogenic. The results
were found to converge to historical data of flood events revealing the
realistic representation of hazard on the relating flood hazard maps.

Both flood events figure among the most significant events recorded in

the intensity and severity of the flood and spatial extension of the
damage. An analysis of historical sources allows the mapping of land use

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - The main objectives of this study were to understand the frequency of
forest fires, post-fire off-site hydrological response and erosional
processes from a social and ecological perspective in two basins located
in the central cordillera, Portugal. It also discusses the driving
forces that contribute towards increasing the social-ecological
vulnerability of systems in the face of hazards and emphasizes the
importance of learning from disasters. Based on the historical incidence
of wildfires, it is possible to identify several areas affected by two,
three or four fires, since 1975. Following the two major fires, in 1987
and 2005, flash floods, intense soil erosion and sedimentation processes
were generated, causing severe damage. Significant socioeconomic,
political and ecological changes have been affecting mountain regions in
the last decades. Approximately 80% of the population and more than
90% of the livestock have disappeared, common lands have been
afforested with Pinus pinaster, and several agricultural plots have been
abandoned. These factors have all contributed towards creating non-or
sub-managed landscapes that have led to a dramatic increase in the
magnitude and frequency of wildfires and to post-fire hydrological and
erosional processes when heavy rainfall occurs. Moreover, the low
population density, high level of population ageing and very fire-prone
vegetation that now covers large areas of both basins, contribute to a
situation of extreme socio-ecological vulnerability, meaning that
disasters will continue to occur unless resilience can be restored to
improve the capacity to cope with this high susceptibility to hazards.

AB  - Extreme rainfall events are the main triggering causes for
hydro-meteorological hazards in mountainous areas, where development is
often constrained by the limited space suitable for construction. In
these areas, hazard and risk assessments are fundamental for risk
mitigation, especially for preventive planning, risk communication and
emergency preparedness. Multi-hazard risk assessment in mountainous
areas at local and regional scales remain a major challenge because of
lack of data related to past events and causal factors, and the
interactions between different types of hazards. The lack of data leads
to a high level of uncertainty in the application of quantitative
methods for hazard and risk assessment. Therefore, a systematic approach
is required to combine these quantitative methods with expert-based
assumptions and decisions. In this study, a quantitative multi hazard
risk assessment was carried out in the Fella River valley, prone to
debris flows and flood in the northeastern Italian Alps. The main steps
include data collection and development of inventory maps, definition of
hazard scenarios, hazard assessment in terms of temporal and spatial
probability calculation and intensity modelling, elements-at-risk
mapping, estimation of asset values and the number of people, physical
vulnerability assessment, the generation of risk curves and annual risk
calculation. To compare the risk for each type of hazard, risk curves
were generated for debris flows, river floods and flash floods.
Uncertainties were expressed as minimum, average and maximum values of
temporal and spatial probability, replacement costs of assets,
population numbers, and physical vulnerability. These result in minimum,
average and maximum risk curves. To validate this approach, a back
analysis was conducted using the extreme hydro-meteorological event that
occurred in August 2003 in the Fella River valley. The results show a
good performance when compared to the historical damage reports. (C)

AB  - Vulnerability is a loss rate perceived from elements at risk owing to
the impact of hazards on determined magnitude and frequency.
Vulnerability assessment of elements at risk is a critical component in
the risk assessment framework. Considerable studies regarding flash
floods have been conducted, but the depth of information on
vulnerability is still limited. This study presents a model of the
physical vulnerability of buildings caused by the incidence of flash
floods, which is strengthened through intensity of the impact process
and loss. This model used a non-linear regression approach using
behavioural data in the form of the propagation height of the flood. The
order-2 polynomial distribution can represent the relationship between
the magnitudes of the best process and loss rate. The results are the
risk assessments of an exposed area in mitigation strategies.

PD  - 
AB  - Debris flows are natural processes that cause considerable economic loss
and sometimes also casualties. The motion of the debris flow is
influenced by both solid and fluid forces making it particularly
destructive. Although a large amount of studies regarding the process
itself is available in the literature, scientists repeatedly focused on
the physical vulnerability of the elements at risk since this is often
the key for the reduction of devastating consequences. In the present
paper, different approaches for the assessment of physical vulnerability
to debris flows are presented, discussed and highlighted through studies
from the literature. Their advantages and particular challenges are
outlined and studies following a similar approach (e.g. vulnerability
curves, vulnerability indicators) are presented and compared. Finally,
recommendations for the future are outlined including: (1) better damage
documentation for improved datasets, (2) improvement, combination and
expansion of existing methods (3) consideration of change for future
risk scenarios (4) further research on the interaction between elements
at risk and the hazard process including laboratory experiments and (5)
consideration of the resilience of buildings in the physical
vulnerability assessment.

Y1  - 2005///
PD  - 
AB  - Landslides in the city of La Paz, Bolivia are complex in space and time.
Their distribution within the city is differentiated by geographical
variations in slope gradient, the nature of overlying surface deposits,
and drainage density patterns. When mapped, the distribution of the most
landslide-prone locations in the city coincides with the most mobile
surface deposits on the higher and steeper slopes of the city. The
timing of landslides is triggered when slope materials become saturated
with moisture by rainfall, stream water, water seepage from high
surrounding water tables, and from domestic sources. Landslide
frequencies over the last 40 years show the role of inter-annual
variations in summer rainfalls, especially the late summer period
(Jan-Mar), and rising water tables connected to Lake Titicaca.
Associations with ENSO events, both warm (El Nino) and cold (La Nina),
prove negative, pointing to the importance of moisture sources from the
north, south and east (Amazon) but not from the west (Pacific). The most
vulnerable group exposed to the landslide hazard comprise the
inhabitants of the self-built informal housing areas who occupy the more
elevated steeper slopes of the northern part of the city. But societal
vulnerability to earth movement in the city is widespread and
interconnected. Higher income groups in the southern part of the city
are affected by slower, if less dramatic, forms of land failure, and
rich housing in downstream areas of the city are impacted by flash
flooding encouraged by deforestation on the northern hill slopes where
the poor live. Two case studies highlight the vulnerability and plight
of the inhabitants of the self-built settlements in the aftermath of a
major landslide, and a brief discussion of hazard mitigation and the
importance of building hazard resilient communities concludes the paper.

PD  - 
AB  - Flood is a normal ecosystem phenomenon and a natural hydrological
feature of most river systems. Climate variability may also bring about
precipitation events that cause floods. However, recent floods in most
areas may be anthropogenically induced and are on a spatial and temporal
increase. This study assessed rainfall variability, flooding and the
adaptations of slum residents to floods in Kumasi, Ghana. Rainfall data
of Kumasi were collected from the Meteorological Services Department,
Accra. Basic descriptive statistics of rainfall data were used to
evaluate the rainfall variability. The Mann-Kendall test was used to
assess rainfall trends. A survey of residents of flood-prone suburbs was
conducted to assess their vulnerability and adaptations to floods. The
results show that rainfall in March and November is significantly
decreasing. The floods in Kumasi are not due to climate change but bad
spatial development practices. Most people will pump out water and build
embankments around their houses as adaptations to the floods. Flooding
in Kumasi will continue to outwit local government initiatives of storm
drain construction because the floods are predominantly due to
development of effluent streams and less from flash floods.

AB  - Globally, a number of catastrophic hydrometeorological hazards occurred
in 2017 among which the monsoon floods in South Asia was particularly
disastrous, killing nearly 1200 people in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.
The wetland region (Haor) of northeastern (NE) Bangladesh was severely
affected by flash floods early in 2017, affecting nearly 1 million
households and damaging US $ 450 million worth of rice crops. This
study investigates how the NE Bangladesh experienced the 2017 flash
floods, and to what degree the wetland communities are vulnerable and
resilience to flash floods. Focus group discussion, key informant
interviews, and household questionnaire surveys (n=80) were applied in
the study area of Sunamganj district. Results from statistical analyses
and regression modelling reveal that poor people are particularly
vulnerable to floods but they are also more adaptive and thus resilient;
middle-income households are vulnerable as they are hesitant to take up
any jobs and accept flood relief; and rich households, despite being
less adaptive, are able to recover from flood disasters because of
wealth. This study reveals that resilience also stems from deep
religious faith in the Haor inhabitants that supports communities to
move on by accepting that most natural calamities such as flash floods
are divine tests. This study also finds that women are particularly
vulnerable and less resilient as they are not normally allowed to work
outside of their homes and beyond the Haor communities due to cultural
and religious reasons.

T1  - Can Strategies to Cope with Hazard Shocks be Explained by At-Risk Households' Socioeconomic Asset Profile? Evidence from Tropical Cyclone-Prone Coastal Bangladesh
A1  - Ahsan, Md. Nasif
Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - This article documents the results of an empirical investigation on the
complex interplay between diverse coping mechanisms and the
socioeconomic asset profiles of coastal households at risk. Focusing on
household-level perceptions and responses to cyclone hazards, a case
study was carried out in a poor area in Bangladesh that is prone to
natural hazards. We developed and tested our own analytical models based
on the asset approach. We conducted a face-to-face household survey in
southwestern coastal Bangladesh, in the Koyra sub-district, in late
2009. We asked 360 households affected by the May 2009 tropical Cyclone
Aila about their hazard perceptions, preparedness, coping practices, and
socioeconomic assets. The results suggest that the majority of
households at risk perceive an increasing trend of different climate
hazards, with a distinct dominance of tropical cyclones, storm surges,
and flash floods in the study area, which resulted in a yearly average
economic damage of USD 144 for each household in the first year after
Aila. However, such damage is significantly and inversely correlated
with the number of adopted coping practices. Significant and systematic
differences exist between upstream and downstream households in the
study area with respect to hazard perception, hazard induced damages,
asset accessibility, and adopted diversified coping practices. The
empirical findings suggest that the degree of adoption of coping
practices depends primarily on elements of socioeconomic asset profile
and the duration of the consequences of cyclone hazards. Disaster
preparedness training seems to improve at-risk households' degree of
information access and eventually leads them to adopt more coping
practices to reduce adverse impacts of climate hazards. Area-specific
practical modules on coping practices should be incorporated in
curricula of disaster preparedness training to make people at risk more
resilient to hazard shocks.

AB  - Six years after the devastating M-s 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake, new
landslides, debris flows, and flash floods still occur frequently in the
earthquake-stricken regions. This shows that the geological hazards that
occur after a major earthquake in a mountainous environment can be a
long-term threat. However, post-earthquake reconstruction and relocation
of local residents often neglect this evolving threat, and its
interaction with existing and rebuilt houses has not been well studied.
Here we show that the evolving mountain environment, including the
changed geographic distribution of new landslides and the continuously
uplifting riverbed, creates emerging risks for existing and rebuilt
houses. We use spatial analysis of landslide debris and the location of
houses from high-resolution images and field survey in the study area
and find that new landslides and the houses rebuilt after the Wenchuan
earthquake have a similar trend of moving to lower elevations, gentler
slopes, and closer to rivers. This study confirms that the persistent
downward movement of landslide debris has rapidly filled up riverbeds
over the past 6 years. The elevated riverbeds make the study area
extremely susceptible to flash floods, creating further risks to newly
rebuilt houses that are closer to the river. We highlight the often
neglected dynamic process that involves changes in the natural

dynamic process requires long-term monitoring and adaptive management of
mountainous regions after major earthquakes that can fully consider the
so-phisticated evolving risks caused by the changing environment,
exposure, and vulnerability in the region.

AB  - Urban flooding is a gradually increasing problem as the urban population
expands into floodplains. In urban environments, flood vulnerability is
significantly increased as a more concentrated population and assets
makes flooding costly and challenging, in terms of impact estimation.
This work focuses on mapping and classifying impacts after the
catastrophic 2014 flood in Athens, Greece. The study proposes a method
for classifying flood effects into four categories including: the
natural and built environment, mobile objects and human population,
organized in five classes of increasing severity, i.e. minor, weak,
moderate, strong and extreme. Flood effects are grouped based on the
qualitative nature of the recorded effects, allowing the development of
an impact-severity map. Mapping of the 2014 flood effects indicated
specific locations where the severity of impacts was distinctively
higher than others, providing a holistic overview of the flood's effects
and highlighting the usefulness of the approach in future flood
protection planning.

AB  - This work defines a national flood susceptibility index for the
Portuguese continental territory, by proposing the aggregation of
different variables which represent natural conditions for permeability,
runoff and accumulation. This index is part of the national
vulnerability index developed in the scope of Flood Maps in Climate
Change Scenarios (CIRAC) project, supported by the Portuguese
Association of Insurers (APS).
This approach expands on previous works by trying to bridge the gap
between different flood mechanisms (e.g. progressive and flash floods)
occurring at different spatial scales in the Portuguese territory
through (a) selecting homogeneously processed data sets and (b)
aggregating their values to better translate the spatially continuous
and cumulative influence in floods at multiple spatial scales.
Results show a good ability to capture, in the higher susceptibility
classes, different flood types: fluvial floods and flash floods. Lower
values are usually related to mountainous areas, low water accumulation
potential and more permeable soils. Validation with independent flood
data sets confirmed these index characteristics, although some
overestimation can be seen in the southern region of Alentejo where, due
to a dense hydrographic network and an overall low slope, floods are not
as frequent as a result of lower precipitation mean values.
Future work will focus on (i) including extreme precipitation data sets
to represent the triggering factor, (ii) improving representation of
smaller and stepper basins, (iii) optimizing variable weight definition
process and (iii) developing more robust independent flood validation
data sets.

AB  - <p><strong>Abstract.</strong> This study aims to develop a new procedure that combines multi-criteria spatial vulnerability analysis with the traditional linear probabilistic risk approach. This approach is named integrated fuzzy flood vulnerability assessment because it combines the watershed-based vulnerability framework with stream-based risk analysis. The Delphi technique and pressure-state-impact-response framework are introduced to objectively select evaluation criteria, and the fuzzy TOPSIS technique is proposed to address the uncertainty of weights to all criteria and crisp input data of all spatial units. ArcGIS is used to represent the spatial results to all criteria. This framework is applied to the south Han River basin in South Korea. As a result, the flood vulnerability ranking was derived and vulnerability characteristics of all spatial units were compared. This framework can be used to conduct a prefeasibility study for flood mitigation projects when various stakeholders should be included.</p>

AB  - The main objective of the present study was to provide a novel methodological approach for flash flood susceptibility modeling based on a feature selection method (FSM) and tree based ensemble methods. The FSM, used a fuzzy rule based algorithm FURIA, as attribute evaluator, whereas GA were used as the search method, in order to obtain optimal set of variables used in flood susceptibility modeling assessments. The novel FURIA-GA was combined with LogitBoost, Bagging and AdaBoost ensemble algorithms. The performance of the developed methodology was evaluated at the Bao Yen district and the Bac Ha district of Lao Cai Province in the Northeast region of Vietnam. For the case study, 654 floods and twelve geo-environmental variables were used. The predictive performance of each model was estimated through the calculation of the classification accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity, the success and predictive rate curve and the area under the curves (AUC). The FURIA-GA FSM compared to a conventional rule based method gave more accurate predictive results. Also, the FURIA-GA based models, presented higher learning and predictive ability compared to the ensemble models that had not undergone a FSM. Based on the predictive classification accuracy, FURIA-GA-Bagging (93.37%) outperformed FURIA-GA-LogitBoost (92.35%) and FURIA-GA-AdaBoost (89.03%). FURIA-GA-Bagging showed also the highest sensitivity (96.94%) and specificity (89.80%). On the other hand, the FURIA-GA-LogitBoost showed the lowest percentage in very high susceptible zone and the highest relative flash-flood density, whereas the FURIA-GA-AdaBoost achieved the highest prediction AUC value (0.9740), based on the prediction rate curve, followed by FURIA-GA-Bagging (0.9566), and FURIA-GA-LogitBoost (0.8955). It can be concluded that the usage of different statistical metrics, provides different outcomes concerning the best prediction model, which mainly could be attributed to sites specific settings. The proposed models could be considered as a novel alternative investigation tools appropriate for flash flood susceptibility mapping.

PD  - 
AB  - Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes
affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have
consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the
type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability
conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of
landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and
landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal
scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on
landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and
find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the
world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in
Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the
approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on
landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods
that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in
temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct
and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a
probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide
changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of
landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the
Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate
variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope
processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based
on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from
worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and
risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide
projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and
the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future
landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of
climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming
is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall
events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many
landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people
exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for
landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a
warming climate. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

AB  - Post-event survey and investigation is one way to gain experience on
natural hazards. The importance of the systematisation and
standardisation of such investigations and re-analysis is progressively
recognised in all the geophysical sciences as shown by the growing
number of scientific papers and programs on the subject. But how to
proceed in the case of a flash floods, what type of data should be
collected for what type of analyses and to explore which particular
issues? To give a first answer to these questions, a methodology for
post-flash flood field investigations has been developed under the EC
FLOODsite project and tested under the EC HYDRATE project. This paper
presents shortly the principles of this methodology and illustrates its
application for the study of two major flash floods that occurred in
November 1999 and September 2002 in the South of France.

flash floods in many areas during recent years motivate us to study
long-term changes in extreme rainfall over India. The analysis of the
frequency of rainy days, rain days and heavy rainfall days as well as
one-day extreme rainfall and return period has been carried out in this
study to observe the impact of climate change on extreme rainfall events
and flood risk in India. The frequency of heavy rainfall events are
decreasing in major parts of central and north India while they are
increasing in peninsular, east and north east India. The study tries to
bring out some of the interesting findings which are very useful for
hydrological planning and disaster managements. Extreme rainfall and
flood risk are increasing significantly in the country except some parts
of central India.

AB  - The management of flash flood hazards and risks is a critical component
of public safety and quality of life. Flash-floods develop at space and
time scales that conventional observation systems are not able to
monitor for rainfall and river discharge. Consequently, the atmospheric
and hydrological generating mechanisms of flash-floods are poorly
understood, leading to highly uncertain forecasts of these events. The
objective of the HYDRATE project has been to improve the scientific
basis of flash flood forecasting by advancing and harmonising a
European-wide innovative flash flood observation strategy and developing
a coherent set of technologies and tools for effective early warning
systems. To this end, the project included actions on the organization
of the existing flash flood data patrimony across Europe. The final aim
of HYDRATE was to enhance the capability of flash flood forecasting in
ungauged basins by exploiting the extended availability of flash flood
data and the improved process understanding. This paper provides a
review of the work conducted in HYDRATE with a special emphasis on how
this body of research can contribute to guide the policy-life cycle
concerning flash flood risk management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods may occur suddenly and be accompanied by other hazards such
as landslides, mud flows, damage to infrastructure and even death. In
the UK such events are comparatively rare occurring on average only once
or twice per year. Warning systems must depend upon the accurate
real-time provision of rainfall information, high-resolution numerical
weather forecasts and the operation of hydrological model systems in
addition to forecast delivery procedures not discussed in this paper. In
this paper we review how flash floods are forecast considering the
limitations and uncertainty involved in both the meteorological and
hydrological aspects of forecasting systems. Data assimilation and the
use of ensembles are both key elements across disciplines. Assessing the
susceptibility of river catchments to extreme flooding is considered,
and statistical methods of estimating the likelihood of extreme rainfall
and floods within a changing climate are examined. Ways of constraining
flash flood forecasts are noted as one way to improve forecast
performance in the future. Copyright (c) 2007 Royal Meteorological

AB  - Flash floods and debris flows develop at space and time scales that
conventional observation systems for rainfall, streamflow and sediment
discharge are not able to monitor. Consequently, the atmospheric,
hydrological and geomorphic controls on these hydrogeomorphic processes
are poorly understood, leading to highly uncertain warning and risk
management. On the other hand, remote sensing of precipitation and
numerical weather predictions have become the basis of several flood
forecasting systems, enabling increasingly accurate detection of
hazardous events. The objective of this paper is to provide a review on
current European and international research on early warning systems for
flash floods and debris flows. We expand upon these themes by
identifying: (a) the state of the art; (b) knowledge gaps; and (c)
suggested research directions to advance warning capabilities for
extreme hydrogeomorphic processes. We also suggest three areas in which
advancements in science will have immediate and important practical
consequence, namely development of rainfall estimation and nowcasting
schemes suited to the specific space-time scales, consolidating
physical, engineering and social datasets of flash floods and
debris-flows, integration of methods for multiple hydrogeomorphic hazard

AB  - High-resolution data enabling identification and analysis of the
hydrometeorological causative processes of flash floods have been
collected and analysed for 25 extreme flash floods (60 drainage basins
ranging in area from 95 to 1856 km(2)) across Europe Most of the
selected floods are located in a geographical belt crossing Europe from
western Mediterranean (Catalunia and southwestern France) to Black Sea
covering northern Italy Slovenia Austria Slovakia and Romania Criteria
for flood selection were high intensity of triggering rainfall and flood
response and availability of high-resolution reliable data
Hydrometeorological data collected and collated for each event were
checked by using a hydrological model The derivation and analysis of
summarising variables based on the data archive has made it possible to
outline some characteristics of flash floods in various morphoclimatic
regions of Europe Peak discharge data for more than 50% of the studied
watersheds derive from post-flood surveys in ungauged streams This
stresses both the significance of post flood surveys in building and
extending flash flood data bases and the need to develop new methods for
flash flood hazard assessment able to take Into account data from
post-event analysis Examination of data shows a peculiar seasonality
effect on flash flood occurrence with events in the Mediterranean and
Alpine-Mediterranean regions mostly occurring in autumn whereas events
in the inland Continental region commonly occur in summer revealing
different climatic forcing Consistently with this seasonality effect
spatial extent and duration of the events is generally smaller for the
Continental events with respect to those occurring in the Mediterranean
region Furthermore the flash flood regime is generally more intense in
the Mediterranean Region than in the Continental areas The runoff
coefficients of the studied flash floods are usually rather low (mean
value 0 35) Moderate differences in runoff coefficient are observed
between the studied climatic regions with higher values in the
Mediterranean region Antecedent saturation conditions have a significant
impact on event runoff coefficients showing the influence of initial
soil moisture status even on extreme flash flood events and stressing
the importance of accounting soil moisture for operational flash flood
forecasting The runoff response displays short lag times (mostly <6 h)
The identified relations between watershed area stream length and
response time enable determination of a characteristic mean velocity of
the flash flood process (at basin scales less than 350 km(2)) defined as
the ratio of characteristic length (mean river length) and time
(response time or lag time) equal to 3 m s(-1) This is related to the
celerity with which the flood wave moves through the catchment The
analysis of the response time provides information on the time
resolution and the spatial density of the networks required for
monitoring the storms that generate flash floods (C) 2010 Elsevier B V

AB  - A holistic perspective on changing rainfall-driven flood risk is
provided for the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Economic losses
from floods have greatly increased, principally driven by the expanding
exposure of assets at risk. It has not been possible to attribute
rain-generated peak streamflow trends to anthropogenic climate change
over the past several decades. Projected increases in the frequency and
intensity of heavy rainfall, based on climate models, should contribute
to increases in precipitation-generated local flooding (e.g. flash
flooding and urban flooding). This article assesses the literature
included in the IPCC SREX report and new literature published since, and
includes an assessment of changes in flood risk in seven of the regions
considered in the recent IPCC SREX report-Africa, Asia, Central and
South America, Europe, North America, Oceania and Polar regions. Also
considering newer publications, this article is consistent with the
recent IPCC SREX assessment finding that the impacts of climate change
on flood characteristics are highly sensitive to the detailed nature of
those changes and that presently we have only low confidence(1) in
numerical projections of changes in flood magnitude or frequency
resulting from climate change.

AB  - Every year floods cause enormous damage all over the world. This study
investigates loss of human life statistics for different types of floods
and different regions on a global scale. The OFDA/CRED Database contains
data on international disasters and is maintained by the Centre for
Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels (CRED) in
cooperation with United States Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance
(OFDA). Information from this source on a large number of flood events,
which occurred between January 1975 and June 2002, is evaluated with
respect to flood location and flood type. Due to the limited
availability of information on coastal flood events, the scope of this
study is limited to three types of freshwater flooding; river floods,
flash floods and drainage problems. First, the development of loss of
life statistics over time is discussed. Second, the dataset is analysed
by region, by flood type and by the combination of type and region. The
study shows that flash floods result in the highest average mortality
per event (the number of fatalities divided by the number of affected
persons). A cross analysis by flood type and location shows that average
mortality is relatively constant for the different types over various
continents, while the magnitude of the impacts (numbers of killed) and
affected for a certain type varies between the different continents. On
a worldwide scale Asian river floods are most significant in terms of
number of persons killed and affected. Finally, a comparison with
figures for other types of natural disasters shows that floods are the
most significant disaster type in terms of the number of persons
affected.

AB  - Flash floods are one of the most significant natural hazards in Europe,
causing serious risk to life and destruction of buildings and
infrastructure. This type of flood, often affecting ungauged watersheds,
remains nevertheless a poorly documented phenomenon. To address the gap
in available information, and particularly to assess the possible ranges
for peak discharges on watersheds with area smaller than 500 km(2) and
to describe the geography of the hazard across Europe, an intensive data
compilation has been carried out for seven European hydrometeorological
regions. This inventory is the first step towards an atlas of extreme
flash floods in Europe. It contains over 550 documented events. This
paper aims at presenting the data compilation strategy, the content of
the elaborated data base and some preliminary data analysis results. The
initial observations show that the most extreme flash floods are greater
in magnitude in the Mediterranean countries than in the inner
continental countries and that there is a strong seasonality to flash
flood occurrence revealing different climatic forcing mechanisms in each
region. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study describes the investigation conducted for flood risk
assessment in urban areas using SIR-C data. The Athens basin is a
densely populated area with approximately four million inhabitants,
affected very often by destructive flash-floods. These flood phenomena
occur mainly at the margins of the urban area very close to the
surrounding mountains. The SIR-C image, acquired on October 2nd, 1994,
has been processed for speckle reduction and additionally a non-linear
stretching has been applied. After the first observations at every
single image, a false colour composite image was created using L-band
HV, C-band HH, and L-band HH as R,G,B. The captured information concerns
morphology (topography, slopes, gullies), land use and land cover,
drainage characteristics and building shell extension, density and block
orientation.

AB  - Natural geological hazards such as flash floods, landslides, debris
flows and mudflows have caused, and will continue to cause, many
problems in Malawi. Landslide risks are primarily a geological problem
and it is Quaternary geology that concerns our environment most. It is a
typical geological task to reconstruct the old events using geological,
geomorphological and dating methods and based on these results, predict
possible future disasters. Our studies of old and recent debris flow
events in Southern Malawi have found out that these phenomena are mainly
triggered by tropical cyclones that bring heavy rainfalls. They occur in
mountain slopes with certain slope instability, soil cover and
discontinuity patterns of the underlying rocks. Human impacts on the
environment such as large scale earthworks projects and replacement of
natural forests by non endemic tree species have also played an
important role in a rising risk of flash floods and debris flows, It is
recommended that the most sustainable method of mitigation against these
hazards is to incorporate the geological hazard zoning maps into town
and regional planning schemes. Where this may not be possible, measures
that can reduce or minimise the hazard impact should be adopted.
Zomba Mountain is made of a Mesozoic syenite pluton that intruded
Precambrian high-grade metamorphic gneisses and granulites. Weathering
erosion and uplift have left the syenite standing at an elevation of
2000 meters while the surrounding area is between 700 and 1000 meters
above sea level. Zomba town is located at the foot of the mountain.
Steep slopes with up to 50degrees, the highly jointed syenite, and the
thick lateritic soil covers are the main factors likely to influence
rock, instability, Debris flows triggered by heavy rainfall have
affected Zomba since memorial times. People of Zomba and the authorities
are well aware of past landslides and the continued risk. As a result
from our investigations the detailed risk zoning of Zomba contributes to
the disaster preparedness plan of the town.

PD  - 
AB  - In October 1998, (Hurricane Mitch) the water level of Lake Managua
(Nicaragua) rose about 4 m. The water level is still so high that there
is evident risk of a serious flash flood. There was a need for forecasts
of the water level. There were no telemetric hydrological data
available. So the only possibility was to use precipitation data from
meteorological stations and water level observations. Three different
forecasts were developed: a monthly forecast for the rainy season, a
monthly forecast for the dry season and a flash flood forecast. It was
found that three daily reporting meteorological stations were enough for
the flash flood forecast. The flash flood model has been tested using
observations during Hurricane Mitch. Correlation coefficients of the
water level forecasts in the model and observed water levels were r =
0.99 for the 1-day forecast and r = 0.98 for the 2-day forecast.

PD  - 
AB  - The Gulf Coastal states region of United States is prone to the highest
national frequency of both severe weather and climate problems
accompanied by economic losses (e.g., severe convection, flooding,
tropical cyclones, ice storms etc.,). A GIS/Remote Sensing framework is
necessary to properly understand physical processes, investigate cause
and affect relationships and develop conceptual models of the behavior
of environmental systems. Our goals included focusing on the
environmental effects and impacts of heavy rains and flash flooding and
finally to produce a prototype GIS/RS Environmental Risk Assessment
System (ERAISA) for the region of interest. We selected ``The historic
Southeast Louisiana and Southern Mississippi flood activity during May
8-10th, 1995{''} as our study case. The NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale model
(MM5) is used to study the effects of warm sea surface temperature
anomalies, sea surface pressure and winds on the precipitation
characteristics of this event. Mesoscale model simulations are used to
forecast and better understand the physics associated with the flood
event. Each component is modified to accommodate the detailed study. For
the preliminary model run, a doubly nested domain centered over the
Central Gulf of Mexico with grid spacing of 90 km and 30 km is employed.
MM5 is run for each 6 hr period, from the initial storm development -
May 8(th) and through May 10(th). NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and synoptic
data are used for constructing the initial and boundary conditions. The
model simulations are compared with Radar data for further comparisons
and validations. The phenomenon of interest - flooding here is narrowly
defined in order to depict, analyze and predict (or manage)
environmental dynamics through the use and application of GIS and Remote
Sensing (RS) data and technologies. A major goal is to unify our
understanding and knowledge of similar historic events into a more
comprehensive integrative framework from different disciplines -
meteorology, marine and fisheries sciences, environmental sciences etc.,
and develop a system of Integrated Environmental Risk Assessment for the
Gulf Coast, which would be ultimately used for operational use.

AB  - AVS in collaboration with Linkoping University are developing a Visual
User Interface and Web-enabled advanced 3D visualization to a flood
forecasting system in an EC funded project named MUSIC. The project
develops state-of-the-art precipitation estimation algorithms, assess
their uncertainty and use an innovative combination of the output data
of the three independent data sources radar, satellite and rain gauges.
The basic role of any real-time quantitative precipitation and flood
forecasting system lies in its capability, within the forecasting
horizon, of assessing and reducing the uncertainty in forecasts of
future events in order to allow improved warnings and operational
decisions for the reduction of flood risk. In line with this
requirement, the MUSIC project is to develop an innovative technique for
improving the weather radar, weather satellite and rain gauge derived
precipitation data, taken as independent measurement source. Another key
objective is seeking to improve the communication and the dissemination
of results to the authorities involved in real-time flood forecasting
and management. The project tests the system on real world case studies
on two test catchments the Reno and Arno rivers in Italy. AVS and LiU
are developing the innovative 3D Visual User Interface that will enable
the users to take a more active role in the process of visualising and
investigating flood forecasting, allowing them to better understand the
data and uncertainty behind the forecasting system. LiU also provides
easy-to-use collaborative visualization tools enabling the
meteorologists, hydrologists, operations managers and the civil defence
manager to view and discuss the forecasting results in real time across
the network before finally interacting with the media, the police, other
officials and the public. The system will considerably improve the flash
flood forecasting reliability and precision and will shorten the time
required to detect events that lead to catastrophic flood events.

Y1  - 2004///
PD  - 
AB  - In the past decades, many urban areas around the world have been
experiencing a dramatic increase in disaster due to flood. Flood is one
of the extreme hydrological events which has been a major concern since
the dawn of human civilization. Especially the flash flood, it can cause
the greatest number of deaths and the greatest damage in a sudden. The
impact of flood on people's livelihood may be much longer than the water
take to recede. The effect of lost and degraded assets can also have
very much long-term impact on society and ecosystems. It is obvious that
flood incident has become the limiting factor to economic and social
development. Therefore, various efforts have been set out for
establishment of the proper prevention and mitigation to reach
sustainable level to relief flood stress in such a way that avoid the
past mistakes and satisfy the widest range of needs and maintain the
natural ecosystem (Budhakooncharoen, S., 2001). The current situation to
cope with this type of water related extreme event is diversified into
four levels, namely disaster preparedness, prevention and mitigation,
emergency response and disaster recovery. Among promising response
strategies, the role of forecast and warning system is widely taken into
consideration in several research studies to contribute to the
systematic preparedness of urban flood management. This calls for a
sequence of several steps (Todini, E., 2000), namely establishing an
effective monitoring to detect all possible formation of storm through
meteorological conditions and hydrological process which may lead to the
extreme event. Future river flow condition and water stage are
forecasted on the place, time, magnitude, areal extension, duration and
time span of crisis based mathematical modeling including
meteorological, hydrological and hydraulic models (Bronstert, A., 2002).
Warning is sent to the appropriate authorities and to the public. The
population at risk and the authorities responsible for the defense
responds to the warning. Finally, assistance during and after the
disaster hit is taken place, eg. provision of food, drinking water,
shelter and medical care including reconstruction of infrastructure,
rehabilitation of the environment and of the defense system. The
challenge lies in the improvement of meteorological model to assess in
detail the location and the magnitude of rainfall especially the local
convective heavy thunderstorm that may cause flash flood. Then, the
hydrological model plays an important role to simulate the
transformation of rainfall into run-off as part of a real time flood
prediction system. Hydraulic model provides details of flow and stage
for different locations and times of flood wave propagation. Improvement
and coupling of all modeling system will allow for increased early
warning lead-times to alleviate flood damage. To contribute in this
research study to the early step of real time flood forecast, it has led
to the option using remote sensing data to estimate the rainfall in a
pilot study area. This article presents the investigation of the
relation between rainfall measured by the synoptic stations and that
forecasted from the meteorological satellite image taken by Japan's
Geostationary Meteorological Satellite, GMS-5. The north basin of Pasak
River in central Thailand was the area selected for this study.
The observed rainfall from the synoptic stations located at Muang,
Lomsak and Wichianburi Districts, Petchabun Province during wet season
(May to October) of the years 1997 and 1998 were analyzed to find out
the relations to the clou top temperature taken from the meteorological
satellite image during the same period of time. As the results, the
relation between rainfall and cloud top temperature could be revealed by
the equations : P = 2.52 x 10(28) T-p(-11.411), P = 7.57 x 10(24)
T-P(-9.555) and P = 1.796 x 10(26) T-p(-10.525) with the correlation
coefficient (R-2) of 0.7527, 0.6829 and 0.8149 for rain gauge stations
at the districts of Muang, Lomsak and Wichianburi respectively, where P
is the value of rainfall in millimeter and T-p is the value of the cloud
top temperature in degree Kelvin. Then, the empirical equations were
used to estimate the rainfall during the wet season of the years 1999
and 2000 in comparison with the actual rainfall measured from the
corresponding synoptic stations during the same period of time. Such
comparison gave the correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.8249, 0.6591 and
0.8411 respectively. This result revealed that the estimated rainfall
gave an acceptable relation with the values of actually measured at the
same period of time. The result of this rainfall estimate is expected to
challenge the further study to transform the estimated values of
rainfall into the flood hydrograph using appropriate rainfall-runoff
model. It can be conclude that this initiation is therefore,
alternatively served as an initial challenge for further development of
real time flood forecast using more sufficient and appropriate
meteorological data from satellite imagery or other types of remote
sensing observation.

AB  - The city of Naga is a medium sized city on the isle of Luzon in the
Philippines. It is located in an area that is frequently bit by typhoons
that cause severe inundations of the city and the surrounding
agricultural lands. Several types of floods affect the area, sometimes
in combination: a) riverine floods from the Bicol, the main river in the
area, b) flash-floods from the torrent Naga, and c) storm surges from
the sea. In close collaboration with the municipality of Naga, a
research program was initiated to investigate to what extend
hydrodynamic modelling can be used as an instrument to: a) assess the
flood hazard situation in terms of inundation probability and b) to make
a risk assessment based on the flood hazard and the elements at risk.
This paper presents the first results of flood inundation modelling. In
the future the city intends to use these models as simulation tools to
support decision-making in designing mitigation measures and to assess
the suitability of potential urban expansion sites.

AB  - One-third of the Earth's surface can currently be classified as and or
semiarid. This fraction may increase in the future for example due to
global warming effects. Many and and semiarid regions are particularly
affected by flash floods, caused mainly by convective storm systems, and
often resulting in significant damages to property and even loss of
life. The short duration and the small geographic extent of these events
make predicting the subsequent floods extremely difficult. To improve
our predictive capability, we are currently developing a semiarid
specific model based on the well-established event-based rainfall-runoff
model KINEROS2, capable of continuously simulating the response of a
specific basin and driven by high-resolution precipitation measurements.
This spatially distributed kinematic wave model represents the basin as
a cascade of planes and channels. The dynamic infiltration algorithm is
particularly well suited for simulation of semiarid hydrological
processes. Adjustments to the original model include restructuring the
code in a modular fashion, adding long-term soil moisture storage and
evapotranspiration algorithms, and including optimization tools for
parameter estimation. The project aims towards more accurate, reliable
and probabilistic flood warnings, for semiarid flash-flood forecasting,
risk assessment and decision making. This paper outlines the model and
some associated data processing tools, and represents some initial
results of applying the model to a small semiarid basin in the
Southwestern USA.

Floods and other seemingly weather related natural disasters have been increasing not only by reported damage but also by frequency and intensity (www.munichre.com). As global climate models predict a clear increase in temperature and weather extremes (IPCC 2001) due to increase in the atmospheric concentration of green house gases (GHG) it is obvious to relate the reported increase in flood risk to climate change. However, extreme precipitation is neither correctly modelled in existing global models nor correctly covered in existing statistical analysis of the past due to its inherent variability in space and time. This is specially true for the data base of future risk analysis as along with the spatial extend of typical flood prone catchments the need for regional and local estimates of extreme precipitation is increasingly important. New methods as well as new combinations of existing methods are required to address climate change related flood risk on the regional level.;

T1  - Flash flooding in Spain: geomorphological approaches supporting flood frequency analysis, and the implications for the design of structures
A1  - Lopez-Aviles, Alma
Y1  - 2007///
PD  - 
AB  - Conventional methods for the estimation of flood frequency are generally
based on the statistical analysis of data series resulting from the
measurement of water levels at specific locations, which are translated
into discharges (m(3)/s) using standard stage/discharge relationships.
Subsequently, these gauged flows are used to identify the largest flood
event experienced by a river or catchment, and to produce growth curves
used in the estimation of the return periods of specific flood events,
as well as in the calculation of discharges for specific required design
events (e.g. return period 1 in 100 year). In areas where gauging data
records are scarce, and/or the data series are short or interrupted,
geomorphological interpretation of the physical environment, dating of
fluvial deposits and flooding episodes and hydraulic reconstruction of
past flood events can be used as complementary tools aiding conventional
hydrological and flood frequency analysis methods. This paper will
discuss the undertaking of this approach in the Guadalope Catchment in
northeast Spain. It will examine the findings in relation to the
inadequate design of existing structures such as dams, spillways, canals
and reservoirs, and will also look at the potential risks associated
with flooding at present.

PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods are the main natural hazard in many mountain areas due to
the high discharge and transport of sediment occurring in a few hours or
even minutes. The hydraulic modelling of flash-flood process in ungauged
mountain basins often requires the combination of different techniques
to understand the processes and to evaluate the risk.
This paper reports on results derived from the use of high-detail
topography obtained with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), classical
topographical techniques and dendrogeomorphological evidences. These
evidences can be seen in the impact on trees of rocks and woody debris
transported during torrential past floods, which gives rise to
paleostage indicators representing the minimum discharge elevation
during floods.
The combined use of topographic data and dendrogeomorphological
evidences to calibrate hydraulic models allowed us to characterize the
magnitude of a singular flood event that took place on December 18,
1997, in the Arroyo Cabrera mountain stream (Gredos mountain range).
The methodology was implemented on a stream reach (500 m in length)
featuring a hydraulic jump on stable bedrock, and numerous scarred trees
on its banks due to past floods. A high-resolution digital elevation
model (DEM) based on more than 4 million points was taken with a TLS,
with an average error of 5mm. Stream cross-sections and morphometrical
measurements of trees were subsequently collected with Total Station and
classical topographical techniques in order to calibrate the model. In
addition, paleostage indicators (PSIs) located on trees were dated using
dendrogeomorphological methods.
A 2D numerical flood model, based on a finite differences approach, was
performed to estimate the peak discharge of the flood. PSIs were used as
input to the hydraulic model in order to calibrate it. The methodology
developed provides useful information to reconstruct the magnitude of
the flood, such as mapping the flooded area on the DEM; the water depth,
or the pattern of the flow speed. The knowledge of the advantages and
disadvantages derived from combining the techniques used in this work
brings useful information for the elaboration of future flash flood
hazard maps in ungauged mountain catchments.

settlement developments into fragile areas, particularly flood plains,
due to the limited supply of suitable non-hazardous land. Developments
on these flood plains will be exposed to the risk of flooding. The Klang
Valley is well known for its serious problems with flash floods: they
generally occur four to five times a year and sometimes more often. Two
to three hours of heavy rain is enough to cause the river in the Klang
Valley to reach its peak discharge. Flash floods have led to intangible
psychological impacts on the effected residents. This research will
discuss the psychological impacts of flash flooding in two residential
areas with different levels of living community and different housing
constructions. The first is the properly planned settlement of TTDI Jaya
and the second is the squatter settlement of Kampung Haji Abdullah
Hukom. The information discussed here is drawn from interviews with the
residents and questionnaire surveys.

AB  - Flash floods from the severe storms that have occurred in years 2009 and
2010 brought material damages and risk for the affected areas
inhabitants. Flood risk assessment and prediction are well-developed
solutions of the natural hazards but flash floods from severe storms are
quite complicated issue in the sense of their proper prediction. Flash
floods are beyond the resolution of the numerical weather forecast
systems (NWFS). Another big issue is fact, that runoff of flash floods
is frequently outside of the river channels. The complex and
multi-perspective analysis of the landscape response to the severe storm
and high-precipitation intensity seems to be effective basis. Results of
our work is the prototype of methodology and application of the early
warning system based on GIS, hydrological modeling and effective
analysis of the radar and NWFS products, which could work in the
regional scale opposite to local early warning systems.

AB  - Flood warnings provide a well established way to help to reduce the
risks to life and property during flood events. Hydrological forecasts
are often used as a component of flood warning systems, and can improve
the accuracy of warnings and the lead time available, giving more time
to protect property and evacuate areas at risk. The lead time may also
be extended by using Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts and other
meteorological forecasts. The types of hydrological models which are
used include rainfall-runoff, flow routing and hydrodynamic models, as
well as more empirical approaches, such as peak to peak correlations.
Models are usually operated within a forecasting system which gathers
data, schedules model runs, and post-processes model outputs into
map-based and other products. Data assimilation techniques are also
widely used both to initialize model runs, and in the post-processing of
model outputs. This chapter provides an introduction to these topics,
and discusses developing areas such as decision support systems for
flood event management, and the use of ensemble flood forecasts.

AB  - In recent years, non-structural measures based on Early Warning Systems
increasingly play a relevant role in hydrogeological risk mitigation.
Consequently, modelling of all the phenomena related to floods and
landslides induced by rainfall, should be developed, with the aim of
gaining accurate simulations and forecasting the events with a lag time
large enough for activating civil protection measures. Indeed, in all
the cases where the phenomenon rapidly evolves, like flash floods or
shallow landslides, the lag time between observed rainfall and flood or
landslide occurrence can be too short and must be extended by rainfall
fields forecasting. The paper describes several mathematical models,
developed at CAMILab laboratory of ``Dipartimento di Difesa del
Suolo{''} (University of Calabria), which are operating into Early
Warning Systems. The models represent different processes and are
integrated in order to firstly provide the nowcasting of precursor
(rainfall) and then the occurrence evaluation of induced phenomena
(floods and landslides). As regards rainfall nowcasting, stochastic
models (temporal and space-time ones) and a coupled meteorological and
stochastic model are illustrated. According to space-time scale and data
availability, flood forecasting for real time warnings can be performed
by using different rainfall runoff models. Finally, for triggering
conditions of landslides, a hydrological model and a complete landslide
are considered.

AB  - The European Parliament presented a Directive (2007/60/CE), related with
the evaluation and management of flood risks. The document intends to
reduce the risk of damaging consequences associated to floods in human
being health and lives, environment, cultural patrimony, economic
activities and infra-structures. This risk is calculated as the product
of the probability of flooding with its (damaging) consequences.
Flooding is defined as water covering land that usually is not covered
by water. This definition includes coastal, river and estuarine areas.
Waves action on natural coastlines is influenced by numerous parameters,
such as wave energy, tides, bathymetry and topography, shoreline
morphology and sediment budget, to name a few. Similarly, a large number
of factors can be associated with river flood risk, such as land
occupation, topography and meteorological conditions. This paper
presents storm surges and river floods impacts and mitigation
strategies, highlighting the actual knowledge to reduce floods damaging
to infrastructure or property, and cause lower human and economic
losses.

characteristics in the Upper Nan Watershed. The results revealed that
the mean annual rainfall of the Upper NanWatershed ranged between
1,083.9 to 2,335.7 mm; however, the high mountain area at the upper part
had a greater chance of the mean annual rainfall than the undulated area
at the central and lower part of the watershed. The onset rainy season
(OSM: May to June) and the rainy season (SM: July to September) yielded
the maximum rainfall amount (25.6% and 54.5% of mean annual rainfall).
The synoptic conditions, that influenced the rainfall characteristics in
this area, were AITCZ, WITCZ, AITCZ-D&L2, ASW and WSW. The results of
this study indicated that the Upper Part of Mae Nam Nan Subwatershed and
Nam Yoa 1 Subwatershed were the most flash flood risk area from the
heavy raining conditions of the Upper Nan Watershed.

AB  - Sediment-laden flows over erodible bed normally feature multiple time
scales. The time scales of sediment transport and bed deformation
relative to the flow essentially measure how fast sediment transport
adapts to capacity regime in line with local flow scenario and the bed
deforms as compared to the flow, which literally dictate if a capacity
based and/or decoupled model is justified. This paper synthesizes the
recently developed multiscale theory for sediment-laden flows over
erodible bed, with bed load and suspended load transport respectively.
It is unravelled that bed load transport can adapt to capacity
sufficiently rapidly even under highly unsteady flows and thus a
capacity model is mostly applicable, whereas a non-capacity model is
critical for suspended sediment because of the lower rate of adaptation
to capacity. Physically coupled modeling is critical for cases
characterized by rapid bed variation. Applications are outlined on flash
floods and landslide dam break floods.

over the next 50 years using topographic and geographical information,
including hydrology analysis. A high rate of precipitation has been
observed in the southwest Bay Area for the past five years where
rainfall, as an extreme natural event, caused flash flooding. The flow
direction is towards the City of San Jose which faces a high risk of

AB  - Flood Risk Map is one of the important non-engineering measures for
flood control and disaster reduction. Based on the concept of flood
disaster management system, the index system of potential flash flood
disaster risk assessment was developed in consideration of the
principle, hierarchy structure, measure standard, risk class and risk
index. The assessment cells with type of vector plane and raster point
were explained. The methods, such as analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy
synthetic evaluation and spatial analysis, were used to establish a
valuation model for potential flash flood disaster risk of Sub-basin.
Run this model, the Flood Risk Map in the aim basin can be drawn
automatically through the development of Arc GIS by Arc Engine. Flood
disasters risk of a sub-basin lack of flood data in Huai River was
evaluated with the application of this model, from the result, we can
know that risk assessment with this model is more objectively and
accurately than with the traditional models because soil moisture was
considered. So, Flood risk assessment with this model is more workable
in sub-basin.

AB  - Climate changes, irrational exploitation of the land and lack of a
sustainable protective infrastructure against extreme phenomenological
phenomena make Romania an area vulnerable to frequent floods. If on the
middle and low courses of major rivers the hydrotechnical infrastructure
has been improved in order to prevent against floods, the small water
courses often remain vulnerable to flash flooding due to the rains with
a torrential character. Such basins quickly respond to heavy
precipitations because of the steep slopes and impervious surfaces,
saturated soils or because of the anthropogenic changes (deforestation
or fires, for example) that cause changes of the natural drainage. Jifia
hydrographic basin is an area where the hydrological risk exists and
manifests itself along both Jiiariver and its tributaries. The
geographical position of the basin and the torrential rains caused by
the specific of cyclonal activity in this area create favorable
conditions for the release of flash flows in more subbasins. The high
amounts of rainfall in a short time produce very large flows which often
cannot be taken by minor riverbeds.

AB  - A semidistributed hydrologic model addressed to flood risk assessment is
presented. The model has been applied and calibrated by means of a
multistep calibration scheme to the Pejibaye River Basin in a series of
flash flood events that occurred between 2006 and 2009. The model
consists of a rainfall-runoff module, a surface runoff routing module
(unit hydrograph method), a base flow module (linear reservoir method),
and a channel-routing module. Two different unit hydrographs were
contrasted and two different approaches (continuous and discrete) were
used for average rainfall estimation. Model parameters were initially
estimated by using classical formulation and documentation, and
afterward were compared with calibrated parameters. The combination of
the different unit hydrographs and average rainfall estimation
procedures presented significantly different prediction errors.
Rainfall-runoff and base flow methods showed a stable and reasonable
behavior. Rainfall input was highlighted as a major source of error.
However, the continuous method for average rainfall estimation was noted
to slightly reduce timing errors as compared with the discrete method.
Overall, the model reproduced reasonably the flash floods analyzed in
this paper, both in calibration and validation (R-2 between 0.81 and
0.87; Nash-Sutcliffe between 0.70 and 0.80), and therefore could be also
suitable for other watersheds with similar climatic and geomorphologic
conditions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000568. (C) 2012 American

AB  - Many countries globally have experienced considerable changes in their
climatic and meteorological conditions, leading to extreme inundation
extent and increased frequency in flooding. The problems arising range
from minor impacts, such as frequent flash flooding, to major incidents,
where larger areas are inundated for several days after a storm event.
The spilling and flowing of floodwater over these areas can become a
serious problem, where it can even cause potential risk to human life,
as well as health and much damage to property. Recently, flood hazard
relating to vehicles have become more noticeable. Thus, it is desirable
to assess the hydraulic behaviour and safety degree of vehicles during
floods using hydrodynamic models. In this paper, the numerical model for
assessing the flood hazard risk relating to vehicles has been applied to
establish an understanding of the hydrodynamics of floodwater flows over
floodplains with vehicles; a condition which can be very important for
extreme storm events, or even moderate storm events, when the storm
water system is insufficient to drain away the surface runoff. The
calibrated and verified numerical model has been included to simulate
the conditions with different Average Recurrence Intervals (ARI) in a
real floodplain, at the township of Muar, Johor, Malaysia. Extensive
investigations have been undertaken to investigate the effects of
vehicles on floodwater flow propagation over floodplains and, on the
other hand, the influence of the floodwater flows on the stability of
model vehicles. The two principal factors of hazards (i.e. the
floodwater depth and flow velocity) that affect the stability of model
vehicles have been identified to estimate the flood hazard risk relating
to vehicles, with the aim of studying the impacts on aspects of the
hydrodynamic processes. Comparisons of the velocity profiles and water
elevations have been undertaken. The results have highlighted that the
model vehicles had a significant impact on the floodwater flow
propagation and the hydrodynamic processes in the flooded area. The
numerical model can be readily used to estimate the degree of hydraulic
stability for vehicles, and it is also invaluable for assessing the
potential flood hazard risk to vehicles for improved flood risk
management.

AB  - The changes of the underlying surface conditions (topography, vegetation
cover rate, etc.), which were caused by the numerous landslides in the
Wenchuan earthquake, may influence the hydrologic response and then
change the flash flood or other kinds of the disaster risk in the
affected areas. The Jianpinggou catchment, located in Sichuan China, is
selected as the study area for this paper. The distribution of the
landslides is obtained from the remote sensing image data. The changes
of topography are obtained from the comparisons among the different
periods of digital elevation models (DEMs). A physical-based model, the
Integrated Hydrology Model (InHM), is used to simulate the hydrologic
response before and after the landslide, respectively. The influence of
the underlying surface conditions is then discussed based on the output
data, such as the hydrograph, distributed water depth and local runoff.
The study leads to the following generalized conclusions: 1) the impact
of the landslides on hydrologic response does exist, and the greater the
proportion of surface flow in the total runoff is, the greater the
impact will be; 2) the peak flow from the outlet increased after the
landslide, but the shape of the hydrograph has little change; 3) the
effect of the landslides on the local runoff is relatively obvious, and
this elevates the local flash floods risk; 4) the difference of
hydrologic responses between the two periods (before and after the
landslide occurring) becomes larger with the increasing rainfall, with a
threshold of rapid growth at the rainfall frequencies of once in every
50 years, but there is a limit. The improved understanding of the impact
of landslides on the hydrologic response in Jianpinggou catchment
provides valuable theoretical support for the storm flood forecast.

AB  - Urban river basins are vulnerable to floods due to intense rainfall, and
hence posing a danger to communities. Non-structural flood measures,
including forecasting and warning are indispensable to complement
structural measures. Nonetheless, predictability of flash flood events
is considered limited because of high spatial and temporal variability.
In this research, uncertainties in the short torrential rainfall and its
corresponding flood in urban river basin are explored. Uncertainty in
rainfall prediction is assessed by developing ensemble prediction
system. Initial condition of the translation model is perturbed based on
advection vector incorrectness. An updating scheme is introduced to
provide more reliable rainfall short-term prediction. Parametric
uncertainty of the CDRMV3 distributed hydrological model is analyzed by
perturbing the model parameters with scalar multiplier. Two sensitive
parameters of the rainfall-runoff model are each perturbed five times
within their physical bounds. The range of uncertainty generated by
ensemble prediction and their potential for obtaining flood risk
estimates is demonstrated. Understanding sources of uncertainties of
complex dynamic systems and communicating the predictive uncertainties
remain challenges in using ensemble operationally. Yet, the proposed
system employing a fix number of members allows for a simple system,
which is essential in the flash flood warning context. The approach is
demonstrated through case studies in Sumiyoshi River Basin Japan, which
passes through a highly urbanized area in Kobe City, Japan. Verified
with observed data, the combined input-parameter ensemble could serve as
a reliable and effective system for operational flood disaster
prevention in urban area. The advantages of ensemble prediction over the
single deterministic forecast are demonstrated. Uncertainty assessment
in rainfall-runoff model parameters gives important information
regarding the potential of flooding. The ensemble technique is less
sophisticated and easier to be communicated to non-expert users in the
operational systems. It could be a useful approach to manage the
uncertainty in the flood short-term prediction in urban river basin and
elevate the public security from the flash flood threat.

AB  - This paper focuses on the spatial coexistence between different hazards
(strong west winds, beach sedimentary crisis and flash floods) in
outlets of small catchments in a sedimentary basin. This study was
carried out in the department of Upper Normandy located in north-western
France. To anticipate possible future hazards and damages without
depending on meteorological triggers (neither intense rainfall nor
synoptic conditions), we combine previous knowledge accumulated on local
phenomena to highlight the pre-conditioning factors and identify those
areas characterised by the highest susceptibility to risk due to the
accumulation of numerous hazards. This approach enables both space and
time distribution patterns of natural hazards to be revealed. In space,
the risk susceptibility strongly depends on morphology. Populations
located at the outlet of large wet valleys, at the final outlets of
small basins at a short distance from the plateaus and on the coastal
fringe appear to be the most endangered. Even if hazards never occur at
the same time, these areas can be affected by different hazards during
one year (summer flash floods, floods, winter storm surges). This study
identifies 14 sensitive areas along hollow shapes of the study area.
Finally, our methodological investigations question the creation of a
warning system combining mainland and marine hazards in these 14
outlets.

T1  - Cloudburst and Landslides in Uttarakhand: Nature's Fury?
A1  - Ashutosh, Mishra
Y1  - 2013///
PD  - 
AB  - Cloudburst is one of the major natural disasters in Uttarakhand State of
India and this brings flash floods, landslides and massive destruction
of property and lives almost every year in the state. The present paper
discusses about flood and landslides which occurred due to cloud burst
and heavy downpour in between 14 to 17 June, 2013 in the state.
Uttarakhand is very susceptible to landslides and almost three fourth of
the total geographical area of the state comes under severe to high
landslide risk zone. The catastrophe started with cloud burst near
Rambara in Rudraprayag district and due to torrential and continuous
rainfall, almost all the major rivers and especially the Mandakini and
the Alaknanda swelled up. Overflowing water reservoirs of the region
catalysed the severity of the event.
About one tenth of the upper catchment area of Mandakini river swept
away due to flood and landslide. This was the deadliest hazard in 80
years' history of the state which affected about 80,000 people. The
paper reflects the nature's supremacy over human potentials and
advocates the balanced man-nature relationship, especially in such
terrains which are most fragile and critically balanced. It suggests the
judicious use of Himalayan resources and use of environment friendly
techniques in implementing the development plan for the region.

AB  - Global change, including climate, land-use and socio-economic changes,
is expected to increase the stress on the entire water cycle. In the
Mediterranean region, extreme events are likely to increase due to
climate change. This work, framed in the EC Seventh Framework Programme
project IMPRINTS, presents a methodology to obtain future flood risk
maps using climate and land-use scenarios, identifying the new potential
risk zones. The implementation of this methodology is applied to the
Llobregat river basin case study. Two different special report on
emission scenarios are used, and although the uncertainties are high,
the results obtained are coincident: an increase of flood risk is
observed in the whole Low Llobregat area. The climate changes affect the
basin globally, increasing the risk homogeneously within the area
considered. On the other hand, land-use changes represent urban growth
in the floodplains, and hence, local risk increases are found in these
spots.

AB  - In October 2010 a rainstorm hit some municipalities in Liguria (NW
Italy) resulting in flash floods and debris floods. Rescue operations
were carried out without situational awareness due to phone and cellular
line failure and civil protection plan deficiency. Relief operations
were carried out to recover to previous state with no lesson learned
analysis nor legislative upgrade. A window of opportunity opened to
fulfill the disaster management cycle theory. On October/November 2011,
when a wider event struck both Tuscany and Liguria regions causing 12
fatalities, the situation was, more or less, the same as the past year:
the window of opportunity closed without a reduction in risk exposure.
After this last event Ligurian Region administration started to re-
evaluate hazard mapping and risk assessment methodologies, since debris
floods were not considered in official hazard maps and urban planning
regulations. But a month later, the temporary building restrictions were
reformed to low strict level. Different to Northwest Italy extensive
floods of 1994, that led Italy to a new approach to hazard planning and
risk evaluation, Liguria 2010/2011 events did not to seemingly involve,
bureaucracy and civil society on the new resilience concept and on the

AB  - Rainfall `nowcasts' from Weather Radar are of great value for flood risk
management when lead-time is amongst the top priorities, as for example,
in the case of flash flooding. Although radar-based `nowcasting'
generally outperforms its longer-term counterpart from numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models, the uncertainty associated with rainfall inputs
when driving a hydrological forecast often overwhelms that from
raingauge observations, let alone model parameterisation issues.
Furthermore, it too is very difficult to quantify in the case of coupled
nowcast driven hydrological forecasts. The STEPS (Short-Term Ensemble
Prediction System), as one of the most sophisticated `nowcasting'
systems currently available, it benefits from its inherent capability of
representing uncertainty from atmospheric dynamics at different scales
using ensemble forecasts. It can at least partially represent the
uncertainties associated with the `nowcasts'. It is interesting and
desirable to examine how a STEPS-driven hydrological forecast can also
benefit from this better uncertainty representation. This study focuses
on a coupled STEPS-hydrological modeling system developed for the Upper
Medway Catchment located in the South East of England.

PD  - 
AB  - This paper aims to assess risks due to potential Flash Floods hazards in
Wadi Mousa and to determine the magnitude of flows for flash flood
hazards and construct Floodplain Zone maps for the selected flood return
periods of 25, 50, 75 and 100 years. Wadi Mousa is considered an
ephemeral wadi with intermittent flash flood of flows that can exceed
the 298 m(3)/s threshold. Its floods, however, do not flow every year.
Nevertheless, at certain years the extent of flood can be huge. The
surface drainage may be broadly divided into sub-catchments according to
drainage namely; Wadi Als-Sader, Wadi Jelwakh with Wadi Khaleel, Wadi
Al-Maghir. Wadi Zarraba is the confluence of the three sub-catchments.
The study covers an area of 53.3 km(2) and comprises a high semi -arid
infrequent flash floods generated by heavy rainstorm over the catchment
and flows to Wadi Araba. Average annual rainfall of Wadi Mousa was
calculated of 178 mm, and average annual evapotranspiration is 1300 mm
per year. The runoff analysis indicates that only rainfall events
exceeding 22 mm within the 24 hour period would generate runoff. (C)

AB  - Floods are one of the most devastating natural hazards around the world,
and flash floods are extremely dangerous to property and human lives.
This study reviews the current flash flood forecasting in China and
proposes a new methodology to develop a flash flood potential index
(FFPI) based on GIS to further improve China's flash flood guidance
system and national weather forecasting services. We collected datasets
required to calculate the FFPI and tested a series of schemes to
determine the method to calculate the FFPI over China. The result
indicates that the calculated China's FFPI distribution can represent
the risk of flash flood well, especially in Central and Southeast China.
It is also implied that the southwest and western complex terrains are
more susceptible to rain storms. Then we chose Yunnan Province as a
test-bed and also yielded good results which can offer reference to the
current China's flash flood forecasting system. Further research can be
placed on incorporation of soil moisture and rainfall frequency
components into the FFPI calculation method for dynamic warning and
forecasting of flash floods.

PD  - 
AB  - On November 25, 2009, heavy amount of rainfall precipitated in the city
of Jeddah that led to floods causing unexpected loss of life (113 person
died), and damaged public and private properties (10,000 cars were
damaged/destroyed, and many houses, roads, highways, and industrial
properties were also affected). The city of Jeddah is located within an
independent mega drainage basin with a surface area of 1,760 km(2). This
mega basin is divided into three major sub-basins (northern, middle, and
southern). Wadi Qus is located in the southern sub-basin with an area of
similar to 63 km(2). It passes through many of the neighborhoods such as
Al-Harazat, Al-Sawaid, Queza, Al-Mesaid, Al-Haramin Highway, and the
King Abdel Aziz University. These areas were severely damaged during the
flash flood event in 2009. The current study deals with the
determination of the best sites for the construction of flood control
dams, followed by a number of detailed studies to ensure that these
selected sites are appropriate. Geological, geotechnical, geophysical,
and hydrological investigations were conducted to identify the types of
rocks, the subsurface conditions, and the geotechnical properties of
abutment and subsurface of soil and rock in the dam sites. The study
found that there are three locations that can be appropriate for the
construction of the flood control dams at Wadi Qus. Hydrological studies
indicated that the runoff volumes for sub-basins B1, B2, and B3 are
2,102,709, 1,023,156, and 4,868,304 m(3), respectively, for 500-year
return period and 2,356,081, 1,149,687, and 5,451,123 m(3),
respectively, for 1,000-year return period. Comparing these values with
the reservoir volumes calculated from the detailed ground survey with
different dam's height, it was found that dam's heights of 15.5, 11.5,
and 13.5 m for dams Q(01), Q(02), and Q(03), respectively, are adequate
for different basin volumes for 1,000-year return periods. Finally, the
conceptual designs have been prepared and recommended for these dams.

PD  - 
AB  - The European Water Framework and Floods Directives have brought a legal
framework favouring the good ecologic and geomorphological condition of
water courses. This may conflicts concerning the current management of
large wood in rivers in Spain, which has been traditionally focused on
removal of this material from the rivers. In addition, identifying
stream reaches where large wood is a potential hazard and where
therefore its careful management is necessary is also needed for flood
hazard and risk assessment. In this study, we have developed a numerical
model to simulate wood transport coupled to a 2D hydrodynamic model. We
applied this model in a mountain river reach crossing a village in
Central Spain. This river is flash flood prone and large amounts of wood
have been observed after flood events, but there is not detailed
information about its influence on hydrodynamics so far. The aim was to
analyse how the transport and deposition of wood influences flood risk
estimation in this mountain village by means of a probabilistic approach
to the numerical modeling. As a result, the most sensitive
infrastructures to the passage of large wood have been identified, as
well as the potential consequences of their blockage. When wood clogs
these bridges, the main effect is the backwater effect upstream from
these critical sections, where wood is trapped and deposited. High
hazard areas (based on water depth and flow velocity) increases
significantly and the potential economic damages may increase up to 50
% for the worst case scenario.

resilience. In this study, three case studies examining multiple natural
hazards, catastrophic landslides and flash floods in the study area of
Northern Czechia are presented. The study of documentary data enabled us
to reconstruct the social impacts of these hazards and the historical
responses of communities to these impacts. Our results indicate that
communities were frequently affected by various natural hazards and
developed specific mitigation and recovery measures that might inspire

AB  - For decades, image based velocimetry techniques, both in the Eulerian
and Lagrangian frame of references, have played an important role for
the understanding of several environmental and hydraulics phenomena. The
constant technological developments have made sensors more accessible to
the end user, thus they are nowadays a viable option to perform
measurements in a broad range of problems. There have been a scientific
and engineering interest to use image based velocimetry techniques to
describe large-scale phenomena and in particular, in fluvial hydraulics,
to improve our understanding of natural and artificial large-scale open
channel flows. This paper presents recent contributions, by the authors
of this work, to the development and application of Large-Scale Particle
Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) and Large-Scale Particle Tracking Velocimetry
(LSPTV). The work shows the results of the application of LSPIV to the
measurement of flow discharges in Mountain Rivers of the Cordoba
province in Argentina. These rivers are characterized by a high flow
variability, mainly due to the occurrence of flash floodings. Due to the
extreme flow condition during these events, the use of intrusive
measurement technologies such as current meters or Acoustic Doppler
Current Profiler (ADCP) is difficult due to the high risk for the
integrity of instruments and operators. The LSPIV technique has been
implemented using remote digital cameras mounted on a crane, and on an
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The work also present the results of
LSPTV in a large-scale physical model experiment. The development of a
software for the application of both techniques is also described in
this paper. In particular the pre and post-processing techniques
implemented in the software are described. These techniques, such as
data rectification and unsteady movements compensation, are crucial for
the successful application of LSPIV and LSPTV in large-scale conditions.

information systems in hydro-meteorological hazards and groundwater
hazard that cause a wide variety of losses. A series of major disasters
such as floods, flash floods, droughts, cyclones, extreme weather
events, including the groundwater contamination were witnessed in India.
The decadal analyses indicate that the frequencies of naturally
occurring disasters were increased since 1970. Both frequency and
intensity of floods and the extreme temperature events have increased
considerably, which have a correspondence with global climate change.
With the help of various case studies of disasters across India, this
paper demonstrates geospatial approaches to illustrate the nature of
damage and vulnerable areas. Innovations in space technology and
geospatial approaches have catered newer dimensions for timely detection
and monitoring of disasters. Albeit some actions and measures are taken
up at national level for disaster management, there are challenges to
alleviate the risk of future disasters as the frequency as well as
intensity are expected to increase under climate change.

PD  - 
AB  - Climate change is predicted to result in more frequent occurrences of
extreme flood events, such as flash flooding. This being the case, there
is now an increasing need for accurate flood protection design in the
areas susceptible to flash flooding. However, existing flood risk
assessment procedures and methods frequently used, including
simplifications of the computational processes, i.e. a ``simplification
strategy{''}, often do not adequately represent the complex hydrodynamic
processes associated with flash flooding and therefore lead to
inadequate flood protection designs. This paper examines what flood risk
assessment tools should be used for flood risk assessment in areas where
the emergence of flash flooding is possible. The 2004 Boscastle flash
flood, in the U.K. was selected as a typical case study. Firstly, the
appropriateness of the ``simplification strategy{''} was investigated,
as a flood risk assessment tool for areas prone to flash flooding. Three
different configurations of the DIVAST model were considered in this
study, including: (i) with shock-capturing (DIVAST-TVD), (ii) excluding
shock-capturing (DIVAST-ADI), and (iii) excluding the inertia terms. The
findings reported in this paper strongly suggest that applying the
``simplification strategy{''} is not appropriate for areas susceptible
to flash flooding. The results also show that this strategy can lead to
significantly erroneous predictions of the main parameters, such as
flood inundation extent. Secondly, two different flood hazard assessment
methods were tested, including: (i) a widely used empirically derived
method, and (ii) a new, experimentally derived, and physically based
method. The results obtained suggest that the flood hazard assessment in
areas prone to flash flooding should be conducted with physically based
methods, which take into account: (i) all of the physical forces acting
on a human body in floodwaters, and (ii) the rapid changes that often
occur in the flow regime, particularly where flash flooding exists.

PD  - 
AB  - As flash flood events are becoming more frequent, the development of
flood risk estimation methods is becoming more important than ever
before. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology in order to
study the flood risk in a river catchment by taking into account various
parameters that are organized in a spatial database (geological,
geomorphological, topographic and land use data). The collected data are
analyzed through the use of G.I.S software (ArcMap) in order to generate
the appropriate steps for the formation of the flood risk model.
Finally, we proceed to develop a probabilistic flood risk model (based
on the logistic regression) using as variables the lithology, the slope,
land use, average basin altitude. All the above variables are multiplied
by the proper weightsin the form of triangular fuzzy numbers. These
weights are related to the importance of each involved variable. This
model has been applied in the area of Samos Island, Greece with success.
The proposed methodology and the preliminary results, as exported for
the entire island prove the suitability of this method in the creation
of flood risk maps.

AB  - Flash floods are often responsible for many deaths and involve many
material damages. Regarding Mediterranean karst aquifers, the complexity
of connections, between surface and groundwater, as well as weather
non-stationarity patterns, increase difficulties in understanding the
basins behaviour and thus warning and protecting people. Furthermore,
given the recent changes in land use and extreme rainfall events,
knowledge of the past floods is no longer sufficient to manage flood
risks. Therefore the worst realistic flood that could occur should be
considered.
Physical and processes-based hydrological models are considered among
the best ways to forecast floods under diverse conditions. However, they
rarely match with the stakeholders' needs. In fact, the forecasting
services, the municipalities, and the civil security have difficulties
in running and interpreting data-consuming models in real-time, above
all if data are uncertain or non-existent. To face these social and
technical difficulties and help stakeholders, this study develops two
operational tools derived from these models. These tools aim at planning
real-time decisions given little, changing, and uncertain information
available, which are: (i) a hydrological graphical tool (abacus) to
estimate flood peak discharge from the karst past state and the
forecasted but uncertain intense rainfall; (ii) a GIS-based method
(MARE) to estimate the potential flooded pathways and areas, accounting
for runoff and karst contributions and considering land use changes.
Then, outputs of these tools are confronted to past and recent floods
and municipalities observations, and the impacts of uncertainties and
changes on planning decisions are discussed. The use of these tools on
the recent 2014 events demonstrated their reliability and interest for
stakeholders.
This study was realized on French Mediterranean basins, in close
collaboration with the Flood Forecasting Services (SPC Med-Ouest,
SCHAPI, municipalities).

AB  - A major hydrogeological problem affecting the Amalfi coast (Southern
Italy) involves slope-related processes mainly due to flash floods
typically characterized by landslides of debris flow type. These
processes are generated on slopes and interact heavily with river
dynamics, mobilizing huge quantities of material which are then carried
by the water course. In the area of Cava de' Tirreni, phenomena of
torrential spate have occurred regularly in historical times due to the
presence of volcaniclastic deposits and soils on slopes which are very
prone to being mobilized and washed away during rainfall events. For the
historical reconstruction of the 11-12th November 1773 flood event, over
one hundred archival sources contemporary to the event were examined, as
well as many bibliographic sources. The conclusions of our research were
compared and integrated with results from updated literature.

AB  - The Amalfi coast is one of the most beautiful areas in the world but
also one of the most exposed to geo-hydrological risk in Italy. It is
well known for the floods and landslides which have caused hundreds of
deaths and heavy damages in the past, as the flash flood event which hit
the Dragone Creek drainage basin in 2010, striking the Atrani village
located on the alluvial fan close to the sea. Such event caused the
death of a young girl who was working in a bar when a hyperconcentrated
flow invaded the premises quickly. Unfortunately, no alert was given to
citizens and so no evacuation was carried out to save them because of
the lack of an emergency plan for geo-hydrological risk mitigation.
After the event, local authorities established to realize it and to
prevent further victims. The plan here described was predisposed
following the ``Augustus method{''}, which represents the referential
scheme for emergency planning in Italy. In the plan the regional early
warning system was described and the risk scenarios were defined, then
the people in charge and the actions which they have to carry out during
the operative phases. The plan also included 5 detailed maps.

PD  - 
AB  - Globally, flood is a recurrently occurring damaging phenomenon. In terms
of flood related damages, approximately 90 % is reported from the
developing countries, where poverty is a major risk factor and holding
low resilience. Pakistan has no exception to it, where flood is a
frequently occurring adverse event. Pakistan is one of the flood prone
countries in the world because of its physical and climatic
characteristics. The Indus plain is occupied by more than 120 million
population, where agriculture is a major source of livelihood earnings.
Majority of them are poor section of the society and tenant cultivators.
During the span of 67 years (1947-2013), on average of 4-year, a severe
flood hit the country. The increasing population, degradation of
ecological environment and the changing climate scenario have further
multiplied the risk of flood disasters. It has been estimated that
Pakistan is suffering from frequent flood disasters and so far 11,239
human lives were lost, out which 1,985 is reported from the super-flood
of 2010. It was a century worst flood, where 20 million people were
affected and over 100,000 km 2 (1/5th of the country total area)
inundated and approximate to US$ 10 billion economic loss was
registered. Since the inception of Pakistan 1947, efforts have been made
for building resilience through various flood reduction approaches. The
existing flood reduction strategies range from structural to
non-structural measures. This chapter provides a review of risks
associated with flash and river flooding in Pakistan. It also gives an
analytical discussion on the historic flood events and their adverse
impacts. In addition, the flood risk reduction approaches undertaken so
far in Pakistan have also been discussed.

AB  - Taiwan is a small, populous island. Because little flat land remains
available for building, a trend in hillside development has recently
been observed. During the storm season, especially during typhoons,
heavy rainfall is common; however, the volume of rainfall is difficult
to predict. Heavy precipitation causes flash floods as surface and
groundwater levels overwhelm drainage systems. Thus people living on, or
close to, hills are at risk of experiencing flooding with little
warning. We investigated two models to discuss their differences and
impact of rainfall in upland locations. The tank model describes and
simulates the hydrology of an area, and the kinematic wave model
simulates rainfall at upland locations. We used two natural rainfall
events that occurred in the Tai-Chung basin as case studies for both
models. We applied five statistical indexes, namely root mean squared
error (RMSE), coefficient of efficiency (CE), percentage error of peak
discharge (EQp), error in time to peak (ETp), and percentage error of
total volume (EV) to evaluate and interpret hydraulic data and our
simulation results. We determined both models to be applicable; the
results showed the relative error in peak flow simulation for the upland
tank model to be less than 10%. The total runoff forecasts for
large-scale typhoon rainfall exhibited large errors in both models. Less
severe rainfall events produced lower percentage errors in both models.
The simulated hydrograph was compared with the measured hydrograph, and
little difference was observed in the performance of the models.
However, the simulation results of the kinematic wave model were
slightly more favourable, possibly because the more complex wave model
included more parameters representing physiographic factors, such as the
river flow parameters P and K, equivalent roughness values of N, the
average slope values, and the infiltration values, thus increasing the
accuracy of the simulation. The upland tank model did not require
complex physiographic factor parameters; instead, the Multistar-Powell
method was used to model the upland tank model parameters to produce a
simulated hydrograph, yielding results no less favourable than those
produced using the kinematic wave model. In the absence of comprehensive
measured data and physiographic factors, the upland tank model has
practical uses. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

PD  - 
AB  - The most vulnerable components of the territory are represented by urban
areas, located in geo-environmental contexts whose balances become
unstable because of natural physical changes (eg.: changing climate
conditions) and/or changes induced by human interventions (construction
of infrastructures, represented by someone, in the pejorative way, with
the term ``overbuilding{''}).
The city, as anintegrated system of infrastructures, may be exposed not
only to the critical geo-environmental hazard of the site where they are
located (eg. coastal erosion, slope instability, subsidence, flooding,
etc.) but also to those generated by boundary areas, sometimes even at a
considerable distance.
The recent meteorological history shows a growing incidence of
hydrological and hydrogeological events (such as, for example, storms in
Genoa in 2011 and 2014, the ones in Sardinia, Calabria, Sicily,
Benevento, etc., all occurred in the last five years), demonstrating an
increasingprobability of involvement of towns.
The research of strategies of prevention and protection is a difficult
task to deal with, but politics, as a consequence of recurring loss of
life and the huge costs that burden on society, has to consider it as a
priority. In this scenery, the activity of planning, considered as the
activity of organization of a urban settlement afterwards a rigorous and
accurate analysis of all relevant aspects, both human and natural, plays
a major role to obtain acceptable risk level.

AB  - In an attempt to do a back analysis of the damages caused to a
nineteenth century masonry structure due to the October 2009 flash
flood/debris flow event in Scaletta Zanclea, the flood discharge
hydrograph is reconstructed in the ungauged conditions. The hydrograph
for the solid discharge is then estimated by scaling up the liquid
volume to the estimated debris volume. The debris flow diffusion is
simulated by solving the differential equations for a single-phase 2D
flow employing triangular mesh elements, taking into account also the
channelling of the flow through the buildings. The damage to the
building is modelled, based on the maximum hydraulic actions caused by
the debris flow, using 2D finite shell elements to model the building,
boundary conditions provided by the openings, floor slab, orthogonal
wall panels, and the foundation. The reconstruction of the event and the
damages to the case-study building confirms the location of the damages
induced by the event.

AB  - This paper is focused on current possibilities of the measurement and
predictions of intense convective precipitation through the mobile
meteorological radar (MMR50). This meteorological radar equipment is
part of the Information, Notification and Warning system of the Zlin
Region in the Czech Republic, which consists of information and
communication infrastructure for dealing with extraordinary events. The
first chapter describes basic principles of radar precipitation
measurement, e.g. radar estimate of rainfall intensity and radar
products. The second chapter presents a methodology of measuring and
predicting of intense convective precipitation using the mobile
meteorological radar (MMR50), including other possibilities of
precipitation forecast as NWP models, aerological, satellite, station
measurements, statistics of historical situations, the risk of flash
floods on the degree of soils saturation and the possibility of
observation of dangerous accompanying phenomena. The last chapter deals
with the verification of the principles of radar measurements and
forecasts in a case study on 24th July 2015. Torrential rainfall in a
combination with hail and strong wind gusts caused heavy flooding in the
central part of Zlin region, which caused considerable material damage.
Timely and quality information about the current and future formation
and development of intense convective precipitation is essential for
flood prevention measures. Acquired findings and conclusions can be used
for crisis management in case of a possible occurrence of flash floods.

AB  - Indonesia poses as a country with the highest risk of natural disaster
in Southeast Asia. With no less than 130 active volcanoes, volcanic
eruption and lahars as the secondary hazard become inevitable. Major
damage and casualties had been reported, thus encourage more proper
mitigation measures to be applied. This study propose a retarding basin
as a possible measure to decrease the magnitude of lahars by providing
runoff control function as a reservoir containing a substantial volume
of water at a predetermined conservation pool level. The aim of this
study is to discuss the best location for retarding basin to retain
stormwater during lahars and flash flood occurrence. A case study of
Bladak catchment in Kelud volcano is taken. There are three main
parameters used to determine the most proper retarding basin sites in
this study, such as soils, slope, and land cover. The soils in Bladak
catchment is classified in Hydrological Soil Group (HSG) as type A,
while its topographic features and land cover are more varied. Taking
into account river gradient of Bladak river and the positions of
existing sabo dams cannot be separated from the spatial analysis of the
topography and land cover to produce suitable areas for retarding basin
installation. The retarding basin may pose as an effective mitigation
measure for lahars and flash flood in volcanic slope since it also has
functions of water quality and quantity control in addition to
ecological function as a green area. By placing retarding basin in the
secondary channels before they join into the primary channel, it is
expected to reduce the magnitude of rapid accumulation streamflow
following storm events.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - The new policy of flood risk management is to give more attention to
non-structural measures, allowing people to ``live with floods{''}
rather than ``fight floods{''}. To protect existing buildings there are
two main mitigation strategies: dry proofing and wet proofing. One
measure of dry proofing is the shielding, consisting in the use of flood
barriers, which can be installed at the entrance of the buildings or at
a certain distance from them (including the placing along the banks or
crossing a street). These flood protection structures are easier and
faster to install rather than sandbags. This paper shows the results
applied to a case study in the city of Barcellona, Sicily, Italy that is
crossed by a river and suffered a severe inundation in November 2011. To
study the effectiveness of using these flood barriers, a 2D hydrodynamic
model has been used: the barriers has been placed along a road to
inhibit the flow from flooding the protected area. While in North Europe
these types of barriers are commonly used, because those areas are
typically interested in clear water floods, in Italy flash floods and
mud-debris-flows are more frequent and limit their use. The purpose of
this work is to verify if these types of barriers are effective when
placed along Mediterranean river courses and, especially, to be sure
about their stability while subjected to the hydrodynamic effects of
these kind of events. To gain this aim, the computed stresses from the
modelling have been compared with the stability values of the barriers
provided by the producers, evaluating barriers' stability against
overturning and sliding. Simulations show how the flood barriers can
mitigate the hydraulic risk, being able to withstand the hydrodynamic
pressures and managing to divert the flow of water, thus avoiding that
the flood water hits very exposed areas.

AB  - The flash floods and the floods constitute the most dynamic and
dangerous hydrological risk phenomena. The floods from the Uz
hydrographic basin constitute important threats, having an unpredictable
character and a high distribution over time. For the analysis of the
occurred flash floods, it was utilized data registered at the Darmanesti
hydrometric station for the periods: 1977-1981 and 2001-2005. The data
was taken from the Siret-Bacau Water Basin Administration. Among the
registered flash floods in these periods were selected the most
important, having their frequency and their intensity analyzed. For the
periods 1977-1981 and 2001-2005 there have been included exceptional
flash floods, more precisely from the years 1978 and 2005. In order to
prevent and diminish the negative effects of the flash floods
occurrences, it was required the evaluation of the flash floods wave's
features: basis flow, peak flow, increasing time, decreasing time, total
time, the transited water volume, the drained water volume, the shape
coefficient, the specific maximum leakage. The features of the flash
floods were studied based on a temporal analysis. It has also been
analyzed the oscillation level during the flood, in comparison with the
attention elevations, flood elevations and danger elevations. It is
noteworthy that during all the years from the studied periods, flash
floods have occurred that exceeded the flooding elevation. The danger
elevation was exceeded in 57% of the cases for the period 1977-1981 and
in 86% of the cases for the period 2001-2005. The rise in frequency of
the extreme hydrometeorological phenomena due to climatic changes
distinguishes itself through a much larger scale of the flash floods
from 2005 in comparison to 1978. In this situation, the local population
was exposed to the risk, necessitating protection measures.

AB  - Flash flood hazard maps provide a scientific support to mitigate flash
flood risk. The present study develops a practical framework with the
help of integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling in order to
estimate the potential flash floods. We selected a small pilot catchment
which has already suffered from flash floods in the past. This catchment
is located in the Nan River basin, northern Thailand. Reliable
meteorological and hydrometric data are missing in the catchment.
Consequently, the entire upper basin of the main river was modelled with
the help of the hydrological modelling system PANTA RHEI. In this basin,
three monitoring stations are located along the main river. PANTA RHEI
was calibrated and validated with the extreme flood events in June 2011
and July 2008, respectively. The results show a good agreement with the
observed discharge data. In order to create potential flash flood
scenarios, synthetic rainfall series were derived from temporal rainfall
patterns based on the radar-rainfall observation and different rainfall
depths from regional rainfall frequency analysis. The temporal rainfall
patterns were characterized by catchment-averaged rainfall series
selected from 13 rainstorms in 2008 and 2011 within the region. For
regional rainfall frequency analysis, the well-known L-moments approach
and related criteria were used to examine extremely climatic homogeneity
of the region. According to the L-moments approach, Generalized Pareto
distribution was recognized as the regional frequency distribution. The
synthetic rainfall series were fed into the PANTA RHEI model. The
simulated results from PANTA RHEI were provided to a 2-D hydrodynamic
model (MEADFLOW), and various simulations were performed. Results from
the integrated modelling framework are used in the ongoing study to
regionalize and map the spatial distribution of flash flood hazards with
four levels of flood severities. As an overall outcome, the presented
framework can be applied in areas with inadequate runoff records.

AB  - Flash floods monitoring systems developed up to now generally enable a
real-time assessment of the potential flash-floods magnitudes based on
highly distributed hydrological models and weather radar records. The
approach presented here aims to go one step ahead by offering a direct
assessment of the potential impacts of flash floods on inhabited areas.
This approach is based on an a priori analysis of the considered area in
order (1) to evaluate based on a semi-automatic hydraulic approach
(Cartino method) the potentially flooded areas for different discharge
levels, and (2) to identify the associated buildings and/or population
at risk based on geographic databases. This preliminary analysis enables
to build a simplified impact model (discharge-impact curve) for each
river reach, which can be used to directly estimate the importance of
potentially affected assets based on the outputs of a distributed
rainfall-runoff model. This article presents a first case study
conducted in the Gard region (south eastern France). The first
validation results are presented in terms of (1) accuracy of the
delineation of the flooded areas estimated based on the Cartino method
and using a high resolution DTM, and (2) relevance and usefulness of the
impact model obtained. The impacts estimated at the event scale will now
be evaluated in a near future based on insurance claim data provided by
CCR (Caisse Centrale de Reassurrance).

AB  - Flooding and flash floods that cause significant economic and social
damage have been widely studied in the last few decades. The European
Commission Flood Directive 2007/60 Flood Risk Management Plans require
the assessment of potential damage to give an appreciation of the
magnitude of the consequences of a flood event and so help stakeholders
to use a cost benefit approach to planning flood mitigation measures.
This paper evaluates the direct tangible flood damage applying the JRC
water depth-damage functions for the European territory to estimate the
potential economic damage. Intangible damage is evaluated with the Life
Safety Model (LSM) to study the dynamic interactions among people,
vehicles, buildings and the flood wave. LSM assesses potential flood
damage and allows the development of a Flood Evacuation Plan in case of
an emergency, underlining the evacuation routes adopted by people and
vehicles. This enables emergency managers to avoid evacuation bottleneck
problems and identify areas of potential high mortality. The impact of
changes such as road network improvements, the location of safe havens
and timing of flood warnings can be assessed in terms of potential loss
of life. The developed methodology has been applied on the Sardinian
Flood Risk Management Plan pilot basin, the Coghinas river lowland
basin.

AB  - The Languedoc area, in Southern France, is prone to autumnal flash
floods which are characteristic of the Mediterranean climate. To cope
with this threat, the local authorities have chosen to build several
dams on the main dangerous rivers of the area. We have focused on the
flood mitigation facilities of two operators: the City of Nimes and the
Gardons Rivers Managing authority. After the catastrophic flash flood of
October 1988, the city of Nimes built flood mitigation dams on many of
its high-risk streams. These flood barriers worked several times during
the intense rainfalls of autumn 2014. The on-site conclusions drawn from
these floods and the computation carried out with hydrological models
confirmed how well the dams functioned. In 2010, the Gardons Rivers
Managing authority built a flood mitigation dam on the Esquielle River
to protect the village of Saint-Genies-de-Malgoires. The spillway of
this dam worked for the first time in the autumn of 2014. We analyzed
one of the major floods monitored on that occasion at its outlet. The
goals of this study are: (i) to evaluate dams efficiency and (ii) to
test, on a catchment which was not used for its calibration, the AIGA
flash flood warning method, which was developed by IRSTEA.

AB  - The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) estimates life loss resulting
from dam failure in support of dam safety risk analysis. To estimate
life loss, Reclamation relies primarily on an empirical methodology
which is tied to the interpretation of case histories of dam failures
and other types of flood disaster events. The method is known as
Reclamation's Consequences Estimation Methodology, or RCEM. RCEM is a
revision to an empirical method used by Reclamation since 1999, for
which the case history database has been substantially expanded. Case
histories, which come from dam failures, flash flood and coastal
flooding events, are the basis for data points used in the estimation of
fatality rates. Reclamation's RCEM methodology employs a graphical
approach for the selection of fatality rates based on ranges of DV
(depth multiplied by velocity) and warning time. DV is used to quantify
the intensity of flooding and can be related to lethality. The RCEM
methodology is in many ways similar to Reclamation's previous method,
DSO-9906. However, the new method requires greater application of
judgment when selecting fatality rates. The paper will provide an
overview of the new method, with emphasis on the case histories, and
discussion of the importance of a team approach to life loss estimation.

PD  - 
AB  - In France, flooding is the leading cause of mortality due to natural
disasters and cause very significant economic damage. The question of
risk forgetting has been identified as one of the key issues to reduce
these negative consequences of flooding. There is need to study this
oversight of risk on a long term basis, long after the event takes place
and when routines are re-established. This is the challenge faced by the
ethnographic dissertation summarized in this article: understanding the
mechanisms of risk forgetting by investigating how the issue of flooding
occurs in everyday life. The dissertation questions what circulates
about flooding between inhabitants and how they organize their practices
in relation to the risk. The field of study is a french suburban city
which was built on wetlands and remains vulnerable to flash floods. This
case study provides insight into the collective mechanisms from
invisible danger implementation. The increased visibility of the
protection made by local policies and the comforting effect of normative
sharing provided a normalization of the trust in the protection. Through
the interactions, statements are continually developed in the interests
of their acceptability: statements of relativism circulate more than the
ones that open on the horizon of danger. Moreover, the current
development of a logic of safety for social risks reduction contradicts
the prevention of flooding. Above all, neither the links between
inhabitants nor the links with their living environment provide a
sufficient collective development base for a risk culture deployment.

AB  - For a long time, flood risk management in France was oriented around
controlling the hazard with the installation of structural measures such
as dikes. Since the 1990s, however, numerous events have shown that
these measures are not always effective. As a result, institutions now
consider that other actions, such as preventive measures, are possible.
Risk management is based on public policies and involves a number of
players, as well as the societies exposed to the risks. The goal of our
study is to show the various orientations of risk management by looking
at several examples from Mediterranean France, where flash floods are
common, in particular using post event analysis. Post-event observations
let us evaluate the effectiveness of flood-management methods. Do public
policies work, and do they have a real influence on reducing deaths and
damage? Are individual measures overtaking collective ones? The main
results of our study show that the event itself is more important in
determining which measures are applied than public policies, which do
not take into account local specificities.

AB  - The French State services in charge of flood forecasting supervise about
22,000 km among the 120,000 km of the French rivers within a warning
procedure called Vigilance Crues (http://www.vigicrues.gouv.fr). Some
recent dramatic flood events on small watershed not covered by Vigilance
Crues highlight the need for a new warning procedure to anticipate
violent flash floods that regularly affect rapid river-basins. Thus the
concept emerged of an automatic warning service specifically dedicated
to local crisis managers. This service will be less elaborated than
Vigilance Crues, probably with false alarms and missed events sometimes,
but it will deliver a first information. The generation of the warning
is based on a simple rainfall-runoff hydrological model developed by
Irstea on all French rivers, fed with radar-gauge rainfall grids
provided by Meteo-France. Every fifteen minutes, the hydrological model
estimates the discharges on the rivers eligible to the service and
determine if certain thresholds corresponding to a high or very high
flood are likely to be exceeded. The last step of the real-time system
is to determine which municipalities are concerned with flood risk and
send them an automatic warning by voice call, optionally by sms or
email. A specific web interface is available for users to monitor the
evolution of the flood risk on maps that are updated every 15 minutes.
This new flash flood warning service will be operational early 2017 as a
free service for about 8,000 French municipalities.

Y1  - 2016///
PD  - 
AB  - Aim of this work is the development of an operational tool for pluvial
flooding warning in an urban area based on off-line rainfall thresholds
derived by coupling a rainfall runoff modelling and a hydraulic routing.
The critical conditions considered for issue flood warnings were not
only based on the water stage, but also on the extension of the flooded
area. Further, a risk assessment framework for quantifying the
reliability of the rainfall thresholds has been included; rainfall
thresholds used in pluvial flooding warning should be influenced by the
uncertainties in the rainfall characteristics (i.e. rainfall duration,
depth and storm pattern). This risk assessment framework incorporates
the correlated multivariate Monte Carlo simulation method, an hydraulic
model for the simulation of rainfall excess propagation over surface
urban drainage structures, i.e. streets and pathways. Thresholds
rainfall are defined using a number of inundation criteria, to analyze
the change in the rainfall threshold due to various definitions of
inundation. Starting from estimated water stages and flooded area from
inundation simulation rainfall thresholds can be obtained according a
specific inundation criterion, including, together, a critical water
depth and a critical flooding area. Finally, the second phase concerns
the imminence of a possible hydrological risk by comparing the time when
cumulative rainfall and rainfall thresholds meet to each other. The
developed procedure has been applied to the real case study of Mondello
catchment in Palermo (Italy).

programmes in hazardous areas in order to fight against the phenomenon
of risk oblivion that one can notice after a disaster. My university
thesis summarized in this article - questioned this possibility by
investigating how we live, in everyday life, in flood-prone areas.
Through an ethnographic piece of work, in particular a ``discreet

inhabitants exchange about floods and how they organize their practices
in relation to the risk. The field study, Lattes, is an upper
middle-class suburban neighborhood located in the South East of France
(Mediterranean coast). This city was built on wetlands and remains
vulnerable to flash floods. This case study allows us to grasp the
collective mechanisms at stake in the construction of the invisibility
of a danger. The high visibility of the protection made by local
policies and the comforting effect of normative sharing provided a
normalization of people's trust in the protection. Through interactions,
statements are built to be acceptable. It is more comfortable to
``de-dramatize{''} than to dramatize: statements of relativism circulate
more than the ones that open on the horizon of danger. Moreover, the
current development of a ``logic of safety{''} for urban risks reduction
contradicts the prevention of flooding. Above all, neither the links

a sufficient collective base for the deployment of a risk culture.

AB  - This article outlines the results of a descriptive study that analyses
loss and damage caused by hydrometeorological disasters in Brazil
between 2010 and 2014 using the EM DAT (global) and S2iD (national)
databases. The analysis shows major differences in the total number of
disaster events included in the databases (EMDAT = 36; S2iD = 4,070) and
estimated costs of loss and damage (EM-DAT - R$ 9.2 billion; S2iD - R$
331.4 billion). The analysis also shows that the five states most
affected by these events are Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas
Gerais, Sao Paulo and Parana in Brazil's South and Southeast regions and
that these results are consistent with the findings of other studies.
The costs of disasters were highest for housing, public infrastructure
works, collectively used public facilities, other public service
facilities, and state health and education facilities. The costs
associated with public health facilities were also high. Despite their
limitations, both databases demonstrated their usefulness for
determining seasonal and long-term trends and patterns, and risk areas,
and thus assist decision makers in identifying areas that are most
affected by and vulnerable to natural disasters.

PD  - 
AB  - To anticipate floods, the French current crisis management system uses
two tools. On one hand a meteorological vigilance provided by
Meteo-France, and on the other hand a flood vigilance coming from the
flood forecasting services.
After several flash floods of the lasts years, a feedback has shown how
difficult it is for some operators in the field to appropriate
information from these forecasts. There is some confusion between
vigilances and warnings, and between the different geographical levels
such as the whole department for Meteo-France vigilance, or monitored
rivers for flood forecasts which excludes upstream watersheds and small
tributaries.
In order to improve people information and warning, a few evolutions are
possible: training crisis managers, providing watershed meteorological
forecasts using hydrometeorological data, instead of departmental ones,
single reporting for flood and rain, developing a seriousness scale for
emergency preparedness.

PD  - 
AB  - Alluvial events in Italy are a constant and continuous problem due to
the peculiar orographic and climatic setting of the territory. Even
though less frequent than in the Alps, debris-flows and floods greatly
contributed also along the Southern Apennines to build alluvial fans, a
widespread geomorphic unit located at the catchment mouth. These areas
have been frequently chosen as sites for the urban development, as they
were considered safer than the valleys, for the lower probability of
being affected by floods. Due to the orographic position, the heavy
rainfall events characterizing the study area can lead to flash floods
with large debris loads. Such phenomena may be extremely risky for the
population, and cause heavy damages.
Starting from the consideration that past events can provide information
on future events, we compiled a database on alluvial events in
torrential catchments of Campania region, a highly prone area to such
phenomena. By consulting different types of information sources we
collected about 500 events. The database is being constantly updated,
and contains temporal and spatial information for each event, since
availability of these data is considered a mandatory step in order to
perform a correct hazard and risk analysis.

severe flood event, which took place on October 25th, 2009. Based on
spatial and meteorological data, a simulation of the flood event was
established, through hydrological modeling, in a GIS environment.
Furthermore, the geomorphological characteristics of the drainage basin
and the drainage network were analysed. The results of the modeling such
as the peak discharge, hydrograph, and volume, derived from the analysis
of measured hydrographs in a number of non-flood causing rainfall events
with operating stage gauge, were used for calibration and verification
of the simulated stage-discharge hydrographs. Drainage basin
characteristics such as steepness of the relief combined with a
relatively short main channel of the drainage network as well as
abnormalities in the hierarchical drainage by stream order are the main
natural flood causes amplified of course by the intense human
interference at the lower part of the drainage network with a series of
constructions such as roads inside the main channel. Geomorphological
analysis combined with GIS techniques are fundamental components of
flood risk management as they provide the basis for a broad
understanding of the relationship between river processes and flood
causes in a fast and effective way in the context of policy makers.

AB  - In Malaysia, flash floods are common occurrences throughout the year in
flood prone areas. In terms of flood extent, flash floods affect smaller
areas but because of its tendency to occur in densely urbanized areas,
the value of damaged property is high and disruption to traffic flow and
businesses are substantial. However, in river floods especially the
river floods of Kelantan and Pahang, the flood extent is widespread and
can extend over 1,000 square kilometers. Although the value of property
and density of affected population is lower, the damage inflicted by
these floods can also be high because the area affected is large. In
order to combat these floods, various flood mitigation measures have
been carried out. Structural flood mitigation alone can only provide
protection levels from 10 to 100 years Average Recurrence Intervals
(ARI). One of the economically effective non-structural approaches in
flood mitigation and flood management is using a geospatial technology
which involves flood forecasting and warning services to the flood prone
areas. This approach which involves the use of Geographical Information
Flood Forecasting system also includes the generation of a series of
flood maps. There are three types of flood maps namely Flood Hazard Map,
Flood Risk Map and Flood Evacuation Map. Flood Hazard Map is used to
determine areas susceptible to flooding when discharge from a stream
exceeds the bank-full stage. Early warnings of incoming flood events
will enable the flood victims to prepare themselves before flooding
occurs. Properties and life's can be saved by keeping their movable
properties above the flood levels and if necessary, an early evacuation
from the area. With respect to flood fighting, an early warning with
reference through a series of flood maps including flood hazard map,
flood risk map and flood evacuation map of the approaching flood should
be able to alert the organization in charge of the flood fighting
actions and the authority to undertake the necessary decisions, and the
general public to be aware of the impending danger. However this paper
will only discuss on the generations of Flood Hazard Maps and the use of
Flood Risk Map and Flood Evacuation Map by using geospatial data.

AB  - For flash flood mitigation, the water level at the upstream river should
be measured in a near real time manner to promptly assess the flood
risk. In this paper, the water level monitoring telemetry stations have
been designed and invented to keep tracking of the river water level.
However, there is no electric power supply and no wired communication in
the upstream river region. The telemetry station should be designed to
cope with these challenges. This paper proposed a self adaptive
telemetry station, SATS, that can automatically adjust its operation
mode to the environmental conditions. An automatic environmental
condition learning and evaluation mechanism, Auto-ELE, is also proposed
in this paper. The proposed mechanism adaptively adjusts the telemetry
station operation against the water level changes. The simulation
results show that the proposed mechanism yields to reduce the battery
utilization and keep accuracy of the data measurement.

built - DISASTER - with geographically identifiable sites, affected by
floods or landslides, which are associated with human losses
(casualties, injuries, missing, evacuated or homeless people),
regardless of their number. The results show the decennial evolution of
the occurrences, the distribution by hydrographic basin and by
morpho-structural units. There is a global distribution of occurrences
across the Portuguese mainland, with concentrations of occurrences and
human impacts on the banks of the Douro river and its tributaries, in
the middle and lower Tagus, in the lower Mondego and Agueda, which are
dominantly marked by progressive or flash flooding processes. It is also
verified the concentration of occurrences in spaces with intense use and
urban occupation, such Lisbon and Porto and its adjacent municipalities,
as well as the region of Coimbra or the Algarve, where flooding and the
slope instability cause human impacts. The hydrogeomorphological
episodes are thus natural processes associated with human losses with
the casualties and injuries, or a high number of evacuated and homeless
people, translating a territory of concern for the population and risk
managers.

AB  - Although rainfall patterns are complex and difficult to predict, climate
models suggest precipitation in Texas will occur less frequently and
with greater intensity in the future. In combination with rapid
population growth and development, extreme rainfall events are likely to
lead to flash floods and necessitate swift water rescues. Swift water
rescues are used to retrieve person(s) from swift water flowing at a
rate of 1 knot or greater. Data were obtained from the Texas Fire
Marshal's Office and analyzed to describe spatial and temporal
characteristics of rescues. Between 2005 and 2014, 3256 swift water
rescues were reported from 136 of 254 (54%) counties. Over half
(54.6%, n = 1777) occurred in counties known as Flash Flood Alley,
which includes Texas' largest and fastest growing cities. Less than
1.0% (n = 18) were reported from 49 counties designated as completely
rural, or with an urban population less than 2500. Increases in swift
water rescues were seen between March and September and during major
weather events such as tropical storms. Because county-level data was
utilized and demographic data was missing in all but 2% (n = 47) of the
incidents, our ability to identify populations at risk or target
interventions in the future using this data is limited. Despite the
frequency of flash flood events and swift water rescues in Texas,
knowledge gaps persist that should be addressed through the conduct of
interdisciplinary research by epidemiologists and climatologists and by
disseminating evidence-based health education and safety programs,
particularly in rapidly growing counties that make up Texas' Flash Flood
Alley. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open

AB  - We analyse the flooding of the River Turia around the city of Teruel
(Aragon, Spain) that occurred in June 1933. Contemporary newspaper
stories described the flood and its major effects. The use of various
documentary sources enables an estimation of the causes of the flood,
its volume, and main effects. This information is compared with current
calculations and cartographic sources and we conclude that this was a
significant historical flood and must he taken into consideration when
assessing current flood risks. The study also highlights the enormous
value of newspaper records in documenting floods in the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries.

AB  - In July 2008, five people were killed by a tragic flash flood caused by
a local torrential heavy rainfall in a short time in Toga River.
Fromthis tragic accident, we realized that a system which can detect
hazardous rain-cells in the earlier stage is strongly needed and would
provide an additional 5 to 10 min for evacuation. By analyzing this
event, we verified that a first radar echo aloft, by volume scan
observation, is a practical and important sign for early warning of
flash flood, and we named a first echo as a ``baby-rain-cell{''} of
Guerrilla-heavy rainfall. Also, we found a vertical vorticity criterion
for identifying hazardous rain-cells and developed a heavy rainfall
prediction system that has the important feature of not missing any
hazardous rain-cell. Being able to detect heavy rainfall by 23.6 min on
average before it reaches the ground, this system is implemented in
XRAIN in the Kinki area. Additionally, to resolve the relationship
between baby-rain-cell growth and vorticity behavior, we carried out an
analysis of vorticity inside baby-rain-cells and verified that a pair of
positive and negative vertical vortex tubes as well as an updraft
between them existed in a rain-cell in the early stage.

AB  - The flash floods forecasting is struggling mainly with extraordinary
irregularities in origin of causal precipitations. They only in
conjunction with the territory water saturation caused by antecedent
precipitations start effect of other local factors that can consequences
of short-term extreme precipitation either worsen or mitigate vice
versa. Other community area features represent a permanent potential for
an adequate territory response after heavy rains. According to current
knowledge, it is possible to assess the flash floods hazard of a
particular territory in case of extreme precipitation in advance. If
such precipitations are already on the ground, or if they are just
coming up in the atmosphere, the local flood control headquarters has at
least time enough to call alarm and issue a flood warning. In the ideal
case, it is possible to incorporate such area assessment into the
concept of decision-making of the disaster staff and to insert it into
the master plan documentation. The aim of this text is to present above
mentioned original method, which can be used in authomatic GIS
environment by public administration as well as other users. Suggested
procedure is based on automatic hydrologic modelling in ArcGIS platform
in combination with advanced digital terrain model. Delimitation of
partial catchment basins is also part of our proces, which enables to
decide about the risk value of the area in more detail using weighted
arithmetic mean. These methods result to detailed imagination about
probably threatened localities - and it is essential tool for local
authorities and their decision making process in case of early warning.

AB  - Debris flows seriously endanger the highway from Chengdu to Lhasa
(G318)and often interrupt traffic in rain seasons, especially at the
southeast of Tibet. A large-scale debris flow, occurred on June 23, 2012
at Haitong Watershed, blocked the Xiqu River and formed a dammed lake
with the average width of 60 m, the length of 300 m and the reservoir
volume of 90,000-100,000 m(3). The traffic of G318 Highway was
interrupted until June 30th as the result that the highway base was
buried about 230 m by debris flow deposits and inundated over 160 m by
dammed lake. The investigation and the analysis of debris flow deposit
samples showed that the debris flow delivered about 100,000 m(3)
sediment out of watershed, deposited along Xiqu River and formed a dam
with the length of 230 m, the width of 100 m and the average thickness
of 7-8 m. The clay content and density of debris flow deposits was
0.41-0.86% and 1.89-2.01 t/m(3), respectively. Using the parameters of
cross sections obtained by field measuring, the velocities and peak
discharge for debris flow were estimated, and the velocities of flow
reached 10.9-12.1 m/s by virtue of steep channel as well as the peak
discharge at the mouth, the right gully and the left gully was 924, 642
and 336 m(3)/s, respectively. The debris flow on June 23 formed a hazard
chain which was composed of flash flood, debris flow, dammed lake and
outburst flood, and the threshold of debris flow blocking river was that
the discharge, the magnitude and the deposits at river channel of debris
flow was 230-850 m(3)/s, 11,709 and 9233 m(3). The active tectonic
movement, abundant erosion deposits and steep geomorphology are
responsible for debris flow formation, the rainstorm after long-period
drought triggered debris flows and the sediments induced by channel
deposits initiation at the lower of the watershed further supplied and
enlarged debris flow. The highway risk were assessed using the model
which was established based on dynamic mechanism, and the high-dangerous
zone and middle-dangerous zone occupied 86.5%, which agreed with the
actual, where were buried by debris flow deposits or submerged by the
following dammed lake. Based on the hazards and risk of debris flows on
June 23, the protection measures, including dangerous debris flow
identification, risk assessment, rational route, integrated control and
emergency plans, were recommended.

AB  - Information given on flash floods in real time should undoubtedly
correspond to the citizens needs as well as to the politics and the
safety guidelines. To supply this objective, Numerical Social Networks
(NSN) and smartphone applications could positively complete the official
institutional system, especially by means of the dynamic nature of
shared contents, and with the social interactions they support.
Nonetheless, even if several countries (United States or Philippines for
example) already use these systems to warn the population in case of
future floods, and even if the French government launched a specific app
the 2016 June 8th (namely SAIP), the French citizens and stakeholders do
not always use them during the alert process. This is generally
explained by the French protection system on individual data, the lack
of validation over information shared by citizens in real time and by
the technical locks the official services have to remove. Then this
paper aims to address the benefits and limits from the use of NSN and
smartphones during flood warnings in France, and it also seeks to
identify the place of such systems to perform their utility in short
term.

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - The coast is one of the areas most affected by natural hazards, with
floods being the most frequent and significant of these in terms of
their induced impacts, so any management scheme requires their
evaluation. In coastal areas, flooding is a hazard associated with
different processes acting at different scales: coastal storms, flash
floods and sea level rise (SLR). To address the problem as a whole, this
study presents a methodology to undertake a preliminary integrated risk
assessment of the magnitude of each flood component, taking into account
their scope (extension of the affected area) and their temporal scale.
The risk is quantified using specific indicators to assess the hazard
magnitude (for each component) and the consequences. This allows for a
robust comparison of the spatial risk distribution along the coast in
order to identify both the most at-risk areas and the most influential
risk components. This methodology is applied to a stretch of coastline
(Maresme, Catalonia) representative of the Spanish Mediterranean coast.
The results obtained characterise this coastline as an area with a
relatively low overall risk, although some hotspots are identified as
having high-risk values.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed many drowning tragedies on roads, even where
flood gauges were equipped to warn drivers about the depth of the flood
water. The effectiveness of traditional flood gauges using the digit
representation has been questioned. According to the
attention-knowledge-compliance three-stage model, we propose that color
coding can improve the effect of flood gauges. The present study
compared the performance of a prototypical color flood gauge with two
types of digit flood gauges in four experiments. Our results revealed a
general advantage of color flood gauges over digit flood gauges in all
testing conditions (with or without reflection and dynamic or static
observation), which was manifested in both a sample of people lacking
driving experience and a sample of experienced drivers. Specifically,
the mean accuracy of color gauge conditions in the four experiments
increased by at least 16%, and the mean response time to the color
gauge was shortened by at least 0.8 s compared with the digit gauge. The
substantial benefit of color gauges over digit gauges suggests that
color coding can be used to improve the effectiveness of flood gauges on
flood-prone roads. Because of its low cost, the color coding flood gauge
may be useful in the developing world to warn against extreme rainfall.

AB  - In the last years, natural hazards related to flash floods have caused
serious damage and losses to the population of the state of Rio de
Janeiro. This research discusses the importance of implementing a
methodology for the prevention of flash floods, by comparing the methods
applied since 2013 in the city of Duque de Caxias, in the Baixada
Fluminense region of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the major
prevention actions suggested by the Flash Flood Early Warning System
Reference Guide from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, questioning civil defense professionals about the
importance of each method to vulnerable communities. Even without the
occurrence of an extreme event that proves the effectiveness of the
method between 2014 and 2016, the population will certainly be better
prepared to face the risks of disasters in the city in the future. In
addition, the study also underscores an approach of approximation
between academic studies and operational activities, which is still very

AB  - Desert environments are subject to flash floods in wadi floors, which
may occur only once every decade or two in a given wadi (dry channels or
valleys, except during rains). In areas of rapid growth, flood-prone
areas can become urbanized in the time between floods. Being flat and
constituted of sandy sediments, unlike the surrounding terrain, wadi
floors are often used for construction, exposing the new settlements to
flood risks. We present a case study of the town of El-Sheikh El-Shazli,
in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, which has undergone increasingly rapid
development over the past two decades. The town is named for an
important 13th-century Sufi leader whose shrine receives thousands of
visitors annually. We document the extent and effects of the last flash
flood (1996) from interviews, field measurement of flood debris, and
patterns in satellite imagery; these show the extent of new development
in flood-prone wadi floors and the potential risks to residents and
visitors in the absence of proper planning. We then recommend measures
to reduce the future loss of life and damage from flooding.

T1  - Frequency and seasonality of flash floods in Slovenia
A1  - Trobec, Tajan
Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assess and analyse the dynamics of flash
flooding events in Slovenia. The paper examines in particular the
frequency of flash floods and their seasonal distribution. The
methodology is based on the analysis of historical records and modern
flood data. The results of a long-term frequency analysis of 138 flash
floods that occurred between 1550 and 2015 are presented. Because of the
lack of adequate historical flood data prior to 1950 the main analysis
is based on data for the period between 1951 and 2015, while the
analysis of data for the period between 1550 and 1950 is added as a
supplement to the main analysis. Analysis of data for the period after
1950 shows that on average 1.3 flash floods occur each year in Slovenia.
The linear trend for the number of flash floods is increasing but is not
statistically significant. Despite the fact that the majority of
Slovenian rivers have one of the peaks in spring and one of the lows in
summer, 90% of flash floods actually occur during meteorological summer
or autumn -i.e. between June and November, which shows that discharge
regimes and flood regimes are not necessarily related. Because of the
lack of flood records from the more distant past as well as the large
variability of flash flood events in the last several decades, we cannot
provide a definitive answer to the question about possible changes in
their frequency and seasonality by relying solely on the detected
trends. Nevertheless, considering the results of analysis and future
climate change scenarios the frequency of flash floods in Slovenia could
increase while the period of flash flood occurrence could be extended.

AB  - Trees impacted by the forces of natural processes such as flash floods,
snow avalanches, landslides, rockfalls or earthquakes, record these
events and exhibit growth disturbances in their growth-ring series. As a
consequence, these disturbances provide an excellent signal for the
spatio-temporal reconstruction of past natural hazard activity and a
means to date and document past disasters. In the context of the Indian
Himalayas Climate Change Adaptation Programme (IHCAP;
http://www.ihcap.in/), a field trip was carried out in May 2014 to
define suitable sites for dendrogeomorphic research in Kullu valley,
Himachal Pradesh. Several tree species and sites where recent and past
process activity can be reconstructed were inventoried, namely flash
floods in the Beas and Sainj rivers as well as snow avalanches in Solang
valley. Through this exploratory analysis, we ascertain that tree-ring
techniques have wide applicability in the analysis of natural hazards,
not only in the Kullu region but also in other geographical contexts of
the Himalayas.

AB  - During the second half of 2010, the global climate system has been
affected by the presence of anomalous cold conditions in the tropical
Pacific related to a strong La Nina phenomenon, which continued
throughout the first half of 2011, and had a second pulse in the boreal
winter of 2011-2012. Climate patterns around the world were affected
causing marked anomalies and important socioeconomic impacts in
different countries. During this period, Colombia experienced a
hydroclimatic anomaly expressed in precipitation levels above normal and
extreme events such as flash floods, landslides, and long-term flooding
of plains in different regions of the country. Losses and damages to
infrastructure, crops, and livelihoods reached more than 7.8 billion US
dollars (approximately 2% of 2011 GDP). Due to the flooding of a vast
area, about 2,350,000 people were affected, and as consequence most of
them were expelled from their territories to live in alien territories
in very difficult conditions; in these areas, many social conflicts
either arose or worsened. Some of these conflicts are pointed out at the
end of this chapter with the aim that they may serve as lessons for
strengthening the regional disaster risk management for being better
prepared against adverse impacts of similar extreme events in the
future.

PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods represent very dynamical natural phenomenon. Mostly, they
are the result of torrential rains which can rise suddenly in any part
of a country and are tough to predict. Of course, there are many weather
forecasting systems, but their spatial and temporal resolution is
usually insufficient for these purposes. There are also monitoring
systems which can either register precipitation over the ground (a
network of rain gauge stations) or runoff in riverbeds (a network of
hydrometric stations). Again, spatial (and possibly temporal) resolution
is not sufficient, and in the case of runoff monitoring, there is a
substantial delay between actual rainfall and registration of runoff in
riverbeds. And, of course, when the hydrometric station registers higher
runoff than the flash floods is running or even over. From the point of
early warning, all these systems reveal disadvantages. Aside from these
systems, there is one which provides us with timely information about
the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation intensity over
the ground. That is weather radar. We will demonstrate possible usage of
these data for dynamic prediction of flash flood risk distribution in
space and time over the monitored area. Proper processing of these data
in combination with soil saturation indicator established using Flash
flood guidance methodology developed by the US Hydrologic Research
Center can generate timely information usable for early warning with a
substantially reduced level of false warnings.

The focus of this study is to analyze and understand the socioeconomic vulnerability of the community at the household level and to assess the risk and vulnerability of the community by risk assessment. All the tasks were performed to make a measure for community-based disaster risk reduction activities.

To analyze the degree of risk and vulnerability in landslide and flash flood-prone areas in Thepparat community, the risk assessment has been done acquiring the information from field survey, questionnaire survey, and key informant interviews. The risk analysis has been conducted by risk assessment matrix combined with geographic information system to analyze the spatial data and landslide and flash flood risk maps. The landslide factors developed from the Thai Department of Mineral Resource data have resulted in landslide susceptibility index. However, the community susceptible to flash floods has been identified by creating buffer zones in digital maps to explain the vulnerability and exposure of residents. In addition, the villages are also clustered into three zones as high-, moderate-, and low-risk zones. The study recommends the multihazard risk reduction measures based on the outcome of risk analysis of the community. The recommendations are primarily focused on the improvements of existing programs such as early warning system, local-level capacity development, and community training. The study also explored some of the nonstructural measures in the context of community-based disaster risk management, disaster management courses in school teaching, and community awareness to build a resilient community.; Miriam Nielsen (2019-08-22 22:55:53)(Screen): book chapter. here's a link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128120569000178;

resource engineering, water resources and engineering, groundwater,
geochemical engineering, environmental engineering, atmospheric
Sciences, Climate Change, and oceanography. Flash floods are one of the
major natural disasters that may hamper human development. The regional
division of flash floods is an effective non-engineering measure of
flood control and reduction. In the present study, the grey fuzzy
comprehensive evaluation method combined with the GIS technology are
proposed to establish the risk assessment model of flash floods, also a
reasonable index system of mountain flood risk assessment is
established. The proposed model is made at township level with much
higher resolution data, leading to a risk map of 1436 towns and counties
in Hubei Province for planning prevention and relief. Earlier work
conducted for the flood disaster risk zonation was commonly based on DEM
data and statistical yearbook data, selected the index such as the
impact of rainfall, topography, slope, river distribution factor with
analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method to determine the weight, finally
got the regional risk map by using ArcGIS map algebra superposition.
This method was simple and feasible, but not adequately reasonable. The
present study has taken into account remote sensing images such as river
network density, vegetation coverage and proportion of agricultural area
as well as historical flood disaster data. Results demonstrate that the
used approach of regional division is shown to be capable of planning
the dangerous areas, overcoming the limitation of the flash flood
assessment model, reducing the impact of flash floods and providing the
local residents with information about the risk of disasters.

AB  - In this study, the Akcay basin located in Western Black Sea Region was
divided into sub basins and the geometrical parameters of those sub
basins, the drainage network and the stream orders specified by the
Strahler method were determined by using ArcGIS 10.1.Thus, the
morphometric parameters of each sub basin were computed.Then, in order
to be able to evaluate the sub basins in terms of flood potential, a
prioritization method in the literature was adapted and with the usage
of the morphometric parameters the sub basins were graded according to
their flood potentials. According to the sub basin prioritization
carried out, it was determined that the reservoir of the Yunuslar HEPP
located in the Akcay basin enclosed the sub basin which had a high flood
potential and constituted approximately half of the total drainage area
of the basin. Furthermore, it was suggested that construction of a check
dam in the sub basin which has the largest drainage area and a river
bridge located at its outlet point would reduce the potential effect of
the flash flood for both the river bridge and the whole basin. The flash
flood potential of all sub basins was also investigated by using lesser
number of morphometric parameters according to a graphical method in the
literature and the flash flood potential of all sub basins was found to
be moderate according to this method.

AB  - Flash floods are very abrupt and sudden and can devastate large areas
with in fraction of seconds. Tsunami is also a grass root cause of
infrastructure loss and casualties. Tsunami is caused by the release of
energy inside the ocean. It has been observed that Tornados and Tsunami
frequently occurred that caused more than 120000 casualties between 1992
to 2005. Several approaches and cases have been studied and applied to
overcome this topmost issue. Strong and reliable flood risk management
system must have the capabilities to forecast and estimate the change in
the process: the hydro atmospheric and climatic development that causes
flood waves and land and metropolitan exposure that leads to casualties.
Techniques utilized for the early investigation of flash floods may be
classified into following categories a. Sensors and
instrumentation-based b. Radar based c. Satellite images based. In this
paper researchers presented a reliable and vigor cost-effective solution
for the prediction of flash floods accurately and precisely by using
direct measurements with the combination of scaled conjugate gradient
back propagation. Researchers have adopted direct measurement method by
utilizing couple of sensors named as PIR, ultrasonic sensor, water or
humidity sensor, temperature and pressure sensors. Gas sensor has also
been used to detect the increased carbon dioxide levels in the
environment as soil is saturated more and the probability of flash flood
occurrence becomes sure in this situation. An appropriate mixture of
estimation sensors can extensively boost the benefit of information in
contrast with that from a single sensor. 48 hours of data has been
recorded and processed for the false alarm identification by using
Scaled conjugate gradient back propagation. Results proved that our
proposed system worked better or equivalent to the other available
techniques with minimized error rate. Results showed that it performed
better than the existing approaches. Multi layer perceptron (MLP) was
applied on the same data set for the error and false alarm
classification. Results were compared with the multi-layer perceptron
and it can be easily observed that they are close enough therefore
scaled conjugate gradient back propagation performed very well.

AB  - Floods have always posed great threat to human settlements, and their
monitoring has always been a very important step in the understanding,
managing and predicting similar, future events, in order to mitigate
flood risk and the concrete impact it has on communities and the
environment. Modern techniques of analysing flood extent include remote
sensing, by extracting flood limits from satellite imagery, and
Geographical Information Systems (GIS), which are used in tandem, to
generate cartographic material, depicting areas suffering from flood
damage. Unfortunately, the results are not always precise, and can
induce significant errors, due to which, the results are questionable
and cannot be efficiently included in management plans, by authorities.
The current study addresses the validation process of digitally
generated GIS layers, based on statistical data derived from
hydrological field recordings, with satellite images that reveal the
proper flood extents, from the same time period, as the case study flash
flood. The emphasis was put on comparing absolute and relative accuracy
values, in order to validate several results, such as digital, HEC-RAS
generated water levels (based on statistical analysis) with recorded
water levels; 5% recurrence interval flood extents of HEC-RAS model,
correlated withreal-world flood extent, and through satellite imagery.

AB  - Floods affect road infrastructure physically and operationally, increase
road user costs and road agencies cost, and eventually isolate
communities. The research of the effect of floods on vehicular
circulation is mainly focused on the stability of vehicles. There are
few studies related to the regime of still water in the trafficability.
In still water, the speed flow is low and does not compromise the
vehicle stability. In this case, the vehicle's wading height becomes
relevant. This article proposes a procedure to estimate the traffic
interruption probability caused by floods in roads, considering the
still water regime. The procedure uses the first-order reliability
method to estimate traffic interruption probabilities, based on the
difference between the probability density functions (PDF) of still
water depth (or waterlogging depth) and vehicle wading height. A
specific procedure to estimate the PDF of wading height based in the
geometric characteristics of light and heavy vehicles was developed. The
PDF for water depth was estimated using water level profile simulation
software. The procedure was applied in the south of Chile. The PDF of
wading height was obtained from a record of 166,155 vehicles tagged in
open road tolls. The PDF of waterlogging depth was obtained from
discharge records of 10 fluviometric stations. 42 probability curves
were obtained for six vehicle classes and return periods between 4 and
500 years. The still water depth obtained for traffic interruption
probability of 1,0 varied between 70 and 90 cm for light vehicles and
between 110 and 150 cm for heavy vehicles.

AB  - Decision making in utilities, municipal, and energy companies depends on
accurate and trustworthy weather information and predictions. Recently,
crowdsourced personal weather stations (PWS) are being widely used to
provide a higher spatial and temporal resolution of weather
measurements. For instance, increasing attention is being paid to the
potential of PWS data to improve flash-flood assessment and prediction.
However, tools and methods to ensure the trustworthiness of the
crowdsourced data in real-time are largely missing. In this paper, we
present a Reputation System for Crowdsourced Rainfall Networks (RSCRN)
to assign trust scores to personal weather stations in a region. Using
real PWS data from the Weather Underground service in the high flood
risk region of Norfolk, Virginia, we validate the performance and
robustness of the proposed RSCRN. The proposed method is able to
converge to a confident trust score for a PWS within 10-20 observations
of installation and can robustly respond to any discrepancies in the
data due to failure or malicious intent. We benchmark the performance of
the proposed method with high-fidelity and trusted hydrological sensor
data, which are usually expensive to install. Collectively, the results
indicate that the trust score derived from the RSCRN can reflect the
collective measure of trustworthiness to the PWS, ensuring both useful
and trustworthy data for modeling and decision-making in the future.

AB  - Philippines suffer a great loss from typhoon damages and tons of natural
disasters that has negative impacts on the environment. Typhoon and
flash flood will reduce farm productivity by damaging farm inputs and
destroying establishment and infrastructure and prevent an increasing in
farm planting, these results in the worse condition in output and
productivity which will possibly harm by the country's food security,
economic losses, and income. One of the major reasons for this is
allocation of fund, the lack of knowledge and preparation of a citizens
and officials in agricultural damages and disaster prevention. This
concept paper focuses on giving knowledge and awareness by simulating
the damage of the typhoon in the Agricultural sector to help the
community and officials to visualize and know the risks and damages of
typhoon on the Agricultural when calamity occurs as well as to view the
damages on agriculture with interactive 3D simulation environment. The
proposed system can be develop using Simulation Methodology which
composes of several phases to achieved the agricultural disaster
simulation with the integration of Monte Carlo Algorithm, it can be used
to apply the parameters from PAGASA's storm warning signals for
simulation and typhoon parameters. The need for the development of this
system must be develop and implement for the benefits of the farmers,
agricultural sector, the people, and to the environment to prevent
possible damages and mitigate larger amount of losses in economic and
agriculture.

AB  - To the southern part of San Jose city, there is a mountainous ridge that
is the place where Aserri, Desamparados, Alajuelita, Escazu, Santa Ana,
and Mora cantons are settled. This area belongs to the old geological
formation where, due to the rain pattern, the relief is affected by high
weathering. This causes the presence of rugged hillsides. Since the
nineties and due to its historic and geographical proximity to the
central part of the country, this territory has been highly influenced
by population growth and urbanization. The unrestricted way in which the
population has occupied the land has caused landslides and flash floods.
These processes are related to the physic dynamic of high slope reliefs
and the way that many people are living over there.

PD  - 
AB  - During the past 20 years, there has been a rapid increase in tourism
development along the Red Sea coast of Egypt. In the resort of Hurghada,
for example, the number of hotel rooms increased from a few hundred in
1989 to 35 000 in 2004, and the entire Egyptian Red Sea coastline has
experienced growth. Accordingly, car and lorry traffic between the major
cities of Upper Egypt and the Red Sea coast along the El-Quseir-Qena
highway has increased tremendously. The road provides access to tourist
destinations and is an essential commuting route for workers. The
El-Quseir-Qena highway is subject to flash flooding, and several serious
traffic accidents have occurred during flash floods. Therefore, this
study performed an assessment of run-off water and sediment yield for
different parts of the El-Ambagi basin using the Hydrologic Modeling
System and the Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model. In addition, the
study aimed to determine the impacts of run-off water and sediment
yields on the El-Quseir-Qena highway. The study proposed possible
mitigation strategies for reducing flood risk and utilising the run-off
water to recharge the basin's alluvial, fractured-carbonate, and
fractured-basement aquifers.

AB  - The City of Kota Tinggi in Malaysia was under more than 5 m of water
during the floods in December 2006 and January 2007. The watershed
received between 280 and 530 mm of rain in 4 days. These extreme events
occurred 3 weeks apart and caused extensive damages. The application of
the fully distributed two-dimensional model two-dimensional runoff,
erosion and export (TREX) to simulate these events and the estimation of
the return period of such extreme events are the main objectives of this
study. The model performance was very good based on the relative
percentage different (3.7%), percent BIAS (overestimated the volume by
1.5%) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (0.8). The TREX model
is successful in simulating extreme flood events. The December 2006
rainstorm event at Kota Tinggi is extremely rare, and this multiday
rainstorm had an estimated return period greater than 2000 years. The
analysis of the return period shows that multiday rainstorms occur more
frequently than single-day events. In addition, we produce a flood
threshold graph by integrating both the hydrological modelling process
using TREX and the theoretical formulation of return period. The
proposed flood threshold graph is useful in the estimation of the amount
of accumulated rainfall from multiday rainfall that can cause flooding
on a large watershed like Kota Tinggi.

communication channels and tools selection by agencies in the
post-warning response phase of a disaster. The model, developed from
disaster and information seeking literature, attempts to predict
information source and channel selection by people after their community
has received a warning for a disaster. It provides the coding framework
for analysis of 51 semi structured interviews with disaster-affected
Australians. The interviews tested the model for accommodation of
channels and sources that people chose, found most useful, and used most
in bushfire, slow flood, flash flood, and cyclone situations. The order
of initial sources was investigated and preliminary information seeking
pathways established across disaster types. The disaster information
seeking model supports this investigation of information seeking
behaviour, though improvements are suggested. The resulting model could
guide agency response communication for different disaster types.

AB  - Flood hazard maps are one of the main components of any flood risk
management strategy. It is predicted that the degree of flood risk is
going to significantly increase in the future due to climatic and
environmental changes, and hence it is increasingly important that
state-of-the-art methods are implemented for assessing human stability
in floodwaters. Therefore, this paper focuses on proposing more accurate
and detailed guidelines for predicting flood hazard indices in small and
steep river basins or catchments, prone to the occurrence of flash
flooding. The results obtained in this study indicate that for river
basins with an average bed gradient greater than 1% (i.e. torrential or
flashy river basins or catchments), then the flood hazard indices should
be predicted using criteria which are based on the physical
interpretation of the processes that affect the human stability in
floodwaters, i.e. mechanics based and experimentally calibrated flood
hazard assessment methods.

AB  - This study characterizes significant changes in denudation and disasters
in mountainous areas induced in the humid Chengdu Longmenshan region by
the Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008. A study focusing on the Longxi-Baisha
River Basin was conducted to investigate the amount of denudation
triggered by specific flash flood and debris flow events in 2009-2014.
The following results were obtained through a comparison of pre-seismic
regional denudation rates and denudation characteristics of other
seismically active mountain regions. (1) Regional denudation processes
occurred in a wave-like process of initial increase then decline, with a
peak exhibiting a hyperbolic attenuation trend. This trend indicates
that the denudation rate in the Chengdu Longmenshan region is expected
to return to the pre-seismic rate of 0.3 mm a(-1) after 81 years. In 22
years after the earthquake (Year 2030), debris flow disasters are
expected to be rare. (2) Disasters increased significantly in the
Chengdu Longmenshan region after the Wenchuan earthquake, with an
average of 29.5 people missing or dead per year (22 times greater than
the pre-earthquake rate) and average economic losses of 192 million Yuan
per year (1.6 times greater than the pre-earthquake rate). (3) The
denudation process was jointly controlled by the quantities of loose
solid material and precipitation after the Wenchuan earthquake. The
amount of loose solid material influenced the extent of denudation,
while vegetation coverage rates and soil consolidation determined the
overall denudation trend in the region, and changes in precipitation led
to denudation fluctuations. (4) The results can be used to analyze the
relationship between the potential flash flood-debris flow disasters
after earthquakes in the ancient Shu kingdom and changes in historical
social settlements. The results can also be used to predict denudation
processes and disaster risks from earthquakes in humid mountainous
regions around the world, such as the southern slope of the Himalayas,
Japan and the Taiwan mountains. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Varinka stream. This study presents a reconstruction and post-event
analysis of a flash flood on small ungauged basin located in this
protected area of Slovakia. The reconstruction included hydraulic
terrain measurements on estimating the flood's culmination and
documenting the flood's development. The measurements were taken at
three cross sections of the Varinka stream. This paper is focused mainly
on post-event analysis of the Varinka stream in two profiles: Straza
(gauged profile) and TiesAavy (ungauged cross section). Subsequently,
the extremeness of the flash flood was preliminary evaluated. Results of
the post-event analysis showed that the July 2014 flood was not the
highest flood in this area despite its catastrophic consequences. By
studying historical materials, we came to the conclusion that in the
past (e.g. in 1848 or 1939) some devastating floods in this area had
occurred, which had disastrous consequences for the population. The
second part of the study is focused on comparing this flash flood with
three major floods which have occurred in Slovak territory since 1998.
The first flood occurred on the 20th of July, 1998 on the Mala Svinka
stream, and the two others are floods which occurred on the 7th of June,
2011 in the Small Carpathian Mountains: on the Gidra stream in Pila
village and on the Parna stream in Horn, Oreany village. Such comparison
of flash floods from different geographical regions and different
rainfall events can provide comprehensive information about their
regimes, threats and disastrous effects.

AB  - Flash floods induced by heavy rainfall occur frequently in China, which
cause severe damages or even casualties every year. Flash floods
generally occur in small catchments, and therefore were poorly
documented. A Database including 963 flash flood events in China is
compiled and studied in this study. Analytical results (a) indicate
flash flood condition in China; (b) shed light on the spatial-temporal
distribution of flash flood under heavy rainfall and (c) detect the
characteristics of the 2016 flash flood. In 2016, the deaths due to
flash floods were severe and concentrated, accounting for about half of
the elderly and children. Hebei and Fujian provinces were most affected
by flash floods. The disasters mainly occurred in July and the major
types were river floods. Despite the frequent torrential rains,
inadequate monitoring and early warning systems made the flash flooding
condition even worse in 2016.

PD  - 
AB  - On the morning of 18 September 2017, the center of the city of Elblag in
northern Poland was inundated by the rapidly rising waters of the
Kumiela River, resulting in considerable damage and chaos in the city.
The present paper provides information about this event, which was
caused by intense precipitation lasting two days. We put this individual
event in perspective by examining the climate track in the observation
and projection of flood hazard through analyzing changes in temperature,
precipitation and intense precipitation. We also examine the
non-climatic factors of flood risk, such as spatial development and
river regulation. Further, we pose the question of whether actions aimed
at flood risk reduction, predominantly by way of structural defenses in
the catchment of the Kumiela River, really reduce the flood risk in
Elblag. We also offer more general remarks pertaining to flood risk
reduction in Poland, primarily based on technical measures, and we
unveil the shortcomings of the current flood risk management system in
Poland. In the social consciousness, the structural flood defense
strategy has become the norm of thinking in terms of methods for
reducing the effects of floods in Poland, but this does not always
contribute to reducing flood damage either locally or nationally. We
refer to some good examples of preparedness for urban inundations caused
by heavy precipitation in other cities.

PD  - 
AB  - Two dimensional flood inundation models capable of simulating complex
spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are routinely
used to model and predict flooding. However, advances in modelling
techniques have not been matched by improvements in model validation.
Validation of flood models remains challenging due to a lack of
available spatially-explicit data; traditionally measured data and
validation approaches reveal little about the ability of a model to
simulate the complex dynamics of floodplain flows, including the
pathways, timeline, and impacts of an event. In this paper we propose a
novel method for the validation of hydraulic models of flooding using
quantitative and qualitative Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI).
This method uses VGI data to enhance traditionally measured validation
data by reconstructing the observed dynamics of a flood, allowing
validation of the temporal and spatial simulation of these dynamics. We
illustrate the method using a case study from Corbridge in the northeast
of England, using VGI collected through participatory research with
people affected by severe flooding in 2015. The results of the study
demonstrate that VGI data can be used for the effective reconstruction
of flood event dynamics. The results also reveal that the proposed
validation approach is able to identify underperformance in the model's
simulation of event dynamics not evaluated by standard global
performance measures. Such a lack of evaluation can have adverse
consequences where dynamic model outputs are used locally to influence
floodplain management. As a result, we propose a new framework for model
validation, adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to examining
event dynamics using a diverse range of data.

AB  - The Portaine mountain catchment, containing the Port Aine ski resort
(Lleida, Spanish Pyrenees), displays active erosional and depositional
phenomena caused by periodic torrential floods. These events present a
potential risk and incur significant economic losses. In ungauged remote
catchments (like Portaine), trees might be the only paleohydrological
source of information regarding past floods. Thus, we estimated the
temporal and spatial distribution of torrential floods by
dendrogeomorphological techniques to assess whether human impact
(land-use changes and infrastructure works) affected their frequency
andmagnitude. One-hundred and sixty-six samples from 67 trees belonging
to 10 different species were analyzed; past flood events of the last 50
years were identified by dating and relating evidence between them.
Moreover, a detailed geomorphological study was performed and the
available historical data compiled. Our multi-evidence analysis provides
new insight into the occurrence of paleofloods. Changes in flood
frequency since 2006, especially from 2008, suggest that the
geomorphological equilibrium has been disturbed, coinciding with both
major earthworks within the ski resort and intense but not extraordinary
rainfall. This conclusion has important implications for land planning
and the design of future projects in the mountain watersheds.

AB  - In a globally warming world, subtropical regions are generally expected
to become drier while the tropics and mid-high latitudes become wetter.
In line with this, Southwest China, close to 25A degrees N, is expected
to become increasingly prone to drought if annual mean precipitation
decreases. However, despite this trend, changes in the temporal
distribution of moisture supply might actually result in increased
extreme rainfall in the region, whose climate is characterized by
distinct dry and wet seasons. Using hourly and daily gauge observations,
rainfall intensity changes since 1971 are examined for a network of 142
locations in the region. From the analysis, dry season changes are
negligible but wet season changes exhibit a significantly strong
downward trend {[}-2.4% (10 yr)(-1)], particularly during the past 15
years {[}-17.7% (10 yr)(-1)]. However, the intensity of events during
the wettest of 5% hours appears to steadily increase during the whole
period {[}1.4% (10 yr)(-1)], tying in with government statistical
reports of recent droughts and flooding. If the opposing trends are a
consequence of a warming climate, it is reasonable to expect the
contradictory trend to continue with an enhanced risk of flash flooding
in coming decades in the region concerned.

AB  - Flash floods represent one of the more usual natural hazards in mountain
basins, and, combined with the lack of reliable flow data and the
recreational use of the drainage basin by tourists and hikers, there is
a significant risk of catastrophe. Here, we present a
dendro-geomorphological reconstruction of a past flash flood event in
the Caldera de Taburiente N.P. (Canary Islands, Spain), an ungauged
drainage basin in the SW side of the volcanic island of La Palma. We
couple two-dimensional hydraulic modelling in a highly-resolved
topographic environment (LiDAR data) with (1) peak flow data for various
T-year return periods from an uncalibrated hydrological model and (2) a
data set of scars on trees, to investigate the magnitude of a 1997 dated
flash-flood. From the results, flood hazards and associated risks would
be clearly underestimated by using only the unique available
hydrological data (a rainfall gauge station downstream of the study
area). Hydraulic models using scars data show a higher flood hazard
scenario, improving the flood hazard map by using all available flood
evidence. Moreover, all this will allow for better implementation of
appropriate adaptation policies by National Park managers, and therefore
the mitigation of future disasters.

AB  - A water resources index based on weight-accumulated precipitation over
the passage of time in heavy rainfall events is used in this study for
monitoring flood risk and peak danger, as well as to develop flood
warnings. In this research, an hourly water resources index (WRI (hr))
based on rainfall accumulations over the passage of time is proposed.
WRI (hr) is able to monitor flood risk by taking into account the hourly
effective precipitation that accumulates the precipitation (P (hr)) of
both current and antecedent hours, while the contributions from the
preceding hours is subjected to a time-dependent reduction function that
addresses the depletion of water volume by various hydrological
processes (e.g., discharge, runoff, evapotranspiration). By converting
rainfall into a water resources index (WRI), the hourly precipitation
over a 24-h period is redistributed to formulate a long-term water
resources index (WRI (hr-L)) that monitors flood status based on
long-term (more than 1 year) fluctuations in P (hr) and a short-term
water resources index (WRI (D-hr-S)) that considers shorter (D = 24-148
hourly) accumulations of the P (hr) data. WRI was assessed for its
potential in flood monitoring at two hydrologically diverse sites:
Dobong (South Korea; August 1998) and Brisbane (Australia; December
2010-January 2011), and its applicability was verified using river water
level (H) measurements at hydrological stations. The power spectrum
density and spectral coherence of hourly rainfall, river water level,
and the corresponding WRI showed good agreements, as did the low and
high frequency wavelet components using the discrete wavelet transform
algorithm. Importantly, WRI (24-hr-S) computed over 24 hourly
accumulation periods was able to mimic the risk of short-term
(flash-style) floods caused by concentrated rainfall, whereas WRI (hr-L)
was more useful for flood risk assessment caused by an event over a
long-term period. Dynamical changes in H were closely in-phase with the
patterns of change noted in the WRI (hr) over the respective temporal
scale. We conclude that the proposed WRI was able to replicate the flood
evolution over the passage of time and, therefore, could possibly aid in
the early warning of water-related disasters, demonstrating its
practicality for continuous monitoring of the flood risk when a
sustained period of rainfall event is observed.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - The assessment of hydrometeorological hazards in the mountainous area of
Southwestern Sinai area (SWSA) necessitates reliable and accurate
information about natural hazards, especially flash floods. Flash floods
are the main dangerous hazards that threaten lives and any sustainable
development planning in and around the rugged topography areas. The SWSA
receives occasional heavy rainstorms every two or four years, triggering
destructive floods that runoff towards the Gulf of Suez. The present
study aims to extract, evaluate, integrate and map the potential flash
flood hazards by applying remote sensing, GIS tools and by statistically
analyzing the geomorphometric parameters. Moreover, assessing the flash
flood hazard risk ranks was carried for the three main basins (W. Baba,
W. Sidri, and W. Nukhul). The drainage networks and basins were
extracted from DEM then, delineated into seventy-two sub-basins and then
the morphometric parameters of these sub-basins were estimated. The
analysis of the various morphometric parameters of the three main basins
shows that they have different effects on flash flood hazards. Depending
on the statistical analysis of the commutative weights of the important
geomorphometric parameters and GIS functions; the studied basins were
categorized into three risk ranks; namely: high, moderate and low flash
flood risk. The integration of the different controlling parameters
revealed that the zones of high flash flood hazard risk are
characterized by the low probability of groundwater recharge which
should be put into consideration to help the decision makers avoid risks
which are considered to be one of the most dangerous obstacles to the
sustainable development of the study area.

PD  - 
AB  - Urban underground facilities tend to be vulnerable to flood that is
generated by the breaking of a dam or a levee, or a flash flood after an
exceptional rainfall. Rapid and dynamic assessment of underground flood
evolution process is of great significance for safety evacuation and
disaster reduction. Taking advantage of the Delphi method to determine
the Bayesian conditional probabilities collected by expert knowledge,
this paper proposes an integrated Bayesian Network (BN) framework for
rapidly and dynamically assessing the flood evolution process and
consequences in underground spaces. The proposed BN framework, including
seventeen nodes, can represent the flood disaster drivers, flood
disaster bearers, flood mitigation actions, and on-site feedback
information. Given evidences to specific nodes, the risk distribution of
typical flood scenarios can be quantitatively estimated. The results
indicate that the proposed framework can be useful for dynamically
evaluating underground flood evolution process and identifying the
critical influencing factors. This BN-based framework is helpful for
Scenario-Response-based predictive analyses to support decision that is
related to flood disaster emergency response.

AB  - An integrated hydrological-hydraulic model employing the 2-D local
inertial equation as the core is established for effective numerical
simulation of surface water flows in a great lake and its floodplain.
The model is a cascade of validated hydrological and hydraulic
sub-models. The model was applied to simulating the surface water flows
of the Tonle Sap Lake and its floodplain in Cambodia using the roughness
coefficient value calibrated comparing with a remote-sensing data set.
The resulting model reasonably handles backwater flows during the rainy
season and simulates the propagations of wet and dry interfaces without
numerical instability, owing to a proper setting of time step supported
by a novel numerical stability analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the
surface water dynamics focusing on the setting of roughness coefficient
and the backwater effect was also carried out. Overall, utilizing the
2-D local inertial equation in the assessment of lake water dynamics is
a new modelling approach, which turns out to be an efficient simulation
tool.

AB  - On 22nd November 2011, after extreme rainfall (more than 350 mm fell in
10 h), thousands of shallow landslides evolving into debris flows
occurred in several torrent catchments of Peloritani ridge, northeastern
Sicily, carrying a large amount of wood. A rapid increase in torrent
discharge occurred during the storm, inducing floods of the Longano and
Mela torrents, also amplified by wood obstructions of bridges. A
detailed reconstruction of the main geo-hydrological events has been
done. Landslides have been mapped by satellite photos and checked by
field surveys, and were found to be particularly concentrated in the
Longano, Mela and Saponara catchments. The timing of landslide
initiation has been estimated by technical report data, eyewitnesses,
and by calibration of the Leaky Barrel Model {[}Wilson, Wiezoreck,
Environ Eng Geosci 1(1):11-27, 1995]. The recorded amount of rainfall
has been transformed into the torrent discharge by the HEC-HMS model,
using a detailed digital elevation model (DEM) with resolution of 2 x 2
m, and the torrent hydrograph has been obtained corresponding to several
river sections. In the urban area of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, the
torrent discharge reached its peak before the arrival of the large
trunks, indicating that the main cause of the inundation in the urban
area was the bridge obstruction. The aim of this study is to provide a
detailed case history of landslides inducing floods, and their
relationship with the use of simple hydrological models, which could
help in estimating the risk of inundation caused by a large amount of
wood in unmonitored catchments.

AB  - Flood mitigation involves the management and control of floodwater
movement, such as redirecting flood runoff through the use of floodwalls
and flood gates, rather than trying to prevent floods altogether. The
prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on
individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities. The
current study area is located in Hurghada on the Red Sea, which is
considered an important area for coastal tourism. The study area is
located at distance 7.50 km from El Gouna city along the Red Sea and
east of Hurghada-Al Ismaileya road. The aim of this research is to
derive the runoff flow paths across the study area and their flow
magnitudes under different rainfall events of 10, 25, 50, and 100 year
return periods in order to design the flood mitigation measures to
protect such important areas. Field data (e.g., topographic data and
rainfall intensities) were collected for the study area. The results
indicated that the site is exposed to high flash flood risk and
protection work is required. In order to protect the area from flood
risks, locations of number of drainage channels and dams were selected
and designed based on flood quantity and direction. The proposed
mitigation system is capable of protecting this crucial area from flood
risks and increases the national income from tourism. This study can be
applied in different areas of Egypt and the world.

PD  - 
AB  - Flood susceptibility in the Lower Connecticut River Valley Region
attributable to nonclimatic flood risk factors is mapped using a
quantitative method using logistic regression. Flood risk factors
considered include elevation, slope, curvature (concave, convex, or
flat), distance to water, land cover, vegetative density, surficial
materials, soil drainage, and impervious surface. Values of factors at
point locations were correlated to whether a location was located within
or outside of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). The Lower Connecticut River Valley
Region was divided into urban, rural, and coastal subregions to assess
the differences in factor contributions to flood susceptibility between
different region types; for each region flood risk factors were
extracted from 4,000 points, of which an equal number were within or
outside of the 100-year SFHA. Logistic regression coefficients were
obtained. It was found that elevation and distance to water have the
greatest contribution to flood susceptibility in the urban and coastal
subregions, whereas distance to water and surficial materials dominate
in the rural subregion. The contribution of land use to flood
susceptibility increased by over 200% between the rural and urban
regions. Probabilities of flooding were computed using each regional
logistic regression equation. Several areas classified as very high risk
(80-100%) and high risk (60-80%) were located outside of the SFHA and
included several types of infrastructure critical for human health,
safety, and education. This study demonstrates the utility of logistic
regression as an efficient methodology to map regional flood
susceptibility.
Plain Language Summery Flooding is one of the most severe and
potentially devastating natural disasters that can occur. Floods can
come in many forms, including river, coastal, and flash flooding.
Whenever and wherever any of these types of flooding occur, long-term
planning and adaptation, preparedness, and response time are all
critical factors in reducing the overall impacts. Awareness of areas
that are currently prone and will remain prone to flooding in the future
is essential to consider in both short-term and long-term planning. Such
awareness comes from an understanding of a combination not only of
regional climatic factors but also of nonclimate factors that relate to
natural, physical, and development characteristics. The current study
estimates the risk of flooding throughout the Lower Connecticut River
Valley Region (LCRVR) based on site and regional characteristics not
related to climate. Several methods were considered to estimate flood
risk; the method that was finally selected for this study involves a
statistical approach in which a data set having one or more independent
variables that produce a binary value of no or yes (0 or 1,
respectively) for the dependent variable is analyzed. The independent
variables in this case include several nonclimate factors related to
flood risk that could potentially affect the region and for which
sufficient data were available and are referred to as flood risk
factors. Flood risk factors considered include elevation, land slope,
land curvature (concave, convex, or flat), distance to water body, land
cover, density of vegetation, surface geology, ability of the soil to
drain water, and the percent of impervious surface (e.g., pavement). The
objective is to link each of the flood risk factors to the dependent
variables, which in this case is the occurrence of flooding for a flood
event that is estimated to occur on average once in every 100 years. It
was found that the overall quality of recent satellite images of the
LCRVR during large flood events was not sufficient for the current
analysis; therefore, it was decided to use the U.S. Federal Emergency
Management Agency 100-year Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) to indicate
areas where flood inundation would occur. The advantage of using the
SFHA and the selected statistical modeling methodology is that they
allow the contribution of each flood risk factor within the SFHA to be
estimated and then applied to the entire study region to identify
additional areas outside of the SFHA that have high flood risk. The
LCRVR was divided into three subregions (urban, rural, and coastal) to
accentuate the differences in the contributions of each flood risk
factor to flood risk between an urban and a rural area and between
inland and coastal areas; for each subregion 4,000 point locations were
randomly chosen from which to extract data for each flood risk factor.
An equal number of these points were selected in locations that were
within and outside of the SFHA for each subregion. Site data for each
flood risk factor were extracted and associated with a 1 if the location
was within the SFHA and a 0 otherwise. The resulting relations between
each flood risk factor and flood occurrence were analyzed so that
regression coefficients could be estimated for each factor, the
magnitude of which indicates the relative strength of each flood risk
factor's influence on flooding in a subregion.
It was found that elevation and distance to water have the most
influence on flood risk in the urban and coastal subregions, whereas
distance to water and surface geology dominate in the rural subregion.
The contribution of elevation and land use were also found to increase
the most between the rural and urban subregions. The coefficients for
each subregion are then used to assign probabilities of flooding to all
locations over a grid covering that subregion. The results for each
subregion were combined to create an overall flood probability map of
the LCRVR. Probabilities were classified very low risk (0-20%), low
risk (20-40%), medium risk (40-60%), high risk (60-80%), and very
high risk (80-100%). It was observed that several areas classified as
very high risk and high risk were located outside of the SFHA. Several
types of infrastructure critical for human health, safety, and education
were finally overlaid on the flood risk map to identify those assets
that are most vulnerable to the 100-year flood and may therefore require
additional flood risk mitigation.

T1  - Fuzzy Rule-Based Assessment of Runoff for Abha, Saudi Arabia, Using the Watershed Modeling System (WMS) Software

PD  - 
AB  - The arid and semi-arid countries often experience floods due to
torrential rainfall events. Appropriate strategy to collect and store
rainwater and surface runoff can augment water resources in these
countries. In Saudi Arabia, a total of 449 dams with capacity of 2017
million m(3) are available to control floods, recharge aquifers and to
supply for domestic and agricultural applications. The southwestern
region of the country experiences flash floods, indicating the scope of
water resources augmentation through runoff collection. In this study,
location of a new dam was identified in Abha, Saudi Arabia, using the
watershed modeling system (WMS) software. The WMS software and HEC-HMS
hydrologic model were used to delineate watershed and to quantify
runoff. The fuzzy rule-based modeling approach was applied to
incorporate uncertainty. This study demonstrates that the rainfall
events of 25-, 50- and 100-year return periods can generate surface
runoff of 10.18 (range 1.77-22.24), 13.08 (range 2.91-26.94) and 16.09
(range 4.25-31.62) million m(3), respectively. Use of runoff from these
events can save US$ 0.94-35.4, 1.5-42.8 and 2.3-50.3 million,
respectively, which can also reduce CO2 emission by 24.6-346.9,
40.5-420.3 and 59.1-493.3 million kg, respectively.

PD  - 
AB  - The 2008 Wenchuan Ms 8.0 earthquake caused severe destruction in the
mountainous areas of Sichuan Province, China. Landslips and mass
movements led to substantial amounts of loose sediment accumulating in
valleys that subsequently led to widespread riverbed aggradation. In
addition to erosion and deposition hazards, this aggradation produced
rivers in earthquake affected areas that were more susceptible to flash
floods under extreme rainfall events. However, fluvial processes and
sediment movement after a major earthquake, as well as the re-working of
sediments in future events, are not well studied. In this paper, we
investigate the response of sediment and river channel evolution due to
different rainfall scenarios after the Wenchuan earthquake by using the
CAESAR-Lisflood model. This is the first time that this landscape
evolution model has been employed to explore material migration
processes in a post-earthquake area, and to test its applicability to
real landform changes in the studied catchment. The CAESAR-Lisflood
model is well suited to simulate sediment movement, particularly the
fluvial processes driven by severe rainfall after an earthquake. We
calibrated the model parameters to the 2013 extreme rainfall event using
high-resolution satellite images. Under rainfall scenarios of different
intensity and frequency over a 10-yr period, landform evolution and
sediment migration in the post-earthquake area were simulated. The
results showed that the sediment yield could be significantly increased
under enhanced and intensified rainfall scenarios compared to a normal
rainfall scenario. These findings are of importance for the planning of
post-earthquake rehabilitation and regional sustainable development,
which considers risk prevention and mitigation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Design flood estimation is very important for hydraulic structure
design, reservoir operation, and water resources management. During the
last few decades, severe flash floods have caused substantial human,
agricultural, and economic damages in Pakistan during the Monsoon
seasons. However, despite phenomenal losses, the flood characteristics
are rarely investigated. In this paper, flood frequency analysis (FFA)
on four major rivers over Pakistan is performed to probe probability
distributions (PDs)at the right-tail flood events. For this purpose, (i)
we employed ten different probability distributions associating with an
L-moments method for constructing FFA models across Pakistan; (ii) we
evaluated the best-fit distribution by using goodness-of-fit test and
statistical criteria; and finally; (iii) we devised a Monte Carlo
simulation to systematically evaluate the robustness of a selected
distribution's fitting performance by using a synthetic data series of
different sizes. Our results indicated that generalized Pareto and
Weibull emerged as the most viable options for quantifying hydrological
quantiles for most of the river basins in Pakistan. Our main findings
would provide rich information as references for flood risk assessment
and water resource management in Pakistan.

AB  - Storm events and accompanying heavy rain endanger the silty soils of the
fertile and intensively-used agricultural landscape of the Saxon loess
province in the European loess belt. In late spring 2016, persistent
weather conditions with repeated and numerous storm events triggered
flash floods, landslides, and mud flows, and caused severe devastation
to infrastructure and settlements throughout Germany. In Saxony, the
rail service between Germany and the Czech Republic was disrupted twice
because of two mud flows within eight days. This interdisciplinary study
aims to reconstruct the two mud flows by means of high-resolution
physical erosion modeling, high-resolution, radar-based precipitation
data, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle monitoring. Therefore,
high-resolution, radar-based precipitation data products are used to
assess the two storm events which triggered the mud flows in this
unmonitored area. Subsequently, these data are used as meteorological
input for the soil erosion model EROSION 3D to reconstruct and predict
mud flows in the form of erosion risk maps. Finally, the model results
are qualitatively validated by orthophotos generated from images from
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle monitoring and Structure from Motion
Photogrammetry. High-resolution, radar-based precipitation data reveal
heavy to extreme storm events for both days. Erosion risk maps show
erosion und deposition patterns and source areas as in reality,
depending on the radar-based precipitation product. Consequently,
reconstruction of the mud flows by these interdisciplinary methods is
possible. Therefore, the development of an early warning system for soil
erosion in agricultural landscapes by means of E 3D and high-resolution,
radar-based precipitation forecasting data is certainly conceivable.

AB  - This study examines the spatiotemporal evolution of China's flash flood
disasters (FFDs) since 1949 and explores driving factors affecting the
spatial distribution of historical FFDs. Records of more than 60000 FFDs
are examined, and the centroid comparison method is used to reveal the
spatiotemporal evolution of FFDs from 1951 to 2015. In particular, the
geographical locations of the centroids, degrees of aggregation, and
associated movement tendencies are examined to conduct a preliminary
analysis of correlations between rainfall, population, and the
spatiotemporal evolution of FFDs. Subsequently, using relevant data from
2000 to 2015, three factors relating to FFDs in natural watershed units
include namely rainfall, human activity, and the environment of the
Earth's surface. The geographical detector method is then employed to
explore the effect of these driving factors on the spatial distribution
of FFDs. Analysis results show that displacement of the spatial
distribution of FFDs since 1949 is correlated with variations in
rainfall and population distribution. In addition, it is determined that
the distribution of FFDs occurring between 2000 and 2015 have regional
differentiation characteristics. However, the effect of rainfall on the
distribution of FFDs is more significant than that of human activity or
the environment of the Earth's surface, but interactions occur between
these latter two factors in disaster-formative environments.
Furthermore, results also show that the driving factors of FFDs have
significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In China, regions at high risk
of FFDs include the Sichuan-Chongqing ecological zone, the South China
ecological zone, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, while regions with a low risk of FFDs
include the Northwest China arid zone, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Inner
Mongolian Plateau, and the Northeast China ecological zone. These
findings support further studies investigating disaster-formative
environments, facilitate FFD risk zoning, and provide a scientific basis
for plans to effectively prevent and control FFDs.

AB  - Seasonal and annual extreme precipitation over the Peruvian Andes have
been mapped for the first time. Maps were developed using the most
complete, quality-controlled and homogenous daily precipitation records
in Peru from 1973 to 2016. For each observed rain gauge series, we
defined parameters as the de-clustered daily intensity, total
precipitation duration, total magnitude and dry-spell length. Then, we
fitted the seasonal and annual series of these variables to a
Generalized-Pareto distribution using a peak-over-threshold approach. We
estimated the distribution parameters and validated the performance of
different thresholds to obtain the best estimation of precipitation
probability. We also mapped the distribution parameters obtained for the
different meteorological stations using the universal kriging algorithm,
accounting for elevation and the distance to the Pacific Ocean as
co-variables. The accuracy of the extreme precipitation maps for a
period of 25 and 50 years were validated using a jack-knife approach.
Some of the maps show strong uncertainty given the random spatial
distribution of the variables as a consequence of the complex topography
and climate of the region. Nevertheless, the maps show a useful general
assessment of the spatial distribution of the precipitation hazard
probability over the region, providing a good agreement with the
estimations obtained in the meteorological stations for some variables
and time periods analysed. Extreme precipitation maps over this
high-complex terrain of Peru are of key importance for flood risk
assessment, water resources management, crop yield, soil conservation
and human settlements.

AB  - With deterioration of the global climate situation, the frequency and
uncertainty of typhoons are the major causes of their hazards in
tropical coastal regions, both in terms of loss of life and economic
damage. Heavy rainfall triggers massive landslides and devastating flash
floods, which can entail tremendous damage. In typhoon-affected areas,
the key issue is to estimate the disaster zone and to help ships avoid
disaster areas in the sea. Existing studies on typhoon disasters are
mainly based on the overall wind assessment or the route prediction of
the typhoon, with less attention to the detailed impact in different
regions along the route. We propose in this paper a new framework to
assess regional disaster risk based on chlorophyll-a concentration
inversion in seawater. To calculate the concentration of chlorophyll-a,
we analyze Landsat-8 satellite images in typhoon weather and normal
weather in the same area. The experiments on realistic samples show that
our approach has major potential to improve safety via assessing the
impact of a typhoon in different regions based on the level of
chlorophyll-a concentration.

human activities and development planning held along the eastern coastal
stretch of the Gulf of Suez. Change detection technique was used in
combined with geologic and topographic maps, GIS and field
investigations to specify and categorize environmental hazards along the

resources, including hot vents in Hammam Faroun and Ayun Mousa, oil
exploration and mineral deposits in W. Araba, W. Sidri and Ras Malaab,
natural protectorates in Ras Mohamed and archaeological sites in W.
Sidri, W. Feiran, El-Qaa' and coastal areas between W. Feiran and El-Tor
and between W. Araba and Ayun Mousa. This encourages the construction of
extensive and diverse economic activities such as urbanization,
industrial and tourism projects. However, this area subjected natural
hazards, including flash floods, mass movement, coastal erosion and sand
encroachment. Risk assessment maps for roads and urban sites were
established. The eastern coastal zone of the Gulf of Suez was classified
into four sectors; Sudr, Ras Malaab, Bilaiyim and El-Tor coastal plains.
Each sector is characterized by specific natural resources controlled by
environmental hazards. This provides the end users and decision makers
with necessary information required to design the most appropriate
development projects at each sector and mitigate the environmental risk
for the natural resources and natural development.

AB  - More than 75% of Colombia's 42 million people live in urban areas
located in the mountains and are exposed to numerous natural hazards:
floods, flash floods, landslides, earthquakes and volcanism. The Armero
disaster of 1985 triggered the creation of the National System for
Disaster Prevention and Relief. National, regional and local committees
started to operate across the country, accompanied by education
commissions that produced diverse audiovisual materials to help educate
people living in these areas. The experiences of working with local
committees gained during the last two decades are presented here. Case
histories are from cities such as Pereira, Manizales and Medellin, where
the local committees are run by people with little or no formal
education but who understand that they must participate as a group to
prevent or mitigate the effects of natural disasters. The co-operation
between technical experts and trained residents represents an
outstanding example of good communication and co-operation for urban
populations living in dangerous areas. Although many problems have yet
to be resolved, these case histories show that this type of organization
seems to be more effective than direct intervention from national
government agencies. The models of community participation and
communication developed and refined here may have application to similar
social environments in other countries.

T1  - Flood Risk Assessment in Coastal Drainage Basins through a Multivariate Analysis within a GIS-Based Model
A1  - de Gouveia Souza, C R
Y1  - 2009///
PD  - 
AB  - This paper presents a GIS-based multicriteria flood risk assessment and
mapping approach applied to coastal drainage basins where hydrological
data are not available. It involves risk to different types of possible
processes: coastal inundation (storm surge), river, estuarine and flash
flood, either at urban or natural areas, and fords. Based on the causes
of these processes, several environmental indicators were taken to
build-up the risk assessment. Geoindicators include
geological-geomorphologic proprieties of Quaternary sedimentary units,
water table, drainage basin morphometry, coastal dynamics, beach
morphodynamics and microclimatic characteristics. Bioindicators involve
coastal plain and low slope native vegetation categories and two
alteration states. Anthropogenic indicators encompass land use
categories properties such as: type, occupation density, urban structure
type and occupation consolidation degree. The selected indicators were
stored within an expert Geoenvironmental Information System developed
for the State of Sao Paulo Coastal Zone (SIIGAL), which attributes were
mathematically classified through deterministic approaches, in order to
estimate natural susceptibilities (Sn), human-induced susceptibilities
(Sa), return period of rain events (Ri), potential damages (Dp) and the
risk classification (R), according to the equation R=(Sn.Sa.Ri).Dp.
Thematic maps were automatically processed within the SIIGAL, in which
automata cells ({''}geoenvironmental management units{''}) aggregating
geological-geomorphologic and land use/native vegetation categories were
the units of classification. The method has been applied to the Northern
Littoral of the State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) in 32 small drainage basins,
demonstrating to be very useful for coastal zone public politics, civil
defense programs and flood management.

AB  - A GIS-based method for predicting the spatial and temporal
characteristics of flash floods in ungauged area is proposed in this
paper. The critical rainfall method is used to carry on temporal
prediction for flash floods. First in basins with raingauges, the
critical rainfall is estimated by analyzing rainfall records; in
ungauged basins with investigated disaster records, however, it is
supposed that the occurrence frequency of natural disasters and that of
rainfall are the same, and the critical rainfall is verified by
surveying the occurrence frequency of disasters; then the Inverse
Distance Weighted interpolation method is used to map the critical
rainfall and derive certain critical values of rainfall in ungauged
basins. In order to carry on spatial prediction, the modified rational
formula method is adopted to calculate the design flash flood of
ungauged basins first. Genetic Algorithm is used to search for the
parameters (n(1),n(2),u,m) in gauged basins. Geostatistic analysis
module in ArcGIS is used to map storm parameters
n(1)\textbackslash{}n(2). Regression analysis method is used to get the
empirical relationship between u and theta and that between m and theta.
Finally in ungauged basins, by using the map to confirm
n(1)\textbackslash{}n(2), by using the empirical formula to get m and u,
the design flash flood can be calculated with the rational formula. With
contour map and simple hydraulic method, flash flood disaster risk map
can be drawn out. It has been applied to Urumchi region successfully.

efforts. These discrepancies can have major economic effects on, for
example, investment potential and insurance factors. Thus, hazards must
be more accurately defined and risk assessments must be based on

AB  - Flooding occurred across a large area of southern and central Queensland
in December 2010 and January 2011. Intense rainfall over the Gowrie
Creek catchment caused severe flash flooding through the Toowoomba CBD
(Central Business District) on the afternoon of Monday, 10 January 2011,
taking lives and damaging the community. Flash floods are sudden and
unexpected floods that arise from intense rainfall, generally over a
small, steep catchment area. Smaller and steeper catchments have shorter
critical storm duration, and they respond more quickly to rainfall
events. The resulting flood wave is characterized by very high water
flows and velocities and abrupt water level rises, leading to extremely
hazardous conditions. Effective flash flood forecasting for specific
locations is a big challenge because of the behaviour of intense
thunderstorms. A flash flood forecasting and warning system calls for
accurate spatial information on catchment characteristics. A
high-resolution DEM is a key spatial dataset for the characterization of
a catchment to design possible flood mitigation measures.
The characteristics of a catchment have a strong influence on its
hydrological response. The nature of floods is dependent on both the
intensity and duration of the rainfall and the catchment characteristics
such as catchment area, drainage patterns and waterway steepness.
Therefore, analysis of catchment characteristics is critical for
hydrologic modelling and planning for flood risk mitigation. The
analysis of catchment characteristics can support hydrological modelling
and planning for flood risk mitigation. For example, the shape indices
of sub-catchments can be used to compare the hydrological behaviour of
different sub-catchments. The longitudinal profiles of the creeks
illustrate the slope gradients of the waterways. A hypsometric curve for
each sub-catchment provides an overall view of the slope of a catchment
and is closely related to ground slope characteristics of a catchment.
Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), also referred to as
airborne laser scanning (ALS), is one of the most effective means of
terrain data collection. Using LiDAR data for generation of DEMs is
becoming a standard practice in the spatial science community. This
study used airborne LiDAR data to generate a high-resolution DEM for
characteristic analysis of Gowrie Creek catchment in Toowoomba,
Queensland, Australia, which was affected by a flash flood in January
2011. Drainage networks and sub-catchment boundaries were extracted from
LiDAR-derived DEM. Catchment characteristics including sub-catchment
areas and shape indices, longitudinal profiles of creeks and hypsometric
curves of sub-catchments were calculated and analysed.

AB  - The increase of flood inundations occurring in different regions all
over the world has enhanced the need for effective flood risk
management. A flood can be determined as a mass of water that produces
runoff on land that is not normally covered by water. This study strives
to highlight the need of digital mapping of urban sprawl in a catchment
area in Cyprus and the assessment of its contribution to flood risk. The
Yialias River (Nicosia, Cyprus) was selected as case study where
devastating flash floods events took place at 2003 and 2009. In order to
search the diachronic land cover regime of the study area multi-temporal
satellite imagery was processed and analyzed, (ASTER). A classification
model is proposed based on spectral, texture and shape features in order
to create efficient land use and land cover maps. GIS were used to
detect identifying trends, both visually and statistically, resulting
from land use changes in a flood prone area such as Yialias by the use
of spatial metrics. The results indicated that there is a considerable
increase of urban areas cover during the last 10 years. All these
denoted that one the main driving force of the increasing flood risk in
catchment areas in Cyprus is generally associated to human activities.

AB  - A prototype of a road submersion warning system, providing a rating of
road submersion risks every 15 minutes during a storm event, at about
2000 points where roads and rivers intersect, has been developed for the
Gard region (French Mediterranean area). The computed risks result from
the confrontation between discharges produced by a distributed rainfall
runoff model and the estimated susceptibility to flooding of the
intersection points. The warning system is validated against road
inundations reported by the local road management service. The
comparison of the performances of this framework fed with various
quantitative precipitation estimates (1-km(2) grid interpolation of
point rainfall measurements or radar products) is presented herein. This
case study, based on highly distributed rainfall runoff modelling and on
a rich set of indirect observations of the flood magnitudes, provides a
priori an ideal framework to evaluate the usefulness of weather radar
products for hydrological applications.

AB  - In a continuation of Part I on spatial integration, this paper presents
research on the applicability of four satellite-based rainfall
algorithms to derive hourly rain intensities in the mid-latitudes using
highly resolved data from the first Meteosat Second Generation (MSG-1)
satellite. It focuses on the suitability of these algorithms to detect
and monitor (flash) flood-related rain intensities for different
temporal resolutions. The temporal integration is examined using six
different integration steps ranging from 1?h to 24?h and three different
data-filtering methods. The effects of this temporal integration on the
quality of satellite-based rain intensities (amounts and locations) are
examined with regard to heavy and possible flood-triggering rain
intensities. Also, loss of temporal information and possible
applications for flood risk management are considered. For this purpose,
Saxony (Germany) is used as an example, and 9 high-rainfall days between
May and August 2006 were analysed by comparing satellite rain
intensities to rain gauge-adjusted radar data. The results show that
temporal integration leads to improvements in evaluation scores,
especially for heavy rain intensities, by up to +62%. However, this
integration leads to a decreased applicability for the detection of
high-intensity rainfall events because they tend to be short in
duration.

AB  - This paper describes the ensemble approach to account for the
uncertainty in both rainfall and hydrological short-term prediction. The
range of probabilistic products generated by ensemble prediction and
their potential for obtaining flood risk estimates is demonstrated. An
ensemble rainfall prediction is developed by perturbing the initial
condition of the radar echo extrapolation model. The ensemble members
are subsequently considered as uncertain input of the distributed
hydrological model. Uncertainty in rainfall runoff model parameters is
assessed by the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE)
method. The methodology is demonstrated through case studies in the Kofu
urban river basin, Japan. The results reveal that plausible results can
be achieved, thus indicating that this approach could serve as a
reliable method for estimating the uncertainty range in short-term
prediction of runoff dynamics. When utilized along with the flood damage
model, we highlight the value of ensemble prediction for deriving flood
risk information through risk mapping.

AB  - Philippines experience frequent flash flooding, usually with
insufficient lead time which causes panic and fear to the people. In
spite of decades of effort by the government and the private sectors to
improve observations and warning, flash floods continue to be one of
nature's worst killers. On the average, there is at least one disastrous
flood every four (4) years in the Philippines {[}1]. This paper proposed
to develop a technology on Flash Flood Warning System Using SMS with
advanced warning information based on prediction algorithm devised by
the researcher regarding increasing water level and water speed. These
two factors were considered as triggers to the flashflood, thus become
components of the regression algorithm devised by the researchers. Based
on the training data captured for seven days, the regression equation
was developed while the actual/real time data were input to the
regression model. Prediction of the current and forthcoming risk on
flood is computed by the system based on the model and is sent through
SMS to registered users for early warning purposes.

AB  - The mega debris flow occurred on August 13(th) 2010 in Qingping town,
China (hereafter called `8.13' Debris Flow) have done great damage to
the local habitants as well as to the re-construction projects in the
quake-hit areas, and the channel-fill deposit problem caused by the
debris flow was the most destructive. Moreover, it is of high
possibility that an even severe deposit problem would reappear and
result in worse consequences. In order to maximize risk reduction of
this problem, relevant departments of the government established a
series of emergency river restoration schemes, for which the numerical
analysis is an important procedure to evaluate and determine the
optimized one. This study presents a numerical analysis by applying a
two-dimensional debris flow model combined with a relevant
water-sediment model to simulate the deposit during the progress of the
debris flow, and to calculate and analyze the river flow field under
both the present condition and different restoration conditions. The
results show that the debris flow model, which takes the confluence of
the Wenjia Gully to the main river into account, could simulate the
deposit process quite well. In the reproduced debris flow from the
simulation of the `8.13' Debris Flow, the original river flow path has
switched to a relatively lower place just along the right bank with a
high speed of near 7 m center dot s(-1) after being blocked by the
deposit, which is highly hazardous. To prevent this hazard, a
recommended scheme is derived through inter-comparison of different
restoration conditions. It shows that the recommended scheme is able to
reduce the water level and as well to regulate the flow path. Based on
the given conditions of the mainstream and the tributary confluence for
the simulated `8.13' Debris Flow, when encountering a debris flow with
deposit volume less than 0.5 million m(3), the river channel can endure
a 20-year return flood; however, when the deposit volume increases to 2
million m(3), the flood capacity of the river will be greatly impacted
and the scheme becomes invalid. The recommended scheme supported by the
present study has been applied to the emergency river restoration after
this mega-debris flow.

AB  - According to the International Disaster Database (CRED 2009) frequency
of extreme hydrological situations on a global scale is constantly
increasing. The most typical example of a natural risk in Europe is
flood there is a decrease in the number of victims, but a significant
increase in economic damage. A decrease in the number of victims is
caused by the application of current hydrological management that
focuses its attention primarily on large rivers and elimination of the
damages caused by major flood situations. The growing economic losses,
however, are a manifestation of the increasing intensity of floods on
small watercourses, which are usually not sufficiently taken into
account by the management approaches. The research of small streams
should focus both on the study of the watercourse itself, especially its
ecomorphological properties, and in particular on the possibility of
flood control measures and their effectiveness. An important part of
society's access to sustainable development is also the evolution of
knowledge about the river landscape area, which is perceived as a
significant component of global environmental security and resilience,
thanks to its high compensatory potential for mitigation of
environmental change. The findings discussed under this contribution are
based on data obtained during implementation of the project
``GeoRISK{''} (Geo-analysis of landscape level degradation and natural
risks formation), which takes into account the above approaches applied
in different case studies catchments of small streams in different parts
of the Czech Republic. Our findings offer an opportunity for practical
application of field research knowledge in decision making processes
within the national level of current water management.

AB  - In Italy, growing urbanization is leading to a higher risk of flooding
of small water courses, especially in steep catchments of limited area,
where severe flash flood events can occur. The assessment of flash flood
hazard requires new modelling tools that can reproduce both the rainfall
runoff processes in the catchment, and the flow processes in the
drainage network. In this paper we propose the use of a simple
two-dimensional hydraulic model for analysing a flood scenario in a
small valley within the urban area of the city of Bologna, Italy.
Historically this area has been prone to severe flood events, the most
recent of which occurred in 1955 and 1932. Since then there has been a
significant increase in urbanization of the lower portion of the
catchment, while the natural stream bed has been partially replaced by a
culvert. The two-dimensional hydraulic model was therefore applied at
catchment scale, in order to simulate the possible effects of historical
scenarios in the present catchment configuration. Rainfall and runoff
data measured during recent rainfall events were used to calibrate model
parameters. Model results show that the current culvert section would be
insufficient to drain the runoff produced by intense rainfall events,
with potential inundation of surrounding urban areas.

AB  - Extreme rainfall on Mediterranean karstic watersheds can lead to flash
floods that may cause serious human and material losses. The
anticipation of these events and the risk management during flood events
are at the core of society and financial stakes. Karstic aquifers should
also be considered as valuable groundwater resources. An active
management of these aquifers may allow for an optimal use of water
resources, while regulating the influence of the karst during flood risk
periods. This study was carried out in the framework of the
``Multiple-Use Management of the Mediterranean Karstic Aquifer of the
Lez River{''} project. It aimed at identifying the impact of the
anthropic management of the water resource and floods under the present
and future climate on the catchment. This project led to building a
graphical method (toolbox for flood management presented as an abacus)
for (i) a better understanding of the evolution of the water volume of
the karstic system, the river discharge and the propagation of floods
through constructed infrastructure of the river in urban areas, (ii)
real-time flood forecasting, and (iii) analysing the impact of climate
projections and active management scenarios with respect to the water in
the karstic system as well as with respect to the flooding areas. The
use of active management is thus shown to increase the availability of
water resources while reducing flood risks.

AB  - City of Gdansk is located in a coastal region where changing climatic
conditions increase the frequency of extreme weather events. Developing
urbanization affects the hydrology of natural basins by simplification
of the drainage system and reduction of infiltration and base flow.
Consequently greater runoff rates flow into storm water collection
systems, reservoirs and surrounding water bodies. Not only
infrastructures of urban areas but also citizens are exposed to the
effects of heavier rainfalls or sudden snowmelts, resulting in flash
floods, damages of hydro-technical systems, as well as environmental
risks. Development of integrated solutions including precipitation,
stream flow and reservoirs storage monitoring and management can reduce
flood risk and help to protect the public health. In years 2011-2013
Department of Hydraulic Engineering (Faculty of Civil and Environmental
Engineering of Gdansk University of Technology) in collaboration with
The Provincial Fund For Environmental Protection and Water Management in
Gdansk and Gdanskie Melioracje Sp. z o.o undertook the implementation of
storm water monitoring system in the Strzyza River basin in Gdansk. The
results of measurements allowed performing the HEC-HMS hydrological
model for one of the most flood prone areas of Gdansk. Research on the
development of the technical and non-technical methods of flood control,
numerical modeling for build-up area inundation prediction, expansion of
the existing rainfall-runoff and storage monitoring system, integrated
water quantity and quality analysis are continued in frame of ongoing

criteria decision-making methods to identify the small stream basins
with high risk of flooding and to determine the optimal small stream
restoration measures by priority ranking for flood risk. The 12
representative factors for the flood risk assessment were carefully
selected and constructed for the three main aspects, such as pressure
factors, state factors and response factors including the government
capacities under the pressure-state-response classification system for
identifying the 212 small stream watersheds. The entropy weight
coefficient method helps to reduce subjective judgments as well as
calculate effective weighting coefficients. To evaluate the practical
applications of the proposed method, the results from the preference
ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) with
six preference functions are compared with the official priority ranking
of flood risk assessment for the Small Stream Watershed Restoration
Projects which is determined by the weighted method. Also, guidelines
for the community-based restoration projects such as prevention or
preparedness, sustainable development and resilient recovering have been
suggested based on the three predicted priority ranking groups. It is
expected that the flood risk assessment ranking ensured by full
verification can help to establish optimal regional restoration plans
against flooding disasters with respect to causes and characteristics of
past flash flood.

AB  - The presence of large wood (logs, trees, branches and roots) in rivers
may aggravate the consequences of flood events. This material may affect
infrastructures such as bridges, weirs, etc., especially those
intersecting forested mountain rivers. Until recently, a widely accepted
practice (in Spain) was to systematically remove wood from river
channels as a preventive measure. However, it is well known now that
this practice may be useless as the material is transported and
deposited after each flood. In addition, this practice might be not
beneficial for the natural balance of the river ecosystem in a long term
perspective. Therefore, the presence of this woody material in rivers
must be managed and included in flood hazard and risk analysis. However,
there is lack of studies in this respect in Spain, and therefore there
is a lack of related bibliography in Spanish. In this paper we present a
detailed review of recent methods proposed to analyse large wood in
rivers, and in addition we propose a comprehensive methodological
approach to study the role of large wood in rivers, with a focus on
flood hazard. First, to understand the dynamics of wood recruitment, the
contributing areas delivering wood to the streams have to be delineated
and the recruitment processes studied. Thus, an estimate of the
potential volume of deliverable wood can be obtained. To analyse wood
transport we present a numerical model, which allows simulating the
behaviour of individual pieces of wood together with hydrodynamics.
These methods have been tested in several rivers in Gredos Mountain
Range (Avila, Spain), and we present here a synthesis of the main
obtained results. As a final conclusion of these results we can affirm
that a good river management requires a proper management of the
riparian vegetation and in-stream large wood, and this management should
find the equilibrium between the good ecological conditions and the
potential risks.

AB  - At present times, an intensification of the hydrological risk can be
observed, and during the last 10 years, several flash floods with a
probability greater than 1% have occurred on numerous, small-sized
drainage basins in Romania. The Ozana drainage basin is reduced in
dimensions, but has a very large hydrologic potential. On the river
valley, there are a total of 11 villages, out of which 9 have a
pronounced risk to flooding, acording to the data given by the Flood
Directive 2007/60/CE. The purpose of this paper is to identify the time
intervals characterized by positive or negative pluviometric anomalies,
and the frequency that they have. There are two main categories of
hydrological risks, associated with the drainage basin: first of all,
there are the floodrelated risks, mostly caused by extreme precipitation
events; and second of all, the periods characterized by drought, during
times with water deficit. The latter has been observed to occur
downstream of Dumbrava village (at 11 km from the confluence with
Moldova river), and its negative effects involve the degrading of local
ichthyofauna, groundwater depletion, and the reduction in quantity of
the water sources. In order to identify the periods with anomalies,
compared to the average precipitation values, and also to their
frequency, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) has been
calculated. SPI was calculated for a period of 36 years (1977 - 2013),
at different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 12 months). The analysis has
revealed anomalies varying from -3 to + 3, representing time spans with
both excess and deficit in pluviometric recordings. In order to identify
the variability periods, as well as the couple of years, which can be
characterised through the same type of anomalies, the Fourier analysis
has been applied. By calculating the Fourier Transform, predictions can
be made on the return time of a certain type of climatic influence.

AB  - Extreme climate phenomena are occurring around the world caused by
global climate change, and Korea is no exception. Heavy rains continue
to occur in Korea, which exceed the previous highest rainfall records.
In particular, as flash floods generate heavy rainfall on the mountains
over a relatively a short period of time, the likelihood of landslides
increases. Therefore, it is necessary to scientifically analyze
landslide risk areas to minimize damage in the event of a landslide, and
to collect and analyze a variety of spatial information. This study
constructs a spatial information database using GIS and integrating
geography, hydrology, geology, and forestry, which is required for a
complete analysis of landslide risk areas. We also carried out a case
study of Injegun, Gangwondo, which suffered from serious landslides and
flash floods in 2006 after Typhoon Ewiniar, by overlaying site
monitoring data with airborne images.
Furthermore, this study evaluates slope stability of the affected areas
using SINMAP (Stability Index Mapping), analyzes spatial data that have
high correlation with selected landslide areas using Likelihood Ratio,
and prepares landslide prediction of the mountainous areas that are
vulnerable to disasters.

AB  - In recent years, flash flood disasters have occurred frequently in
southwest China due to the increased frequency of extreme climate
events. To solve this problem, great efforts have been made in studying
the process of flash flood. However, little attention was paid on
bearing body of hazard, the clusters of buildings. Thus the real
disaster mechanism of flash flood remains unclear. Accordingly, based on
the experiments of artificial flash floods in a conceptual solid model,
this paper focuses on the flood-impacted inundation characteristics of
the building clusters at different locations of the gully model, in
order to obtain a better understanding of the disaster process and the
interaction between the flash floods and building clusters. The results
showed that, in a typical smallscale flash flood gully with hot and dry
climate, 1) clusters of buildings on an alluvial fan could reduce about
35% of the flooding area by blocking the diffusion of the flood to the
depression areas, and could also promote the deposition in lower reaches
of the river channel by blocking the overbank flow from going back into
the channel, making the width-depth ratio of the channel larger. 2) The
flash flood rates of disaster and hazard on the alluvial fan are
generally higher than that of the inner gully. For the inner gully,
buildings located on the beaches along the lower river and the
transitional areas of the straight channel and channel bends can easily
be affected because of their lower elevations. For the alluvial fan,
buildings nearby the meanders suffer the greatest impacts because of
bank collapsing and flooding. 3) The safe vertical distance from a
building to the river channel is 13 m for the buildings in the inner
gully under extreme floods. Below this threshold, the smaller the
vertical distance is, the greater the risk exposure is. For the
buildings on the alluvial fan, especially for the buildings near the
concave bank of the top rush point, the horizontal distance is more
important, and the safe value is 80 m under extreme floods.

PD  - 
AB  - Karachi is a strategic city of Pakistan since it serves as the gateway
for international trade through the. This city has faced rapid
population increase and industrial growth which are now causing
environmental issues, social problems and economic stresses and
challenges. Urban development and industrialization have extensively
changed the landuse/landcover (LULC) and drainage pattern of the city.
Majority of the old streams have been blocked that caused localized
flash flooding in the city after heavy rainfall events. The natural
drainage network of Karachi consists of two (2) major river systems -
Malir River on the eastern side of the city and Lyari River which passes
through the center of the city draining majority of its storm water.
These rivers and their tributaries have been affected very badly due to
the urbanization and bad urban management. This paper discusses the
changes in LULCs over the past 16 years selecting Malir basin as a case
study. Hydraulic flood modeling of Malir River is also presented here
for 50 and 100 years floods. SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission)
Digital Elevation Model (1 Arc Second) and topographic sheets of 1975
and 2001 (1: 50000) are used to demarcate natural drainage or Karachi
District on digital maps and to delineate stream network using
Geographical Information System (GIS) software tool Arc Hydro.
Historical rainfall data are used to simulate runoff using hydrologic
models HEC-HMS and GeoHMS. The flood extent is modeled using hydraulic
models HEC-RAS and GeoRAS. GIS overlay analysis combines LULCs and river
drainage layers to identify the blocked area and to quantify the
specific LULCs that caused the river blockades. Maps of blockages and
flood extent can be used for revival of natural drainage network and
flood mitigation and preparedness. The beneficiaries of this study may
include local disaster risk management, planning and development
authorities.

AB  - The dreadful floods of 1999, 2002 and 2003 in South of France have
alerted public opinion on the need for a more efficient and a further
generalized national flood-forecasting system. This is why in 2003
Irstea and Meteo-France have implemented a new warning method for flash
floods, including on small watersheds, using radar rainfall data in
real-time: the AIGA method. This modelling method currently provides
real-time information on the magnitude of floods, but doesn't take into
account the elements at risk surrounding the river streams. Its benefit
for crisis management is therefore limited as it doesn't give
information on the actual flood risk. To improve the relevance of the
AIGA method, this paper shows the benefits of the combination of
hydrological warnings with an exposure index, to be able to assess the
risk of flood-related damage in real time. To complete this aim, this
work presents an innovative and easily reproducible method to evaluate
exposure to floods over large areas with simple land-use data. For
validation purpose, a damage database has been implemented to test the
relevance of both AIGA warnings and exposure levels. A case study on the
floods of the 3rd October 2015 is presented to test the effectiveness of
the combination of hazard and exposure to assess the risk of
flood-related damage. This combination seems to give an accurate
overview of the streams at risk, where the most important amount of
damage has been observed after the flood.

AB  - A web-based Decision Support System, named FLIRE DSS, for combined
forest fire control and planning as well as flood risk management, has
been developed and is presented in this paper. State of the art tools
and models have been used in order to enable Civil Protection agencies
and local stakeholders to take advantage of the web based DSS without
the need of local installation of complex software and their
maintenance. Civil protection agencies can predict the behavior of a
fire event using real time data and in such a way plan its efficient
elimination. Also, during dry periods, agencies can implement
``what-if{''} scenarios for areas that are prone to fire and thus have
available plans for forest fire management in case such scenarios occur.
Flood services include flood maps and flood-related warnings and become
available to relevant authorities for visualization and further analysis
on a daily basis. When flood warnings are issued, relevant authorities
may proceed to efficient evacuation planning for the areas that are
likely to flood and thus save human lives. Real-time weather data from
ground stations provide the necessary inputs for the calculation of the
fire model in real-time, and a high resolution weather forecast grid
supports flood modeling as well as the development of ``what-if{''}
scenarios for the fire modeling. All these can be accessed by various
computer sources including PC, laptop, Smartphone and tablet either by
normal network connection or by using 3G and 4G cellular network. The
latter is important for the accessibility of the FLIRE DSS during
firefighting or rescue operations during flood events. All these methods
and tools provide the end users with the necessary information to design
an operational plan for the elimination of the fire events and the
efficient management of the flood events in almost real time.
Concluding, the FLIRE DSS can be easily transferred to other areas with
similar characteristics due to its robust architecture and its
flexibility.

PD  - 
AB  - Flash floods cause damages and need emergency actions especially in
urban areas. Flood forecasting and flood warning systems (FFFWSs) can be
used for reducing flood damages and saving lives in areas vulnerable to
flooding. However, researches are needed to evaluate the effect of
urbanisation and the significance of implementing catchment-management
plan (ICMP) on FFFWS. This paper describes a framework proposed to
assess the impact of ICMP on expected lead time (ELT) of flash-flood
warning and it was applied for an urbanised steep catchment in an arid
region, north of metropolitan city, Tehran, Iran. The model is well
calibrated and validated before and after ICMP by four observed floods.
The results show that ICMP reduces mainly flood risk only in low-return
periods (about 30%) than in high-return periods. Finally, this paper
demonstrated the efficiency of ICMP in increasing emergency time for
evacuation from possible inundated areas except in extreme floods
events.

AB  - Mountains and their foothills are areas where intense floods are
characterized by high discharge and where they occur more often than in
lowlands. Furthermore, due to the fact that they are mainly caused by
short-lasting heavy rainfall events, they are difficult to predict. The
dense network of meteorological stations and river gauges is crucial to
understand hydrological processes and to forecast floods. Most mountain
regions suffer from a scarcity of instrumental data that are long enough
for scientific purposes. In such cases where historical data or
instrumental records are lacking, floods in forested catchments can be
analysed by using growth series from trees growing along stream
channels. In the streams draining the northern slopes of the Tatra
Mountains, it was possible to reconstruct the occurrence and magnitude
of paleofloods using tree-ring data. More than 1100 increment cores were
sampled from 218 Picea abies and Abies alba trees growing at 6 stream
sectors and allowed determination of 480 growth disturbances and a
definition of the magnitude of 47 flood events between A.D. 1866 and
2012. In this region, floods are triggered by intense and prolonged
rainfall events in spring and summer. These paleoflood records also
allowed construction of a regional flood analysis and to reduce the
uncertainties in the flood frequency assessment.

PD  - 
AB  - Steep headwater catchments in areas that experience intense rainfall can
generate rapid floods. The significant risk to life and property posed
by rapid floods means that they are a subject of great interest to flood
forecasting. However, the rapid rise and short duration of flood
hydrographs presents a difficulty for standard precipitation-runoff
models, which generally operate on a daily time-step. The Hydrologiska
Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model is a conceptual distributed
hydrological model, normally applied to simulation of snow-melt
hydrographs that can operate with an hourly time-step. In this paper, we
modified the HBV model by adding a hillslope overland flow component so
that the model would have more physical meaning when applied to
prediction of floods humid climate zones. Hourly models for small-,
medium-, and large-sized floods were calibrated and validated for flood
events from the Tangjing catchment, a medium and small catchment within
a humid subtropical climate zone of China. The calibration period
utilized 50 events from the period 1980-1999, and the validation period
utilized 20 flood events from the period 2000-2004. The model
performance was evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index and
indicators of compliance of the modeled result with the observed result
in terms of flood peak magnitude, flood runoff volume, and duration of
flood peak. These indicators demonstrated good agreement between the
observed and simulated hydrographs for the calibration and validation
periods, achieving a reliability that was adequate for the purpose of
flood forecasting in accordance with the relevant Chinese standard. We
also applied the HBV model in its original configuration to the flood
events, but its performance was generally inferior to that of the
modified model. The modified model outperformed the original model
mainly with respect to simulation of flood peak magnitude and flood peak
timing.

AB  - The number and intensity of water-related disasters are increasing
tremendously. Floods and inundations in the Mediterranean countries are
often caused by torrential rains. In Algeria, floods have left more than
1000 dead and caused loss of around 550 million euros. In Mekerra Basin,
northwestern Algeria, the flooding risk is growing. This paper diagnoses
the causes and the flood damage that generates Wadi Mekerra. Besides,
the legislative texts are also discussed. Predicting the flooding risk
is done through numerical modeling of two typical flood waves. It is a
comparison between two numerical models, Van Leer finite volume scheme
and Petrov Galarkin finite element scheme with recorded hydrographs.
Based on these results, several additional actions are recommended at
the end of this work.

AB  - The southern coast of the Caspian Sea in northern Iran is bordered by a
mountain range with forested catchments which are susceptible to
droughts and floods. This paper examines possible changes to runoff
patterns from one of these catchments in response to climate change
scenarios. The HEC-HMS rainfall-runoff model was used with downscaled
future rainfall and temperature data from 13 global circulation models,
and meteorological and hydrometrical data from the Casilian (or
Kassilian) Catchment. Annual and seasonal predictions of runoff change
for three future emissions scenarios were obtained, which suggest
significantly higher spring rainfall with increased risk of flooding and
significantly lower summer rainfall leading to a higher probability of
drought. Flash floods arising from extreme rainfall may become more
frequent, occurring at any time of year. These findings indicate a need
for strategic planning of water resource management and mitigation
measures for increasing flood hazards.

in regulatory efforts toward preparation for extreme weather events
including flash floods. In this article, we use
difference-in-differences models of the number of car accidents from
days with government issued alerts for flash flood events in Virginia.
We find that wireless alert messages for flash flood warnings reduced
car accidents by 15.9% relative to the counterfactual with non-wireless
alert protocols. We also use a regression discontinuity model to analyze
hourly traffic volume data immediately before and after a flash flood
warning message is issued. We find that traffic volume is reduced by
3.1% immediately following the issuance of a wireless alert relative to
before the alert. These results imply that wireless alert messages
effectively reduce exposure to hazards associated with extreme weather.

AB  - PREVIEW is an European Commission FP6 Integrated Project which aims at
developing, on an European level, new geo-information services for
natural and industrial risk management. The work package WP4340 focuses
on forecast of Mediterranean flash floods. Phase 1 was devoted to the
assessment of the usefulness of kilometric scale atmospheric model
forecast for hydrological applications and to the development of
hydro-meteorological coupled systems based on high-resolution
atmospheric models and hydrological models able to reproduce the
hydrological behaviour of Mediterranean catchments. Four high-resolution
models at 2-3 km resolution have been run on five flash-flood cases over
the French C,vennes-Vivarais and Italian Piedmont regions; models are
MM5 (by NOA), COSMO-2 (by MeteoSwiss), MESO-NH (by M,t,o-France) and
COSMO-LAMI (by Arpa Piemonte). To investigate the benefit of coupling
atmospheric and hydrological models, the quantitative precipitation
forecasts (QPF) have been verified against observations using both
classical and categorical statistical scores, while the sensitivity of
the QPF to the model initial conditions has been also examined. In
addition, the various hourly precipitation forecasts were supplied as
input to hydrological models to evaluate through the simulated
discharges the value of high resolution forecasts for hydrological
forecast purposes. Clearly the hydrological verification conclusions
differ from the QPF verification ones and show the usefulness of
developing such hydrological verification as the one performed here.

PD  - 
AB  - The potential of Local Sensitivity Analysis (LSA) for analysis of
uncertainty with respect to two major risks in river hydrodynamics -
flash flood and dam failure - is assessed. LSA, implemented as an
equation-based method, is compared to a Global Uncertainty Analysis
(GUA) consisting in running Monte Carlo simulations with a hydrodynamic
model. For a given statistical distribution of the model input
parameters, the mean and standard deviation of the output variables are
estimated with the two methods. In all single or multiple parameter
cases investigated, including as much as +/- 80% relative variation,
LSA provides similar results to GUA, while requiring only one simulation
instead of several hundreds or thousands. Only within a few meters of
the shock (flow discontinuity) generated by the breaking of a dam do the
two methods depart. This paper shows that despite the non-linearity of
river flow processes, the first order, local approach remains generally
valid for uncertainty analysis of hydrodynamic risks, even in the case
of large parameter uncertainty. The contrast in importance of the
various parameters on both sides of a shock is also highlighted. (C)

AB  - According to the number of torrential watercourses, the frequency of
occurrence and the consequences that have resulted in the past,
torrential floods are the most frequent and disastrous natural hazards
in Serbia. Since they are always followed by severe material damages and
often casualties, the character of torrential flood events seems to be a
real challenge in natural risk management in our country. In this paper,
phenomenon of torrential floods in Kolubara river basin is presented
through temporal and spatial characterization of registered torrential
flood events. The dataset of 121 recorded torrential flood events in the
Kolubara river basin for the period from 1929 to 2010 is derived from
the Inventory of torrential floods in Serbia for the period of 99 years,
1915-2013 (with 848 torrential flood events and over 133 casualties).
The main focus is on the frequency of occurrence of registered
torrential flood events. Within a year, there is a primary peak in May
and June and secondary peak in March; this finding corresponds greatly
to the monthly distribution of all registered events on the Inventory
level. Frequency of torrential floods occurrence within a researched
period shows a significant increment, the number of registered events is
more than doubled comparing the latest period (1991-2010) with the first
one (1929-1960), while the in-between period (1961-1990) already
indicates that increase. These results can be used for improving the
system of preventive and mitigation measures in order to reduce the
torrential flood consequences to an acceptable level.

AB  - A study was undertaken to review international literature pertaining to
people's behavior in and around floodwater. The review focused on
people's voluntary entry of floodwater. From the literature, five
predominant reasons for entering floodwater were identified, including
undertaking a recreational activity; attempting to reach a destination;
retrieving property, livestock, or pets; undertaking employment duties;
and rescuing or assisting with evacuation. Two primary influences on
entering floodwater were found, namely risk perception (i.e., being
unaware of or underestimating the risk from flooding) and social
influences (i.e., being influenced by others). Demographics and
environmental and temporal factors also played a part in decision-making
about whether to enter floodwater or not. Emergency managers should take
account of such factors when devising future public education
strategies. Further research, including comparisons with current
theoretical models, could help identify additional influences on
decision-making for floodwater entry.

PD  - 
AB  - An improved understanding, modeling and forecasting of
hydrometeorological extremes over the flood-prone Western Mediterranean
region is one of the milestones of the international HyMeX program. A
set of severe hydrometeorological episodes affected various basins
across south and eastern Mediterranean Spain from 27 to 29 September
2012. Flooding was particularly catastrophic in Andalusia and Murcia,
where 10 fatalities occurred and material losses were estimated at 120
ME. The predictability bounds set by the type and scales of the
processes involved in such high-impact episodes require the explicit
representation of uncertainty in the hydrometeorological forecasting
chain. A short-range ensemble prediction system (EPS) provides the
optimal framework to generate risk-based forecasts supporting valuable
early warning procedures and mitigation measures. We explore the
potential of this probabilistic forecasting approach on the 28 September
2012 flash flood in the Guadalentin river basin, a medium-sized
catchment located in Murcia, southeastern Spain. After a rigorous
calibration with rain-gauge data, the hydrological response of the basin
to this flooding is accurately simulated by the Hydrologic Engineering
Center's Hydrological Modeling System runoff model. Then, we explore the
uncertainty transference from a collection of mesoscale meteorological
deterministic and probabilistic 48 h predictions provided by the Weather
Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The meteorological simulations are
nested within the global EPS of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts, therefore inheriting the spread of the global system
and providing probabilistic high-resolution precipitation structures to
the hydrological model. By assuming the calibrated model as a good
representation of a perfect hydrological model for this event, it
becomes an advanced and user-oriented verification tool for quantitative
precipitation forecasts. Results highlight the benefits of accounting
for uncertainties in the precipitation forecasts and the value of the
proposed set-up for the short-range prediction of quantitative discharge
forecasts. The warn-on-forecast approach is shown to be possible within
a probabilistic hydrometeorological forecasting chain for basins as
small and fast-responsive as the Guadalentin basin, proving to be
suitable for civil protection warning procedures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the delimitation of flood-prone areas, particularly in areas that are
difficult to access using traditional flight equipment, the most
critical problem is the generation of a high-quality DEM of the major
and minor riverbed, in order to obtain several hydraulic parameters
(e.g., the surface of the drainage section, average water velocity) with
equivalent accuracy. The chosen area for the case study represents one
with the greatest history of hydrological risk factors in the SomeAYul
Mic basin, given the extreme previous hydrological events that have
taken place (e.g., in the year 1995) as well as the limited capacity of
the river for upstream river flow, and to handle the volume of the flash
floods. In this study, the use of UAV technology coupled with Leica
MultiStation for validation made it possible to achieve this
performance. Another advantage was the existence of the hydrometric
station situated in the middle of the study area, the information from
which was used for statistics, calibration of the measurements and
validation of the results obtained (roughness of the riverbed, the debit
with an overflow possibility). The hydraulic calculations performed on
the 11 transverse profiles, conducted using the GIS terrain model, led
to the high accuracy defining of the flood-prone areas corresponding to
the flows in the major riverbed with probabilities of 1 and 5 %. Also
highlighted on the 2D and 3D images were several civilian areas at risk
in the case of extreme hydrological events, related to maximum flow.

AB  - Glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and related debris flows are among
the most significant natural threats in the Tien Shan Mountains of
Kyrgyzstan and have even caused the loss of life and damage to
infrastructure in its capital Bishkek. An improved understanding of the
occurrence of this process is essential so as to be able to design
reliable disaster risk reduction strategies, even more so in view of
ongoing climate change and scenarios of future evolutions. Here, we
apply a dendrogeomorphic approach to reconstruct past debris-flow
activity on the Aksay cone (Ala-Archa valley, Kyrgyz range), where
outbursting glacier lakes and intense rainfalls have triggered huge
debris flows over the past decades.
A total of 96 Picea abies (L.) Karst. trees growing on the cone and
along the main channel have been selected based on the evidence of past
debris-flow damage in their trunks; these trees were then sampled using
increment borers. The dating of past events was based on the assessment
of growth disturbances (GD) in the tree-ring records and included the
detection of injuries, tangential rows of traumatic resin ducts,
reaction wood, and abrupt growth changes. In total, 320 GD were
identified in the tree-ring samples. In combination with aerial imagery
and geomorphic recognition in the field, reactions in trees and their
position on the cone have allowed reconstruction of the main spatial
patterns of past events on the Aksay cone.
Our findings suggest that at least 27 debris flows have occurred on the
site between 1877 and 2015 and point to the occurrence of at least 17
events that were not documented prior to this study. We also observe
high process activity during the 1950s and 1960s, with major events on
the cone in 1950, 1966, and 1968, coinciding with phases of slight
glacier advance. The spatial analyses of events also point to two
different spatial patterns, suggesting that quite dissimilar magnitudes
probably occurred during glacier lake outburst floods and rainfall
induced debris-flow events. The results presented here represent the
longest, annually resolved GLOF series in the region, which in turn has
key implications on risk assessment, not just in the Ala-Archa valley,
but also in the entire Kyrgyz range (northern Tien Shan). (C) 2016

AB  - Floods represent a common process in Tatra Mountain streams and may
cause flood risk in the valleys of the Tatra foreland. Dealing with the
hazards and risks caused by floods requires a detailed analysis of the
frequency and magnitude of past and recent events. However, the Polish
Tatra region is characterized by a-scarcity of data on past floods in
general and on systematic peak discharge in particular. In this study,
we performed a paleohydrological analyses in four high-gradient mountain
streams using scarred trees as paleostage indicators. We couple
two-dimensional hydraulic modelling in a highly-resolved topographic
environment (LiDAR data) with an important spatiotemporal data set of
scars on trees to investigate (i) the magnitude of unrecorded major
floods of the twentieth century, (ii) the effect of variability in
geomorphic tree positions on the peak discharge reconstruction, and
(iii) the impact of reconstructed events on the results of flood
frequency analyses. The data set is based on a total of 55 scarred trees
and allows peak discharge reconstruction of 16 major floods covering the
last 113 years. Results suggest that trees growing in straight stream
reaches or in the inner side of channel bends would be better candidates
for peak discharge reconstructions than trees located on the outer side
of channel bends or growing in overbank sections with dense vegetation
cover. The largest reconstructed flood is dated to 1903 with an
estimated peak discharge of 115.9 +/- 59.2 m(3) s(-1), and
larger-than-today floods are found to have occurred at Strazyska and
Lysa Polana in the first half of the twentieth century. The inclusion of
our results into the flood frequency analyses suggests that flood
hazards might have been underestimated by up to 25.5% in the case of a
100-year flood in Strazyski Stream. In that sense, our findings will be
useful for the design of future strategies dealing with flood risks in
the foreland of the Polish Tatra Mountains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Y1  - 2017///
PD  - 
AB  - New York City (NYC) is an ultra-urban region, with over 50% impervious
cover and buried stream channels. Traditional flood studies rely on the
presence of stream gages to detect flood stage and discharge, but these
methods cannot be used in ultra-urban areas. Here we create a
high-resolution radar rainfall dataset for NYC and utilize citizen and
expert reports of flooding throughout the city to study flash flooding
in NYC. Results indicate that interactions between the urban area and
land-sea boundary have an important impact on the spatial variability of
both heavy rainfall and flooding, sometimes in contrast to results
obtained for other cities. Top days of daily and hourly rainfall exhibit
a rainfall maximum over the city center and an extended region of higher
rainfall downwind of the city. The mechanism for flooding appears to
vary across the city, with high groundwater tables influencing more
coastal areas and high rain rates or large rain volumes influencing more
inland areas. There is also a strong relationship between sewer type and
flood frequency, with fewer floods observed in combined sewer areas.
Flooding is driven by maximum one-hour to one-day rainfall, which is
often substantially less rain than observed for the city-wide daily
maximum.

T1  - Flood risk management approaches and tools for mitigation strategies of coastal submersions and preparedness of crisis management in France
A1  - Cabal, Agnes

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - As a consequence of the disastrous Xynthia storm surge on 27-28 February
2010, France has significantly modified the country's regulations
related to flood risk management through implementation of the national
plan for mitigation and management of the flash submersions (Plan
Submersions Rapides). The paper describes the results of `CRISMA -
Modelling crisis management for improved action and preparedness', a
collaborative research and development project co-funded by the European
Community (2011-2014), which developed a generic framework for
implementation of simulation-based decision support systems in different
domains of the natural or industrial risks (floods, snowstorms,
earthquakes, forest fires, accidental pollutions, mass accidents). In
particular, the paper addresses the CRISMA-WAVE application of the
framework regarding simulation of submersion effects at a range of
temporal and spatial scales, preparedness planning and assessment of
impacts depending on scenarios based on mitigation options for managing
the inundation risks in the pilot area, Charente Maritime county. In
addition, an example of a complex regulatory study implementing a flood
prevention action programme along the Northern Sea coast in order to
provide an overall midand long-term intervention strategy regarding the
combined risk of river floods and marine submersion, making use of
CRISMA-WAVE methods and tools, is presented. The simulation capacity of
the platform appears to provide a very good analytic support to find
negotiated solutions corresponding to a consensus of all the
stakeholders. The prevention strategy developed for the area is based on
a solidarity principle between coastal areas and land areas. Adaptation
of the territory to the increased risks due to the climate change will
need tens of years to be effective.

AB  - Muscat Governorate in the Sultanate of Oman is located along the sea of
Oman and urban development has therefore had to occur in the intervening
flat coastal plains and valleys along the coastline. The physical
location of Muscat Governorate exposes the city to heavy rain and
cyclones as they hit the coastline from the Sea of Oman. This underlying
exposure plays a major role in the risk processes that lead to the
emphasis of particular climate change risks including storm surge and
rain-related flooding as experienced during Gonu Cyclone in 2007 and
Phet Cyclone in 2010. For assessing flooding risk analysis, this study
combined flooding hazard maps with major land use cover to quantify and
validate the risks of flash flooding to urban area and infrastructures.
Analysis identified substantial areas within the governorate exposure to
high, medium, and low risks from extreme rainfall events that could lead
to direct damages to roads, buildings, and other properties. This
reinforces the need to protect and strengthen current defenses against
these events as well as greater preparedness in disaster response.

AB  - The frequent extreme weather events have led to dramatic urban
waterlogging and flash flood hazards in recent years, which result in
heavy casualties and serious economic losses. Mountainous cities like
Fuzhou, China, usually experience both types of hazard concurrently and
are susceptible to these hazards. Therefore, it is necessary to take
comprehensive defense measures to prevent and/or mitigate the impacts of
these hazards. In this study, the authors first reviewed the progress of
prevention measures of these two types of hazards in China through the
nationwide construction of sponge cities and national flash flood
prevention projects. The authors then analyzed the characteristics of
waterlogging and flash flood hazards in China using 25years of records
from the Chinese government and elaborated the causes and existing
issues. Results show that flash floods and urban waterlogging in
mountainous cities have exacerbated the severity of flood hazards. Based
on the typical effective measures of such flood hazard prevention
systems, the authors also discussed the possible comprehensive
preventive measures to be implemented in Fuzhou via the spongy city
construction, which can provide a reference for future flood management.

PD  - 
AB  - To simulate flood processes at the basin level, the GPU-based
High-Performance Integrated Hydrodynamic Modelling System (HiPIMS) is
gaining interest as computational capability increases. However, the
difficulty of coping with rainfall input to HiPIMS reduces the
possibility of acquiring a satisfactory simulation accuracy. The
objective of this study is to test the sensitivity of the surface runoff
coefficient in the HiPIMS source term in the Misai basin with an area of
797 km(2) in south China. To achieve this, the basin was divided into
909,824 grid cells, to each of which a Manning coefficient was assigned
based on its land use type interpreted from remote sensing data. A
sensitivity analysis was conducted for three typical flood processes
under four types of surface runoff coefficients, assumed a priori, upon
three error functions. The results demonstrate the crucial role of the
surface runoff coefficient in achieving better simulation accuracy and
reveal that this coefficient varies with flood scale and is unevenly
distributed over the basin.

AB  - The identification and classification of critical coastal areas is
becoming more and more important from a coastal management point of
view, especially considering future climate change. The standardized
assessment of multiple hazards and their potential impacts is crucial,
in terms of risk management, for those coastal areas where both marine
and fluvial hazards can occur.
Nevertheless, in Bocca di Magra (Liguria Region, Italy), where both
coastal and fluvial flooding can occur, up until now the potential
impacts from marine flooding have not been thought to be of importance;
only the impact of fluvial flooding has been systematically analysed.
Now, however, the Liguria Regional stakeholders have become interested
in understanding the potential impact of marine inundations compared to
fluvial inundations, applying the CRAF (Coastal Risk Assessment
Framework) methodology developed inside the RISC-KIT project.
The hazard modelling of coastal and fluvial inundations was used,
together with exposure data, to evaluate the direct and systemic impacts
generated by both flooding mechanisms separately. An End-User-driven
Multi Criteria Analysis was implemented to compare coastal and fluvial
impacts on the same area.
For an event with a 1 in 200 year return period, the CRAF predicts that
fluvial inundation generates higher impacts, in comparison to the marine
one. Even though the impacts in the coastal area are less, the impacted
exposed elements are different from those impacted by fluvial inundation
and none of them can be excluded from the analysis.
This work highlights the need for regional managers to develop combined
coastal-fluvial flooding assessments; such actions should be seen as a
priority for flood disaster risk management in locations affected by
both marine flooding and riverine flash flooding.

PD  - 
AB  - The shift from flood protection to flood risk management, together with
recent arguments on incorporating culture in managing risk, underscores
the application of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in managing
disasters from flood hazards. Yet, documentation and incorporation of
TEK into practice remains a challenge. This article contributes to
addressing this challenge by exploring the existence of TEK to flooding
in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda. Using semi-structured interviews,
data were collected from residents of the Nyamwamba watershed where
intense flash floods caused deadly impacts in May 2013. Collected data
were analysed using content, thematic and interpretive analysis
techniques. Results indicate that TEK is exhibited through various
traditional ecological approaches (TEAs). Although endangered, TEAs
(conducted through collective action for a communally accepted end) are
framed in three main activities: (1) assessment and prediction of
rainfall and flood by the traditional hydro-meteorologist (diviner) and
the traditional rain forecaster (rainmaker); (2) the mountain cleansing
ritual (which act as flood risk awareness platform); and (3) immunising
riverine communities through planting certain indigenous plants, which
improve hydrological systems through their high conservation value for
native ecological diversity. As most TEAs are conducted through
collective action, they represent a platform to understand local
capacities and enhance adoption of measures, and/or a source of
knowledge for new measures to address flood risk. Therefore, full-scale
investigations of these TEAs, determining how relevant TEAs are
fine-tuned, and (scientific) measures enculturated based on fine-tuned
TEAs could result in effective flood risk management in various flood
hotspots where TEAs influence action.

AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been successfully
used in weather prediction, but its ability to simulate precipitation
over areas with complex topography is not optimal. Consequently, WRF has
problems forecasting rainfall events over Chilean mountainous terrain
and foothills, where some of the main cities are located, and where
intense rainfall occurs due to cutoff lows. This work analyzes an
ensemble of microphysics schemes to enhance initial forecasts made by
the Chilean Weather Agency in the front range of Santiago. We first
tested different vertical levels resolution, land use and land surface
models, as well as meteorological forcing (GFS/FNL). The final ensemble
configuration considered three microphysics schemes and lead times over
three rainfall events between 2015 and 2017. Cutoff low complex
meteorological characteristics impede the temporal simulation of
rainfall properties. With three days of lead time, WRF properly
forecasts the rainiest N-hours and temperatures during the event,
although more accuracy is obtained when the rainfall is caused by a
meteorological frontal system. Finally, the WSM6 microphysics option had
the best performance, although further analysis using other storms and
locations in the area are needed to strengthen this result.

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Research on urban flood hydrology-especially in small watersheds-is
urgently needed in response to a dearth of small catchment studies,
rapid urban growth, increased flash flooding, and precipitation
variability. This study compares stormflow between three small
catchments in the South Carolina Sandhills of the USA: two heavily
urbanized, and one forested catchment that serves as a proxy for
pre-urban conditions. Comparisons of runoff volume, runoff coefficient,
peak discharge, and shape of dimensionless unit hydrographs (DUH) show
significantly larger stormflow volume and peak instantaneous discharge
in the urban catchments that exceed those in the forested catchment by
more than an order of magnitude. Changes in hydrograph shapes are
visualized by DUHs and measured by skewness and kurtosis. Urban kurtosis
values of DUHs are significantly higher than forested kurtosis values
(p-values < 0.01) implying a difference in timing of stormflow volumes.
In addition to changes in hydrograph shapes, urban runoff coefficients
are significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than forested values. Urban
times-to-peak were correlated with rainfall duration. Urbanization of
hilly, forested areas with sandy soils, such as the Sandhills

in runoff and peak discharge that result in substantial non-stationarity

T1  - Building socio-hydrological resilient cities against flash floods: Key challenges and a practical plan for arid regions
A1  - Horn, Finlay

Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - The objective of this research is to improve the understanding and
recognition of the management challenges to flash flooding hazards and
the potential adaptive measures within the arid urban areas through a
socio-hydrological framework. Considering the capital of Sudan,
Khartoum, as an example of urban arid areas with increasing flash flood
risk, the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected
from a range of different flood management actors following the 2013 and
2014 flash flood events. The qualitative research methods included
participant observation, expert interviews and focus groups. The main
themes of management challenges recorded included weak institutional
capacity, bad governance, limited resources, and poor urban planning.
These four themes, in turn, included different types of challenges,
among which lack of: civil society engagement and coordination of
actors, political will, data and tools, and effective urban development
strategy shared the highest number of comments from the professional
actors in each theme, respectively. These findings presented a
management perspective to the lessons previously established and learned
from an impact assessment. Accordingly, the amalgamation of all the
lessons learned from the flood research findings enabled a suitable
Master Flash Flood Management Plan (MaFFMaP) to be proposed as a final
product. This plan would operate within an Integrated Flash Flood
Management (IFFM) framework. The facets of the MaFFMaP include steps
toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding
this hazard, aspects for use of these new datasets within a
mixed-measure (structural and non-structural) approach from the
authorities, and programmes for building community and civil society
capacity through improving awareness and engagement. Furthermore, it is
intended that this plan would be a replicable design, which could
therefore be adopted and implemented in the wider context of the urban
arid regions.

T1  - Understanding historical, cultural and religious frameworks of mountain communities and disasters in Nubra valley of Ladakh
A1  - Suri, Kavita
Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - Ladakh, a high altitude cold desert in India inhabited by various ethnic
communities, has become quite vulnerable to environmental hazards like
flash-floods, cloudbursts, snowstorms, landslides etc. This landscape
which has been traditionally dominated by Buddhist and Muslim
communities, has witnessed much devastation in the 2010, 2012 and 2015
flash-floods and cloudbursts which resulted in a big loss of human lives
besides massive infrastructural damages.
The present paper seeks to study the impact of religion, culture,
customs and rituals of this small Himalayan Ladakhi society in directly
or indirectly influencing disaster response and recovery mechanisms. It
would also explore the impact of behavior, perceptions and responses of
Ladakhi communities in times of disasters. The paper seeks to understand
not only the cultural framings in the times of disasters but also its
socio-cultural settings, inter-community relations, government's role
that can influence risk reduction, disaster's Impact on livelihood and
cultural survival.

T1  - Establishing information seeking pathways in slow and flash floods
A1  - Ryan, Barbara
Y1  - 2018///
PD  - 
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate information seeking
behaviour of people involved in slow and flash flood disasters,
specifically how they received the first alert, where they then turned
for more information, and what their main sources and forms were. An
online and mailed survey based on models of problem-specific information
seeking and risk information for natural hazards secured responses from
Australians who had experienced flash flood (n=91) and slow flood
(n=41). It found that information pathways taken by individuals are
different for slow and flash floods, but the set of information forms
and sources used are similar. `Other people', television and news and
weather websites were predominant sources and forms in flash flood, and
online sources, television and radio predominant in slow flood. The
importance of other people and mainstream media (including their online
sites) in information behaviour means that mainstream media should
remain an important component of information efforts by agencies. This
study builds further evidence that disaster type and the media landscape
should be taken into account when developing warning and response
communication strategies, and allows public information officers to
prioritise communication forms during response.

AB  - Global warming may affect the regime of hydroclimatic systems and induce
more frequent occurrences of extremes, such as drought, heat wave and
flood. Apart from the assessment of each extreme, recent decades have
witnessed a surge in the study of compound extremes, i.e., the
concurrence of multiple extremes. To aid the understanding of compound
extremes, a variety of studies has been conducted to assess the
dependence among different variables or extremes. As such, it is
important to model multiple contributing variables of compound extremes
to characterize the associated risk taking into account the dependence.
In this study, a multivariate approach based on the meta-Gaussian model
is proposed for the statistical analysis of compound extremes in the
trivariate case. The application of the proposed approach is illustrated
with the compound drought and hot extreme in the U.S. based on monthly
precipitation, soil moisture and temperature from the North American
Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). The likelihood of the
occurrence of compound drought and hot extreme is assessed based on the
joint distribution, which is shown to be higher in regions with
significant land atmosphere interactions. The impact of precipitation
and temperature on the occurrence of agricultural drought is also
assessed based on the conditional distribution. Overall, results show
that the proposed method provides a useful tool for statistical
assessments of the compound extreme through constructing the joint and
conditional distribution.

PD  - 
AB  - Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) was introduced in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) to account for stress
symptoms appearing within the first month after a trauma exposure.
However, there is scant literature assessing the validity of models
pertaining to ASD, particularly among Asian adolescent samples. This
study aims to address this gap by examining the latent structure of five
proposed models of ASD among adolescent survivors of a deadly flash
flood. Two hundred twenty-five (225) respondents were assessed using the
Acute Stress Disorder Interview within a month after a flash flood
disaster. Series of confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a
five-factor inter-correlated model (dissociation, intrusion, avoidance,
dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal) yielded a more nuanced structure
that portrays the subtleties in the data that are glossed over and
missed by one-factor DSM-5 and even other multifactor models.

AB  - Background: Heavy rainfall in northern India in August 2010 caused flash
floods, seriously damaging homes and infrastructure. There have been no
major disasters in the history of Ladakh, and no surveys on
post-disaster psychiatric disorders have been conducted in this area.
Aims and methods: To examine the impact of this disaster in Ladakh one
month post-disaster, we visited Choglamsar, located near the town of
Leh, where the flood had the most severe impact. In total, 318 survivors
(mean age: 58.6 years; female-male ratio: 59.7%; Tibetan refugees:
86.2%) participated in the survey. We used the two-item Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-2) along with questions covering background
characteristics and disaster exposure. A psychiatrist interviewed the
survivors with a single or double positive score in the PHQ-2 or with
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
Results and conclusion: There were only two PTSD cases and five of major
depressive disorders. PTSD and depression were less common in the
Tibetan cultural areas than in other areas. The social background and
temperamental characteristics of the Tibetan culture may play a
suppressive role in psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Large alluvial fans characterize the piedmonts of the White Mountains,
California-Nevada, USA, with large boulders strewn across their
surfaces. The boulders are interpreted as flash floods deposits with an
unclear trigger for the transport process. Several triggers are
possible, including glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), thunderstorms
or rainfall on snow cover. From a paleoenvironmental perspective, the
origin of the flash floods is of fundamental importance. The alluvial
fans that flank the White Mountains at Leidy Creek display particularly
impressive examples of these deposits. The boulder deposits and the
source catchment at Leidy Creek were examined using Be-10 terrestrial
cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) surface exposure dating to help elucidate their
age and origin. All boulders dated on the alluvial fans date to the
Holocene. This is in accordance with the geomorphic analyses of the
Leidy Creek catchment and its terraces and sediment ridges, which were
also dated to the Holocene using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)
and Be-10 surface exposure. The results suggest that the boulders on the
alluvial fan were deposited by flash floods during thunderstorm events
affecting the catchment of the Leidy Creek valley.
Paleomonsoonal-induced mid-Holocene flash floods are the most plausible
explanation for the discharges needed for these boulder aggradations,
but a regional dataset is needed to confirm this explanation. (C) 2014

T1  - Causes for record high flood losses in the central United States

PD  - 
AB  - Flood losses in the north central United States are the nation's highest
since 1980. Losses in Iowa rank first nationally and those in two
adjacent states rank fourth (Missouri) and sixth (Illinois).
Explanations were sought for this three-state regional maximum of flood
losses, including geophysical, societal, and climatological conditions.
Comparisons of conditions with those of surrounding areas revealed the
three states had more land exposure to the major flood-prone rivers
(Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio) than any other state or group of
states. The region also has a higher population density than surrounding
areas and contains three of the five largest metropolitan areas of the
Midwest. Farm land values rank just behind those of the three states to
the immediate west. Further, the region is the center of the nation's
complex surface and riverine transportation systems that are highly
vulnerable to flooding. The assessment of regional hydroclimatic factors
on enhanced flooding in the three-state region was based on a case study
of historic floods on two adjacent basins located near the center of the
region. Historic flood data showed systematic, long-term increases in
both flood incidence and magnitude. Certain precipitation conditions on
the basins also showed systematic temporal increases since the 1920s,
including annual precipitation, number of seven-day heavy rain events,
and the number of days with precipitation. This climatic shift to more
multi-day periods of heavy rain appears to be the major reason that
hydrologic flooding in the three states has increased since the 1920s.
Analysis of the individual major hydrologic floods revealed five
different types of precipitation conditions, including snowmelt
situations that produced major floods. The primary cause of major floods
was prolonged periods of four- to 13-day durations with intermittent
moderate to heavy rains, and these events often included heavy,
15-centimeter rainstorms capable of producing flash floods. Climatic
data reveal that the three states experience more heavy rain-producing
synoptic weather conditions, cyclonic activity, and intense rainfalls
than do most surrounding states. Collectively, these geophysical,
hydroclimatic, and societal factors combine to cause the high flood
losses in the nation's central region.

T1  - An assessment of distributed flash flood forecasting accuracy using radar and rain gauge input for a physics-based distributed hydrologic model
A1  - Looper, Jonathan P

Y1  - 2012///
PD  - 
AB  - One approach to reducing societal impacts from flooding is to minimize
the public's exposure by closing flooded intersections, and warning
stakeholders. Emergency responders must know when and where flooding is
likely to occur. This article describes the real-time performance of a
flash flood forecasting system for a significant flood event (September
7-8, 2010) in Austin, Texas. The system uses a physics-based distributed
(PBD) hydrologic model, Vflo, together with radar rainfall input to
predict stage and discharge at 222 locations in real-time. A comparison
of model forecast accuracy using the operational rain gauge-adjusted
radar rainfall input (GARR) is made against rain gauge only (RGO) input
for a recent flash flood. A collection of calibrated hydrologic models
for flash flood prone basins, within the City of Austin, is used for the
comparison. A 1.9 h reduction in timing error was achieved using GARR as
input rather than RGO. The RMSE of peak stage forecasts with GARR was
0.89 m, but with RGO input, the peak stage RMSE increased to 1.77 m. The
use of GARR as input to the PBD model not only increases the forecast
lead-time accuracy, but also the accuracy of forecast peak stage across
a range of basin sizes. Rain gauge density over the forecast basins was
one of the main determinants of forecast accuracy during an extreme
event that resulted in significant flooding in a major metropolitan
area. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
