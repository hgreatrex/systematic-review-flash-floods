Abstract = {{Many countries globally have experienced considerable changes in their
   climatic and meteorological conditions, leading to extreme inundation
   extent and increased frequency in flooding. The problems arising range
   from minor impacts, such as frequent flash flooding, to major incidents,
   where larger areas are inundated for several days after a storm event.
   The spilling and flowing of floodwater over these areas can become a
   serious problem, where it can even cause potential risk to human life,
   as well as health and much damage to property. Recently, flood hazard
   relating to vehicles have become more noticeable. Thus, it is desirable
   to assess the hydraulic behaviour and safety degree of vehicles during
   floods using hydrodynamic models. In this paper, the numerical model for
   assessing the flood hazard risk relating to vehicles has been applied to
   establish an understanding of the hydrodynamics of floodwater flows over
   floodplains with vehicles; a condition which can be very important for
   extreme storm events, or even moderate storm events, when the storm
   water system is insufficient to drain away the surface runoff. The
   calibrated and verified numerical model has been included to simulate
   the conditions with different Average Recurrence Intervals (ARI) in a
   real floodplain, at the township of Muar, Johor, Malaysia. Extensive
   investigations have been undertaken to investigate the effects of
   vehicles on floodwater flow propagation over floodplains and, on the
   other hand, the influence of the floodwater flows on the stability of
   model vehicles. The two principal factors of hazards (i.e. the
   floodwater depth and flow velocity) that affect the stability of model
   vehicles have been identified to estimate the flood hazard risk relating
   to vehicles, with the aim of studying the impacts on aspects of the
   hydrodynamic processes. Comparisons of the velocity profiles and water
   elevations have been undertaken. The results have highlighted that the
   model vehicles had a significant impact on the floodwater flow
   propagation and the hydrodynamic processes in the flooded area. The
   numerical model can be readily used to estimate the degree of hydraulic
   stability for vehicles, and it is also invaluable for assessing the
   potential flood hazard risk to vehicles for improved flood risk
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Critical rainfall is one of the most important parameters of prediction,
   forecasting and early warning on mountain torrents disasters with
   important meanings for preventing mountain torrents disasters. In this
   paper, the measured rainfall method was taken to calculate the critical
   rainfall in typical regions based on the rainfall data of typical
   regional meteorological stations. Then, the Inverse Distance Weighting
   spatial interpolation method and Ordinary Kriging Interpolation method
   are taken based on the typical regional critical rainfall to get the
   critical rainfall distribution map of Sichuan Province. The critical
   rainfall distribution maps, which obtained from the two kinds of
   interpolation methods, both have universality and operability. Among
   them, the critical rainfall distribution map mapped by the Ordinary
   Kriging Interpolation method was more consistent with the practical
   situation.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to improve our knowledge of hillslope hydrology. Due to
   frequent heavy monsoon rainfalls in the rainy seasons and the steep
   topographic slopes, Hong Kong suffers the hazards of flash floods almost
   every year, and an improved understanding of hillslope hydrology is
   valuable for flash flood forecasting. To explore the hillslope
   hydrology, in Mid-2007, several automatic rain gauges and one automatic
   water level data-logger were installed at a headwater catchment in Hong
   Kong for providing rainfall and runoff data at the one-minute time step.
   Since then, several severe rainfall hyetographs and related runoff
   hydrographs have been obtained. To make use of the observed hydrological
   data, a numerical model, TOPMODEL, was used to simulate the hydrological
   processes. Further, to determine the model parameters, several field
   surveys have been conducted to collect land cover, soil properties, and
   hydraulic features of the catchment. Then, these data were used to
   investigate various aspects of the catchment's hydrology and in
   particular to study the catchment's precipitation and runoff process.
   The study result reveals there was a significant difference between
   overland flow and baseflow. For the hillslope hydrology, this study
   showed that the overland runoff appears rarely, and the subsurface flow
   formed a dominant part of the flash flooding hydrograph.}},

Abstract = {{Disaster relief management is essential for various types of disasters
   such as terrorist attacks, hazardous materials, hurricanes and flash
   floods. Planning for disaster relief is important in rescuing victims
   with the involvement of many agencies and the public in managing the
   event. This is due to poor coordination, late assistance and uneven
   distribution of vehicles, food, and medical assistants. Time and cost
   are very important in disaster relief. The need for a proper disaster
   relief plan to overcome these issues is crucial. This paper presents a
   two tier solutions to relieve flood victims focuses on the evacuation.
   The first tier is to complete the task of vehicles assignment at the
   inundated area. Then, the routing of vehicles from inundated areas to
   relief centres. A discrete particle swarm optimization were employed and
   tested reflecting the fitness functions identified from each tier. The
   findings show that the two-tier solution provides good results for the

Abstract = {{Strong rainfall events have unquestionably one of the largest economic
   and social impacts of any atmospheric phenomena. The purpose of this
   paper is to simulate the weather conditions associated with the heavy
   precipitation episode during 11-13 March 2002, which generated intense
   rainfall as well as hail and snow in the central and northern regions of
   Continental Portugal. The simulation was carried out using the Regional
   Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), through a three nested grids
   configuration 48 km, 12 km and the highest resolution being 3 km, to
   capture the synoptic and mesoscale circulation patterns. The initial and
   lateral boundary conditions necessary to drive RAMS were taken from the
   Brazilian Center of Weather Prediction and Climate Studies (CPTEC)
   global model forecasts in the form of spectral coefficients with T62
   triangular truncation equivalent to 1.825 degrees resolution in the
   meridional and zonal directions. The model results show that the RAMS
   model is a useful framework to describe the rainfall patterns over the
   region, reproducing the area without rainfall within the domain
   reasonably well, although the model overestimated or underestimated the
   observed values at different periods. The spatial distribution of the
   total accumulated rainfall showed some tendency to predict more
   precipitation over higher elevations, probably influenced by dynamical
   forcing and associated microphysical processes.}},

Abstract = {{With an increasing number of wireless users and applications, overload
   control mechanisms are becoming ever more crucial in control elements
   where heavy congestion can prevent transmission of services on the
   network. During mass communication events and flash crowds resulting not
   only from disasters and media events, but also from social networking
   activities, the lack of proper overload control can result in a flood of
   control messages, and thus deadlock. There is an important need for
   tools to rapidly tune control solutions. In this paper, we present Rapid
   Overload Control Simulation (ROCS), a tool to analyze the efficiency and
   operation of different overload control mechanisms under a variety of
   network and traffic scenarios. The tool is built as a modular,
   expandable platform that models control elements, messaging sequences,
   and processing delays. As a case study, we use the ROCS tool to analyze
   radio network controller (RNC) overload control using a combination of
   overload control methods. (c) 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys with the emerging research on various methods to
   identify the legitimate/illegitimate traffic on the network. Here, the
   focus is on the effective early detection scheme for distinguishing
   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack traffic from normal flash
   crowd traffic. The basic characteristics used to distinguish Distributed
   Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from flash crowds are access intents,
   client request rates, cluster overlap, distribution of source IP
   address, distribution of clients and speed of traffic. Various
   techniques related to these metrics are clearly illustrated and
   corresponding limitations are listed out with their justification. A new
   method is proposed in this paper which builds a reliable identification
   model for flash crowd and DDoS attacks. The proposed Probabilistic
   Neural Network based traffic pattern classification method is used for
   effective classification of attack traffic from legitimate traffic. The
   proposed technique uses the normal traffic profile for their
   classification process which consists of single and joint distribution
   of various packet attributes. The normal profile contains uniqueness in
   traffic distribution and also hard for the attackers to mimic as
   legitimate flow. The proposed method achieves highest classification
   accuracy for DDoS flooding attacks with less than 1\% of false positive
   rate.}},

   high uncertainty of predicting such a type of phenomena leads to using
   various nowcasting methods for estimation of predicted rainfall totals.
   This ``variant-approach{''} was tested on case studies and is going to
   be set up for operational testing for pilot catchments. Detailed case
   studies of two extreme flash floods, which occurred on 24 June 2006, are
   presented and serve to demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of

Abstract = {{Climate changes, irrational exploitation of the land and lack of a
   sustainable protective infrastructure against extreme phenomenological
   phenomena make Romania an area vulnerable to frequent floods. If on the
   middle and low courses of major rivers the hydrotechnical infrastructure
   has been improved in order to prevent against floods, the small water
   courses often remain vulnerable to flash flooding due to the rains with
   a torrential character. Such basins quickly respond to heavy
   precipitations because of the steep slopes and impervious surfaces,
   saturated soils or because of the anthropogenic changes (deforestation
   or fires, for example) that cause changes of the natural drainage. Jifia
   hydrographic basin is an area where the hydrological risk exists and
   manifests itself along both Jiiariver and its tributaries. The

Abstract = {{In semiarid regions with steep morphology and irregular rainfall regime
   areas, the floods are presented with high proportion of solid materials
   transport. Furthermore, climate change will increases flash floods
   phenomenon, and will make necessary to control them to minimize their
   destructive effects. In order to design effective control and intake
   systems in semiarid regions, it is necessary to know hydrologic and
   hydraulic characteristics of ephemeral rivers. According to the problem
   some semi-arid Mediterranean basins were studied in order to establish
   general criteria of calculation in these regions. Based on the results
   obtained in these basins with distributed and aggregated hydrologic
   models, in this paper the authors analyze the main hydrological and
   hydraulic properties, and discuss the formulations of roughness
   coefficients and sediment transport and its application in ephemeral

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean catchments in the south of France are prone to intense
   rainfall leading to destructive flash floods. These rainfalls mainly
   occur in autumn and show a high spatial variability. This study aims to
   assess the quality and impact in hydrological modelling of the radar
   rainfall data, in the Lez catchment (114 km(2)) near Montpellier,
   France. Comparison of both the raingauges and radar data proved to be
   satisfactory for events at the beginning of autumn. In contrast,
   important differences appeared for events occurring at the end of
   autumn. This can be explained by the weak vertical extension of the
   clouds and the low altitude of the 0 degrees C isotherm in this period,
   which could affect the accuracy of radar measurements due to the
   distance between the basin and the radar (similar to 60 km). To take
   advantage of the spatial variability of the radar rainfall data, the
   flood simulations were performed through a distributed event-based
   rainfall runoff model. The model was calibrated using a sample of 21
   floods observed from 1994 to 2008 where both recording raingauge and
   radar rainfall data were available. When the radar rainfalls were
   reliable, they led to: (i) an improvement of the optimal flood
   simulation at the outlet, and (ii) an improvement of the relationship
   between the calibrated initial condition of the model and external
   predictors such as piezometric level, baseflow and Hu2 index from the
   Meteo-France SIM model. Installation of an X-band radar near the study
   area could improve rainfall estimation at the end of the autumn for the
   Lez catchment and the Montpellier agglomeration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to investigate a new way of locating potential impacts
   of flash floods. Mapping surface flow concentrations, using a new metric
   based on a cellular automaton RuiCells, is shown to qualitative align
   with observed and known instances of damage caused by flash floods in 4
   small `dry valleys' located in northern France (Parisian Basin).
   Numerical simulations enable the assessment of the relations between the
   organisation of thalwegs networks and surfaces for a given basin form.
   An index of concentration (IC) allows detecting the confluences in
   upstream of which networks and surfaces are spatially well organised. A
   strong correlation between observed damage, field experiments, local
   knowledge and maps of IC index exists as simulations underline many
   places where flash floods induce important material or human damage and
   where further surface flow concentration results in highly-incised
   gullies. In rare cases, no validation is possible because nobody can
   confirm the degradations.}},

Abstract = {{Gauge data in upland regions of the UK is sparse and often misrepresents
   intense precipitation events over small catchments. The production of
   flash flood warnings relies on high resolution input from the radar
   composite. It is therefore important that radar measurements of rainfall
   rate are as accurate as possible and account for the effects of
   orographic enhancements well. Within the Met Office, the Alpert \&
   Shafir (1989) physically-based method of calculating the orographic
   enhancement of precipitation has recently replaced the previously
   operational climatology based one described by Hill (1983). The Alpert
   \& Shafir model takes into account wind speed, wind direction, relative
   humidity, temperature and the topography of the region. The benefits of
   using a physical model are numerous. The corrections can be defined at
   much higher spatial resolution, with the possibility of introducing new
   fields, such as the vertical wind profile, and making further
   improvements to the physical model. The offline and operational trial
   results, as well as results from a post implementation analysis show
   that accuracy of the precipitation estimates is improved when using
   Alpert \& Shafir's method.}},

   datasets to establish the skill of present flash flood guidance.
   Significant improvements were realised using the forward modelling
   approach. Given the advent of 1-km(2), 5-min radar rainfall
   observations, distributed hydrologic models, and increased computing
   power, all of which are commensurate with the scales of flash flooding,
   it is now possible to directly forecast the probability of flash
   flooding over the conterminous USA in real time.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally characterized a condenser design for a multi-condenser
   loop heat pipe (LHP) capable of dissipating 1000 W The LHP is designed
   for integration into a high performance air-cooled heat sink to address
   thermal management challenges in advanced electronic systems. The
   multi-layer stack of condensers utilizes a sintered wick design to
   stabilize the liquid-vapor interface and prevent liquid flooding of the
   lower condenser layers in the presence of a gravitational head. In
   addition a liquid subcooler is incorporated to suppress vapor flashing
   in the liquid return line. We fabricated the condensers using
   photo-chemically etched Monel frames with Monel sintered wicks with
   particle sizes up to 44 mu m. We characterized the performance of the
   condensers in a custom experimental flow rig that monitors the pressure
   and temperatures of the vapor and liquid. The condenser dissipated the
   required heat load with a subcooling of up to 18 degrees C, while
   maintaining a stable liquid-vapor interface with a capillary pressure of
   6.2 kPa. In the future, we will incorporate the condenser into a loop
   heat pipe for a high performance air-cooled heat sink.}},

Abstract = {{Flood management in Asian cities has conventionally been approached
   through structural intervention where floods are regarded as a threat
   requiring control through engineering infrastructure. Such a command and
   control paradigm represents a marked transition from the way that
   monsoon flood regimes have been traditionally perceived across Asia.
   Rapid urbanization and climate change has imposed increasingly difficult
   flood management challenges as an extension of impermeable surfaces
   generates rapid runoff and flash flooding, while cities expand into
   flood-prone areas. Property and communities are placed at enhanced risk.
   Urbanization reallocates risk as channel and floodplain modification
   influences flood regimes, while demands for flood protection at certain
   locations can redistribute risk to other areas. An increasing concern
   about flood hazard across Asian cities questions whether conventional
   solutions reliant on structural intervention are sustainable. Such
   questioning is mirrored by an alternative paradigm of rehabilitation in
   integrated river basin management - a recognition that restoring and
   sustaining functional river ecosystems with high biodiversity is one of
   the greatest challenges facing society. Rehabilitation initiatives
   demand a new approach to river basin management which encourage
   interdisciplinary activity, particularly between engineers,
   hydrologists, geomorphologists and ecologists. The paper sets out some
   preliminary ideas from a research project investigating the potential
   for river rehabilitation as a central tenet of flood management, with a
   particular focus on Asian cities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method of the reproduction of flash flood events
   with high Froude number. Based on the method of characteristics, it is
   common to give two hydrographs of depth and discharge (or velocity) at
   the upstream boundary to reproduce unsteady super-critical flows.
   Contrary to the common theory in Fundamental Hydraulics, we considered
   to reproduce flash flood events using only one depth hydrograph at one
   site in a river course. We previously proved the possibility to
   reproduce flood flows for sub-critical flows using one depth hydrograph
   at one middle site between upstream and downstream boundaries, and also
   proposed the practical method of computation for real flood flows. In
   this paper, we conducted the theoretical considerations under the
   idealized conditions to extend the method to unsteady super-critical
   flows.}},

   index. The assessment cells with type of vector plane and raster point
   were explained. The methods, such as analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy
   synthetic evaluation and spatial analysis, were used to establish a
   valuation model for potential flash flood disaster risk of Sub-basin.
   Run this model, the Flood Risk Map in the aim basin can be drawn
   automatically through the development of Arc GIS by Arc Engine. Flood
   disasters risk of a sub-basin lack of flood data in Huai River was
   evaluated with the application of this model, from the result, we can

Abstract = {{Suspension line Old bridges are rare exception in our country.
   Researching this kind's old bridge is very interest to the bridge
   scholar. Zhejiang Yucheng bridge, located in Shengzhou of Shaoxing city,
   it is a typical suspension line bridge structure; it has been 150 years
   of history. Despite the impact of flash floods for so far, but, at
   present, it is still good for normal used, only local stone blocked off.
   Based on this old suspension line bridge, measuring the bridge size
   data, using the finite element software ANSYS for the modal analysis,
   the calculation results show that the fundamental frequency as 19.650Hz,
   and ten vibration modes and frequency bands can be obtained. In the end,
   about the reinforced methods are study, such as foreign adhesive steel
   and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), pressure grouting way on the
   gap and so on. All of this may be help for old suspension line bridges
   research and reinforced.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of off-the-shelf buoyant
   fluorescent microspheres as particle tracers in turbid water flows.
   Microspheres' fluorescence intensity is experimentally measured and
   detected in static aqueous suspensions of increasing concentrations of
   clay to simulate typical conditions of natural drainage networks. We
   conduct experiments by using photoconductive cells and image-based
   sensing methods. Results obtained with both approaches exhibit
   comparable trends and show that the considered particles are detectable
   in critically turbid water flows. Further information on the performance
   and integration of such microspheres in low-cost measurement
   instrumentations for field observations is obtained through experiments
   on a custom built water channel. Findings from this study show that the
   proposed technology may serve as a minimally invasive sensing system for
   hazardous events, such as pollutant diffusion in natural streams and
   flash flooding due to extreme rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{Water scarcity is a common problem throughout the Southwestern United
   States. Rainwater Harvesting (RWH), in urban and suburban environments,
   has potential to conserve existing water resources and reduce flash
   flooding. Currently, little is understood on how to effectively access
   this untapped resource. However, participants of a Common Pool Resource
   (CPR) can achieve resource efficiencies greater than 90 percent.
   An exhaustive search of published materials was conducted, coupled with
   communications with the Texas Water Development Board, Edwards Aquifer
   Authority, San Antonio Water System, and other municipal water
   utilities.
   Analysis of CPRs and their design principals reveals that only the
   Edwards Aquifer Authority and its associated Groundwater Districts
   constitutes a functioning groundwater CPR in Texas. Of the CPR design
   principals, only effective monitoring requires engineering.
   Under the correct circumstances, it would be more appropriate to view
   RWH as a nested enterprise inside a functioning CPR. This paper explores
   the possibilities and difficulties of engineering associated with RWH as
   a nested enterprise in a CPR, specifically RWH in the Edwards Aquifer.
   A CPR success depends on management rather than engineering. Success of
   a CPR and its nested enterprises depends on participant behavior.
   Economic models, based on the mathematics of game theory, help
   understand how participants of a CPR respond to issues of fairness and
   communication.
   A cost effective device can provide effective monitoring of RWH
   performance. Once monitoring is provided, RWH can be integrated into
   existing cooperative CPR institutions.}},

   dynamics of the storm motion over the catchment, reflecting the
   filtering effect of the catchment morphology with respect to the storm
   kinematics. Catchment-scale storm velocity is quantified for the 29
   August 2003 extreme storm that occurred on the 600 km(2) Fella basin in
   the eastern Italian Alps. A spatially distributed rainfall runoff model
   is used to evaluate the effects of the storm velocity on flood modelling
   for four sub-basins. It is shown that storm velocity exhibits rather
   moderate values, in spite of the strong kinematic characteristics of
   individual storm elements. Consistent with this observation, hydrologic
   simulations show that storm motion has an almost negligible effect on
   the flood response modelling.}},

Abstract = {{Automated watering systems provide a reliable source of ad libitum water
   to animal cages. Our facility uses an automated water delivery system to
   support approximately 95\% of the housed population (approximately
   14,000 mouse cages). Drinking valve failure rates from 2002 through 2006
   never exceeded the manufacturer standard of 0.1\% total failure, based
   on monthly cage census and the number of floods. In 2007, we noted an
   increase in both flooding and cases of clinical dehydration in our mouse
   population. Using manufacturer's specifications for a water flow rate of
   25 to 50 mL/min, we initiated a wide-scale screening of all valves used.
   During a 4-mo period, approximately 17,000 valves were assessed, of
   which 2200 failed according to scoring criteria (12.9\% overall; 7.2\%
   low flow; 1.6\% no flow; 4.1\% leaky). Factors leading to valve failures
   included residual metal shavings, silicone flash, introduced debris or
   bedding, and (most common) distortion of the autoclave-rated internal
   diaphragm and O-ring. Further evaluation revealed that despite normal
   autoclave conditions of heat, pressure, and steam, an extreme negative
   vacuum pull caused the valves' internal silicone components (diaphragm
   and O-ring) to become distorted and water-permeable. Normal flow rate
   often returned after a `drying out' period, but components then
   reabsorbed water while on the animal rack or during subsequent autoclave
   cycles to revert to a variable flow condition. On the basis of our
   findings, we recalibrated autoclaves and initiated a preventative
   maintenance program to mitigate the risk of future valve failure.}},

Abstract = {{More than 300 000 people live in the Loire valley, protected from the
   usual floods by high dikes, but also under the constant threat of a
   flash-flood caused by a breach which would give no chance to evacuate on
   time. So a preventive evacuation must be decided and completed before
   such a breach occurs but the authorities would have to assume the heavy
   consequences if in the end, no such breach happens. (I)
   The decision to evacuate must be based on an unambiguous criteria, when
   the predicted level of the flood rises above a safe level, indicating a
   likely breach in the dikes. (II)
   Alas, neither the flood prediction models nor the dike-breach detection
   plans are free of uncertainties. A way to resolve the combined
   uncertainties is to use the measured level of a known flood on D-day,
   and then try to evaluate the errors inherent to the models and the
   accuracy of D-Day predictions using information from D-1,D-2, ... (III)
   Thus, the evacuation plan is designed in successive steps, building on
   the certainties coming for observational data while keeping the capacity
   to reverse as much of the process as long as possible. (IV)}},

Abstract = {{By using the high-resolution observation data and MM5 model simulation
   data, the analysis on the 12 June 2008 Guangxi flash-flood rainstorm
   shows that the associated major mesoscale weather system of this event
   is a quasi-stationary mesoscale vortex, which resulted from the
   interaction between the midlatitude synoptic-scale waves in the westerly
   belt and the low-latitude warm-moist flow under the terrain effect. The
   genesis, development, and movement of the mesoscale vortex have
   significant impacts on the intensity and persistence of the severe
   precipitation from the Guangxi flash-flood rainstorm. This vortex is
   characterized by the coexistence of strong vorticity and divergence with
   the same order of magnitude. Well organized, deep, and moist convection
   was observed for a long period of time, and was produced by the
   interaction between the mesoscale vortex and the gravity waves. The
   latter was generated by the terrain effect and the ageostrophic effect
   of high winds in the low-level jet. According to the quasi-balanced
   dynamical theory, quasi-balanced flow must have existed in the mesoscale
   motions with both divergent and rotational winds. Thus, based on the
   diagnosis of the quasi-balanced flow, the PV-omega inversion method is
   employed to analyze the organized moist convection. The results show
   that 50\%-70\% of the vertical circulation in the rainstorm areas was
   quasi-balanced, so the quasi-balanced flow could well reflect features
   of the strong vertical motions associated with the coexistence of
   vorticity and divergence during this event.}},

Abstract = {{Dams are common structures in order to guarantee water supply and
   control flash floods in Mediterranean mountainous watersheds. Even
   though they are known to modify in space and time the natural regimen of
   natural flows, little has been said about local effects on the ecosystem
   along the river banks upstream the dam. In 2002, Rules dam (southern
   Spain) started to function. This work presents the effects of the dam
   filling on the water balance in flood plains. The influence of the
   enhanced soil moisture in the surroundings of the free surface of the
   reservoir on the vegetation cover status was analyzed and related to
   meteorological agents and topographic features, before and after the
   construction of the dam. Meteorological, topographic, soil and land use
   data were analyzed in the contributing area of the dam, together with
   Landsat TM images during the period 1984-2010 to derive NDVI values.
   Results showed higher NDVI values (close to 20-30\%) once the dam was
   filled and NDVI values in very dry years similar to the ones obtained in
   medium-wet years prior to the construction. Besides, NDVI values after
   the filling of the dam proved to be highly related to meteorological
   variables. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out in order
   to identify individual and combined interactions of meteorological and
   dam-derived effects. 85\% of the total variance can be explained with
   the combination of three Principal Components (PC) in which the first
   one includes the combination of NDVI, meteorological (rainfall) and
   hydrological variables (interception, infiltration, evapotranspiration
   from the soil), whilst the second and third PC mainly include
   topographic features. These results quantify the dam influence along the
   river banks and the superficial recharge effects in dry years.}},

   floods on the wadi Aday, Sogreah Consultants, on behalf of the Ministry
   of Regional Municipalities and Water Resources, designed an ambitious
   development scheme based on the construction of seven dams. The main dam
   in this scheme is equipped with a labyrinth spillway with a flow
   capacity of 5850 m(3)/s. The design of this complex structure was
   initially based on technical literature before being refined through a

Abstract = {{Sediment-laden flows over erodible bed normally feature multiple time
   scales. The time scales of sediment transport and bed deformation
   relative to the flow essentially measure how fast sediment transport
   adapts to capacity regime in line with local flow scenario and the bed
   deforms as compared to the flow, which literally dictate if a capacity
   based and/or decoupled model is justified. This paper synthesizes the
   recently developed multiscale theory for sediment-laden flows over
   erodible bed, with bed load and suspended load transport respectively.
   It is unravelled that bed load transport can adapt to capacity
   sufficiently rapidly even under highly unsteady flows and thus a
   capacity model is mostly applicable, whereas a non-capacity model is
   critical for suspended sediment because of the lower rate of adaptation
   to capacity. Physically coupled modeling is critical for cases
   characterized by rapid bed variation. Applications are outlined on flash
   floods and landslide dam break floods.}},

Abstract = {{Taiwan is located in an area where frequently changing weather
   conditions threaten the lives and properties of its residents. With
   global warming, concentrated rains and extreme weathers bring about more
   frequent flash floods and debris flows, and destroy more bridges. This
   study describes the first ever full-scale experiment to determine the
   lateral displacements of abandoned bridge piers during push-over tests.
   In addition to cable position transducers and a LVDT, a high speed 3D
   terrestrial laser scanner was placed in the riverbed to scan the test
   pier, the reaction pier, and the reference steel frame. The results
   showed that not only can the laser scanner detect and measure the pier
   displacements at specific points, but it can also provide the
   displacement measurements of the entire test pier from top to bottom,
   thus generating more measurement data of the pier deformation behavior
   for further analysis than the cable position transducers or the LVDT
   alone. Other benefits of using the laser scanner include the
   determination of the relative displacements between the test pier and
   the reaction pier and the 3D realistic visualization of the experiment
   site. It is believed that the terrestrial laser scanner can play
   important roles in future large-scale structural experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid screening of flash flood-affected watersheds in Hungary. Flood
   events in small mountain watersheds, called flash floods, have been
   documented rather frequently over the past decades in many parts of the
   world. Despite the country's relative flatness, floods of this type have
   also been reported from the hilly and low mountain catchments of
   Hungary. To avoid flash-flood-triggered losses, development of a flash
   flood guidance (FFG) system was proposed by the concerned authorities.
   To generate a rapid screening-based nationwide vulnerability map as part
   of the FFG system, so-called passive environmental factors are
   considered and discussed in the present study, i.e. those that change
   insignificantly with time. These factors include topographical (slope
   angle and slope range), land use and land cover (vegetation, soil
   physical properties, topsoil thickness and limestone areas) and
   hydrological factors (number of tributary rivers and stream density).
   Vulnerability level is presented in two ways: (i) interpolation among
   the outflow points of the individual watersheds (OFPI based) and (ii) on
   the basis of individual watersheds (WSB type).
   The obtained vulnerability maps largely differ from each other depending
   on their way of representation, and the number of vulnerability classes.
   The majority of the resulting maps appropriately reflect the most flash
   flood-impacted areas of Hungary and indicate the areas for which flash
   flood events have already been documented.}},

   flood peak allowed potential model application that included flood peak
   estimation. The analysis of water pollution through sample sediment was
   helped by spectroscopy techniques and it was found that the flood was
   the main cause of many chemical elements in water. The floods affected
   the quality of water in the Tarim River where it was slightly basic with
   pH = 8.1 before flooding and acidic with pH = 6.9 after flooding.}},

Abstract = {{Fluvial landforms are developed due to river action and these processes
   help in understanding the development of various landforms on the
   earth's surface. Gangetic plain is vast alluvial tract made up of sand,
   silt and clay. This region receives heavy rainfall causing flash floods
   which results in bank-line shifting as well as various
   fluvio-geomorphological changes. Fluvial processes such as erosion and
   deposition not only play an important role in shaping of different
   fluvial landscapes but also contribute towards the braiding and
   meandering pattern which causes change in the flow pattern of the river
   channel. Transportation and deposition of the suspended load also
   contributes towards such changes. The present work describes various
   fluvio-geomorphological features and their changes during different time
   intervals in and around Ballia and Rudrapur. The paper also deals in
   understanding the problems like bank-line shifting, erosion and
   deposition caused by the continuous change in the fluvial patterns, bank
   erosion and sedimentation in this region over past 8 decades.}},

Abstract = {{The mesoscale weather system which affected the Guangxi
   flash-flood-producing rainstorm of China in June 2008 is a
   quasi-stationary mesoscale vortex. Its genesis and development is
   closely related to the coupling effects of weather systems in different
   scales and different latitudes. On the one hand, the coupling of
   synoptic scale high- and low-level jets provides the environmental
   conditions for development of vortices and vertical circulations in the
   mesoscale vortex; On the other hand, the coupling of waves in
   mid-latitude westerlies and perturbations in low-latitude warm-moist
   flow under the influence of complex terrain makes the mesoscale vortex
   circulations strengthened. With the piecewise potential vorticity (PV)
   inversion method, PV anomalies in different regions are analyzed; also
   the vortex-vortex interactions and vortex-background flow interactions
   are diagnosed. Thus, the reasons why the mesoscale is quasi-stationary
   at first, while developing and deepening later are indicated. Under the
   condition of coupling effects, the vertical motions accompanied with the
   mesoscale vortex can be diagnosed with the PV-omega inversion system
   based on the analysis of quasi-balanced flow.}},

Abstract = {{The present study focuses on the impact generated by flash floods within
   the mountain area of the Mures hydrographic basin, namely by analyzing
   the data offered by the hydrographical station of Stanceni regarding
   measurements of the hazards and the economical and environmental
   aspects. Thus, the study is directed towards the representative
   flash-floods that occurred during the years of 1970, 1975, 1995, 1998,
   and 2005.
   The comparative analysis of the hazard involves hydrograph reference
   regarding the largest floods to be recorded in the years of 1970, 1975,
   1995, 1998, and 2005 in the upper river basin of Mures, including the
   flow rates, the volumes transported, the growth and decay duration as
   well as reports to the total duration of the floods in the study.
   The vulnerability of the area is influenced by the population density,
   which is lower as compared to the plain area crossed by the river Mures
   mainly in it's middle and lower sector, and the area's economical
   development.
   The effects of the major flash floods are reflected within the amount of
   damage caused in the studied area.
   The paper finally states the structural and non-structural measures that
   have been taken in order to reduce the impact that flash-floods have
   upon the upper side of the Mures river basin, within the county of
   Mures.}},

Abstract = {{Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) is increasingly being used as a
   reliable tool for dating fluvial deposits, with special relevance in the
   use for recent deposits due to the lack of alternative geochronological
   methods. This work presents a study on the OSL characteristics of sand
   sediments deposited by flash floods during the last 200 years in the
   Guadalentin River (Southeast Spain). Two problems can be anticipated in
   the luminescence properties for dating such recent flood deposits. The
   first problem is poor bleaching due to short duration of flood-flash
   flows and short transport distance along the catchment headwater.
   Second, a geological setting dominated by carbonate bedrock limits the
   amount of quartz grains suitable for age dating. This study aimed to
   provide a preliminary analysis of luminescence diagnostic parameters of
   these young samples that might show an irregular OSL behavior. These
   preliminary OSL tests point out that further improvements such as single
   grain analysis may provide more accurate D-e values than the performed
   multigrain aliquots and might be the appropriated procedure for dating
   these flash-flood deposits.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, to identify circulation patterns producing flash flood in
   the South-West of Iran, 51 large floods in the Qantareh Station have
   been selected which have been among the data from the daily flood in a
   period of 30 years of Mond basin. The Mond basin is one of the sub-basin
   of Persian Gulf Basin and is located in south west of Iran. Then, the
   hydrologic features of selected floods have been calculated. Afterwards,
   hydrologic features of these floods using mean and standard deviation
   have been standardized. Then performing a cluster analysis via Ward
   integration method the data of six main groups of flood have been
   derived. Finally one day was determined as a sample day of each group to
   perform synoptic analysis of precipitation days causing the flood of
   sample day via the environment-to-circulation procedure. To analyze
   precipitation days synoptically, maps of sea level pressure(SLP),
   geopotential height, temperature, specific moisture of 500 hPa level and
   Isohyets maps of daily basin have been used. The upper atmosphere data
   have been provided from NCEP\textbackslash{}NCAR database. In this
   paper, only the synoptic analysis of precipitation days of sample flood
   of flood cluster number 4 is provided. The results showed that
   precipitation cluster providing sample flood of flood cluster number 4
   were due to synoptic conditions of locating a cut-oil low in the East
   Mediterranean and South of Black Sea.}},

   hazardous geomorphic and hydrological processes, such as rock falls,
   landslides, debris flow, soil erosion, snow avalanches, flash floods and
   cloudbursts on higher ridges. Risk assessment is carried out by
   evaluating the vulnerability and types of hazards existing in the
   region. The Upper Bhagirathi basin, particularly between Uttarkashi town
   and Gaumukh, has been selected. A separate hazard map was drawn and
   superimposed using the GIS technique. The main basin and areas close to
   the road in Upper Bhagirathi basin lie in the category of very high risk
   zone. The regions along tributaries of the Bhagirathi River, and away
   from the national highway, lie in the moderate risk zone. The increasing
   intensity of anthropogenic activities may contribute to the fragility
   and the vulnerability to flooding and challenges to downstream water
   resource management. The afforestation programme should be promoted on
   the vulnerable slopes to mitigate the risks.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter looks at the distribution and functioning mechanisms of
   wetlands, temporary lakes, and saline lakes.
   Wetland areas are found on all continents and coastal regions. They are
   ecotones that have important quantitative effects on hydrological cycles
   and biodiversity. They function as important regulatory systems in
   biogeochemical cycles.
   A classification system for wetland areas is presented and their role in
   the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus is discussed. Organisms'
   adaptations to these areas are presented and methods to evaluate the
   impacts that occur in them are discussed.
   Wetland areas are used by humans as sources of renewable natural
   resources (fishing, harvesting products, and aquaculture).
   Temporary waters occur on all continents, in the form of lagoons, ponds,
   and intermittent rivers. The flora and fauna in these waters present
   special characteristics and adaptations for tolerance to drought and
   flash floods.
   The production of resistant eggs that can tolerate long-term droughts is
   one of the important characteristics of organisms in temporary waters.
   Saline lakes are found in arid and semi-arid regions, in endorheic
   areas. The chemical composition of these lakes and their fauna and flora
   and trophic relationships are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Poor levels of reciprocity (or ``upstream/downstream{''} situations) are
   believed to discourage responsible actions and thus make sustainability
   harder to achieve. This paper presents a study that compares land use
   management resulting from concurrent reflexive reciprocal and
   nonreciprocal relationships in a Haitian watershed. The watershed is
   typically nonreciprocal in that flash floods and debris flows affecting
   the lowlands are thought to be initiated by upslope land management. It
   differs from conventional nonreciprocal cases in that the majority of
   people living in the lowlands own or otherwise manage upslope land.
   Concepts of reciprocity and self-interest indicate that
   downslope-residing land managers should implement more upland
   hazard-reduction conservation practices than upslope-residing land
   managers. This idea was tested using data on the number of soil
   conservation measures applied to upslope land parcels. The resulting
   multilevel model demonstrated that downslope households report employing
   more soil conservation measures in their upslope fields than upslope
   households. Additional communal actions to increase assurances of
   working in concert, however, are still needed to reduce disaster
   vulnerability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to analyze flood induced rainfall
   characteristics in the Upper Nan Watershed. The results revealed that
   the mean annual rainfall of the Upper NanWatershed ranged between
   1,083.9 to 2,335.7 mm; however, the high mountain area at the upper part
   had a greater chance of the mean annual rainfall than the undulated area
   at the central and lower part of the watershed. The onset rainy season
   (OSM: May to June) and the rainy season (SM: July to September) yielded
   the maximum rainfall amount (25.6\% and 54.5\% of mean annual rainfall).
   The synoptic conditions, that influenced the rainfall characteristics in
   this area, were AITCZ, WITCZ, AITCZ-D\&L2, ASW and WSW. The results of
   this study indicated that the Upper Part of Mae Nam Nan Subwatershed and
   Nam Yoa 1 Subwatershed were the most flash flood risk area from the
   heavy raining conditions of the Upper Nan Watershed.}},

Abstract = {{The European Parliament presented a Directive (2007/60/CE), related with
   the evaluation and management of flood risks. The document intends to
   reduce the risk of damaging consequences associated to floods in human
   being health and lives, environment, cultural patrimony, economic
   activities and infra-structures. This risk is calculated as the product
   of the probability of flooding with its (damaging) consequences.
   Flooding is defined as water covering land that usually is not covered
   by water. This definition includes coastal, river and estuarine areas.
   Waves action on natural coastlines is influenced by numerous parameters,
   such as wave energy, tides, bathymetry and topography, shoreline
   morphology and sediment budget, to name a few. Similarly, a large number
   of factors can be associated with river flood risk, such as land
   occupation, topography and meteorological conditions. This paper
   presents storm surges and river floods impacts and mitigation
   strategies, highlighting the actual knowledge to reduce floods damaging
   to infrastructure or property, and cause lower human and economic
   losses.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, non-structural measures based on Early Warning Systems
   increasingly play a relevant role in hydrogeological risk mitigation.
   Consequently, modelling of all the phenomena related to floods and
   landslides induced by rainfall, should be developed, with the aim of
   gaining accurate simulations and forecasting the events with a lag time
   large enough for activating civil protection measures. Indeed, in all
   the cases where the phenomenon rapidly evolves, like flash floods or
   shallow landslides, the lag time between observed rainfall and flood or
   landslide occurrence can be too short and must be extended by rainfall
   fields forecasting. The paper describes several mathematical models,
   developed at CAMILab laboratory of ``Dipartimento di Difesa del
   Suolo{''} (University of Calabria), which are operating into Early
   Warning Systems. The models represent different processes and are
   integrated in order to firstly provide the nowcasting of precursor
   (rainfall) and then the occurrence evaluation of induced phenomena
   (floods and landslides). As regards rainfall nowcasting, stochastic
   models (temporal and space-time ones) and a coupled meteorological and
   stochastic model are illustrated. According to space-time scale and data
   availability, flood forecasting for real time warnings can be performed
   by using different rainfall runoff models. Finally, for triggering
   conditions of landslides, a hydrological model and a complete landslide
   are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Debris and hyper-concentrated flows are among the most destructive of
   all water-related disasters. They mainly affect mountain areas in a wide
   range of morphoclimatic environments and in recent years have attracted
   more and more attention from the scientific and professional communities
   and concern from public awareness, due to the increasing frequency with
   which they occur and the death toll they claim. In this context,
   achieving a set of debris and hyper-concentrated flow constitutive
   equations is a task that has been given particular attention by
   scientists during the second half of the last century.
   In relation to these issues, this paper reviews the most updated and
   effective geotechnical and fluid-dynamic procedures nowadays available,
   suitable to predict the triggering and mobilising processes of these
   phenomena, and proposes a mathematical model that is able to assess the
   depth of the wave and the velocities of the liquid and solid phases of
   both non-stratified (mature) and stratified (immature) flows following
   flash-floods and dam-break events in one and two dimensional cases.
   Different experimental cases of dam-break situations in a square section
   channel were considered for the purpose of comparing results.
   These tools will allow, on one hand, to better focus on what to observe
   in the field and, on the other hand, to improve both mitigation measures
   and hazard mapping procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Extra-tropical cyclones that develop near the east coast of Australia
   often have severe consequences such as flash flooding and damaging winds
   and seas, as well as beneficial consequences such as being responsible
   for heavy rainfall events that contribute significantly to total
   rainfall and runoff. There is subjective evidence that the development
   of most major events, commonly known as East Coast Lows, is associated
   with the movement of a high amplitude upper-tropospheric trough system
   over eastern Australia. This paper examines a number of
   upper-tropospheric diagnostic quantities that might provide a basis for
   preparing a climatology of the large-scale drivers of east-coast
   cyclogenesis. A preliminary climatology of these diagnostic quantities,
   based on ECMWF interim reanalyses, is compared with a database of
   observed East Coast Low events. The potential application of these
   diagnostics to global climate model simulations of past and future
   climates is also discussed.}},

Title = {{Moving Substrate in an Ephemeral Stream Case Study in Bridge Survival}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{2201}},
Pages = {{3-9}},
Abstract = {{A case study concerns a small bridge site in an arid area where ongoing
   inhibition of the transport of bed load sediment has caused chronic
   problems and maintenance issues for many years. The crossing of
   Guadalupe Arroyo by US-62-180 exhibits many unusual and important
   characteristics that are seldom seen in one place. Guadalupe Arroyo is
   an ephemeral stream in a very arid area. The stream originates high on
   the east slopes of the Guadalupe Mountains of Texas, where the watershed
   is subject to rainfall generated by orographic lift. The stream
   traverses several miles of arid land and ultimately disappears into a
   dry lake. It is subject to severe flash flooding because of the slope
   and orographic effects of the mountains, and it apparently transports
   large amounts of widely graded material (silt to boulder sized). A
   bridge across this stream was constructed for US-62-180 in 1959. Since
   that construction, the stream has exhibited symptoms of instability in
   the reach around the bridge, manifesting as chronic, severe aggradation
   accompanied by widening, avulsion, and bank erosion. Evidence exists of
   large magnitude transport of very large particles on a regular basis, to
   the extent of requiring protection of the piles from boulder impacts.
   Maintenance forces have continually removed accumulated bed material
   from the bridge opening and the reach immediately upstream. A large lens
   of bed material has accumulated upstream and extends approximately 1,000
   ft (305 m) from the bridge. This site presents a rare opportunity to
   study an extreme case of the inadvertent inhibition of the transport of
   bed material in an ephemeral desert stream by the construction of an
   otherwise ordinary and innocuous highway bridge.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most difficult tasks in field of operative hydrology is the
   prediction of occurrence and course of flash floods. It is difficult to
   predict torrential rainfalls because of their character. Usage of the
   nowcasting methods (weather forecast with two hour validity) holds hope.
   The torrential rainfall prediction should be followed by a suitable
   hydrological model able to estimate at least the resultant peak outflow.
   The hydrological models construction interferes with high measure of
   uncertainty, inherent in the rainfall prediction, rainfall-runoff
   process and its simulation. The way how to eliminate influence of
   uncertainty is using fuzzy logic and other artificial intelligence
   methods. The fuzzy model was compiled through the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in
   the developmental environment of MATLAB. A model was calibrated with the
   help of genetic algorithm, neural networks and different optimization
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Many historical arch bridges are situated in Mountain regions. Such
   historical bridges may be exposed to several natural hazards such as
   flash floods with dead wood and debris flows. For example, in the year
   2000 a heavy debris flow destroyed an arch bridge in Log Pod Mangartom,
   Slovenia and only recently, in September 2008 an arch bridge was
   overflowed by a debris flow. A new launched research project at the
   University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna tries
   to combine advanced numerical models of debris flows with advanced
   models of historical masonry arch bridges under horizontal loads. The
   research project starts with separate finite element modelling of
   different structural elements of arch bridges such as spandrel walls,
   the arch itself, roadway slabs, pavements and foundations under single
   and distributed horizontal loads. Furthermore miniaturized tests are
   planned to investigate the behaviour of the overall bridge under debris
   flow impacts. The results will be used to combine the modelling of the
   different structural elements considering the interaction during a
   horizontal loading. Furthermore this bridge model will then be combined
   with debris flow simulation. Also earlier works considering horizontal
   ship impacts against historical arch bridges will be used control. The
   paper will present latest research results.}},

Abstract = {{Flood warnings provide a well established way to help to reduce the
   risks to life and property during flood events. Hydrological forecasts
   are often used as a component of flood warning systems, and can improve
   the accuracy of warnings and the lead time available, giving more time
   to protect property and evacuate areas at risk. The lead time may also
   be extended by using Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts and other
   meteorological forecasts. The types of hydrological models which are
   used include rainfall-runoff, flow routing and hydrodynamic models, as
   well as more empirical approaches, such as peak to peak correlations.
   Models are usually operated within a forecasting system which gathers
   data, schedules model runs, and post-processes model outputs into
   map-based and other products. Data assimilation techniques are also
   widely used both to initialize model runs, and in the post-processing of
   model outputs. This chapter provides an introduction to these topics,
   and discusses developing areas such as decision support systems for
   flood event management, and the use of ensemble flood forecasts.}},

   mathematical model of free surface unsteady water flow the shallow water
   equations are assumed. Two methods of build-up area representation in
   numerical model are presented in the paper exclusion of the buildings
   from the numerical mesh of flow area and substitution the buildings with
   high friction zones. In order to assess the quality of the numerical
   results obtained using both methods the flow in the model city area with
   the building group representing a simplified town configuration was
   simulated. The numerical results were examined against the experimental
   data available due to laboratory depth measurements. The experiment of
   model city flooding event was carried out at the hydraulic laboratory of

Abstract = {{Flood issue in Yellow River basin has been a prevalent topic for
   thousands of years. As part of it, the Yiluo River basin located at the
   mid - lower catchment plays a key role by controlling the flow that
   merges into the main river. This study concerns with an integrated
   modelling method in the Yiluo River basin which comprehensively applies
   cutting - edge GIS technique, advanced hydrological and hydraulics
   modelling using SOBEK tools, multi - reservoir - based optimisation
   operations and the link to numerical weather predictions that can
   simulate flow situations and find out the utilities of operational flood
   management in preventing or mitigating the flood situation in the Yiluo
   River basin.
   A SOBEK RR/1D/2D model was partly calibrated with a historical storm
   event started from 04:00, 26th, July 1996 to 23:00, August 9th, 1996 and
   finally stopped with a high correlation of 0. 97 at basin outlet
   Heishiguan station. Both structure and non - structure measurements were
   used as two integrated SOBEK - based model applications: multi -
   reservoir - based operation rules which were tested by a C \# program
   giving the optimised results for SOBEK scenario simulations in
   downstream flash flood controlling, and a study linked to numerical
   weather predictions showing the result comparisons from using two
   different methods: rain gauge local weather observation and MM5 local
   weather prediction, thus the application provided with the capability of
   such an integrated flood forecasting system in extending forecast lead
   time.
   From this research it is possible to provide a computational support for
   flood control and management, as well as to minimize the damage caused
   by flash flood and save people' s lives, although more investigations
   are suggested.}},

   melt on the break of March and April. After one month evaluating of
   spring melt another two large flood episodes came on and subsequently
   affected almost whole area under Morava River Board, s.e.
   administration. Interval between these episodes was not even one month.
   And during July and August we registered several other flash floods.
   Handlings on the hydraulic structures (HS) in the frame of higher
   discharges are continually proceeding and hydraulic structures approves
   its significance and importance.
   For flood situations we prepare continually, however absolute flood

Abstract = {{Flash floods from the severe storms that have occurred in years 2009 and
   2010 brought material damages and risk for the affected areas
   inhabitants. Flood risk assessment and prediction are well-developed
   solutions of the natural hazards but flash floods from severe storms are
   quite complicated issue in the sense of their proper prediction. Flash
   floods are beyond the resolution of the numerical weather forecast
   systems (NWFS). Another big issue is fact, that runoff of flash floods
   is frequently outside of the river channels. The complex and
   multi-perspective analysis of the landscape response to the severe storm
   and high-precipitation intensity seems to be effective basis. Results of
   our work is the prototype of methodology and application of the early
   warning system based on GIS, hydrological modeling and effective
   analysis of the radar and NWFS products, which could work in the
   regional scale opposite to local early warning systems.}},

   recurrent flash flooding. This report is directed towards developing a
   methodology for flood risk assessment and relative vulnerability
   classification for watersheds associated with wadi systems in arid
   regions. Geographic Information System (GIS) is used as the main
   analysis tool for modeling Qena area. Watersheds in the study area have
   been identified, and geomorphology parameters and watershed
   characteristics have been estimated. Different parameters, which mostly
   affect the runoff, have been calculated. The HBV rainfall runoff model
   has been calibrated and used to define the flash flood vulnerable areas
   at the catchment. The results of flood risk classification compared well
   with the estimated runoff peak discharge. GIS has proved, as expected,
   to be an easy and efficient toll for watersheds flood risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, rapid development of the Klang Valley has tended to squeeze
   settlement developments into fragile areas, particularly flood plains,
   due to the limited supply of suitable non-hazardous land. Developments
   on these flood plains will be exposed to the risk of flooding. The Klang
   Valley is well known for its serious problems with flash floods: they
   generally occur four to five times a year and sometimes more often. Two
   to three hours of heavy rain is enough to cause the river in the Klang
   Valley to reach its peak discharge. Flash floods have led to intangible
   psychological impacts on the effected residents. This research will
   discuss the psychological impacts of flash flooding in two residential
   areas with different levels of living community and different housing
   constructions. The first is the properly planned settlement of TTDI Jaya
   and the second is the squatter settlement of Kampung Haji Abdullah
   Hukom. The information discussed here is drawn from interviews with the

Abstract = {{Flash floods are the main natural hazard in many mountain areas due to
   the high discharge and transport of sediment occurring in a few hours or
   even minutes. The hydraulic modelling of flash-flood process in ungauged
   mountain basins often requires the combination of different techniques
   to understand the processes and to evaluate the risk.
   This paper reports on results derived from the use of high-detail
   topography obtained with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), classical
   topographical techniques and dendrogeomorphological evidences. These
   evidences can be seen in the impact on trees of rocks and woody debris
   transported during torrential past floods, which gives rise to
   paleostage indicators representing the minimum discharge elevation
   during floods.
   The combined use of topographic data and dendrogeomorphological
   evidences to calibrate hydraulic models allowed us to characterize the
   magnitude of a singular flood event that took place on December 18,
   1997, in the Arroyo Cabrera mountain stream (Gredos mountain range).
   The methodology was implemented on a stream reach (500 m in length)
   featuring a hydraulic jump on stable bedrock, and numerous scarred trees
   on its banks due to past floods. A high-resolution digital elevation
   model (DEM) based on more than 4 million points was taken with a TLS,
   with an average error of 5mm. Stream cross-sections and morphometrical
   measurements of trees were subsequently collected with Total Station and
   classical topographical techniques in order to calibrate the model. In
   addition, paleostage indicators (PSIs) located on trees were dated using
   dendrogeomorphological methods.
   A 2D numerical flood model, based on a finite differences approach, was
   performed to estimate the peak discharge of the flood. PSIs were used as
   input to the hydraulic model in order to calibrate it. The methodology
   developed provides useful information to reconstruct the magnitude of
   the flood, such as mapping the flooded area on the DEM; the water depth,
   or the pattern of the flow speed. The knowledge of the advantages and
   disadvantages derived from combining the techniques used in this work
   brings useful information for the elaboration of future flash flood
   hazard maps in ungauged mountain catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Possible future violent events in the active hydrothermal, magmatic, and
   tectonic system of Yellowstone National Park pose potential hazards to
   park visitors and infrastructure. Most of the national park and vicinity
   are sparsely populated, but significant numbers of people as well as
   park resources could nevertheless be at risk from these hazards.
   Depending on the nature and magnitude of a particular hazardous event
   and the particular time and season when it might occur, 70,000 to more
   than 100,000 persons could be affected; the most violent events could
   affect a broader region or even continent-wide areas. This assessment of
   such hazards is presented both as a guide for future activities of the
   Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) and to aid appropriate response
   planning by the National Park Service and surrounding agencies and
   communities. Although the assessment is presented here in some technical
   detail, this summary is intended to be understandable to non-scientists.
   The principal conclusions also will be made available in other forms,
   more accessible to general readers.
   The Yellowstone Plateau was built by one of Earth's largest young
   volcanic systems, having episodically erupted great volumes of both lava
   and explosively ejected pumiceous ash for more than 2 million years.
   These eruptive materials are products of two compositional types of
   subsurface magma: basaltic magma is relatively fluid and, in this
   setting, generally produces small to moderate volumes of lava in
   relatively brief eruptions; rhyolitic magma is more viscous and either
   can erupt effusively to produce small to large volumes of lava or
   explosively to produce coarse pumice and finer ash. The three largest
   Yellowstone eruptions produced blanketing deposits of rhyolitic ash so
   hot that they welded into sheets of dense rock covering large areas,
   extending beyond the national park. Each of them also produced a rain of
   ash that spread over much of western and central North America and
   beyond; these ash deposits are greater than 2 m thick near their
   eruptive sources and as much as a meter thick in Surrounding areas. Each
   of these three eruptions produced a caldera, or deep crater-like
   depression, tens of kilometers wide, formed by collapse of the ground
   surface into a partly emptied subterranean magma chamber. The latest of
   these three great eruptions formed the Yellowstone caldera. Renewed
   rhyolitic magma influx beneath the Yellowstone caldera in central
   Yellowstone National Park uplifted parts of the caldera floor and
   produced voluminous intracaldera lavas, the youngest of which extruded
   in a series of eruptive episodes about 164,000, 152,000, 114,000,
   102,000, and 72,000 years ago. During the same span of time, generally
   smaller flows of both basalt and rhyolite have erupted in several areas
   outside the Yellowstone caldera: (1) northwest of the caldera, (2) near
   the southern boundary of the park, (3) in the basin of Island Park, west
   of Yellowstone National Park, and (4) especially in the southern part of
   a corridor between Norris Geyser Basin and Mammoth Hot Springs.
   Disruption of the Earth's surface by faulting and regional uplift
   characterize the geologic framework of Yellowstone Plateau volcanism.
   Some of the regional faults that bound the mountain ranges around the
   Yellowstone Plateau are capable of producing large-magnitude (M>7)
   earthquakes. In contrast, faults within the caldera are mainly small,
   produce smaller-magnitude (M 6.8), relatively shallow earthquakes, and
   reflect strains in the Earth's crust associated with magmatic intrusion
   and hydrothermal activity. Swarms of generally small earthquakes
   occurring within localized areas over restricted periods of time
   characterize much of the earthquake activity within and adjacent to the
   Yellowstone caldera. This seismicity is monitored by a network of
   seismographs within and adjacent to the park and is recorded and
   processed nearly in real time at the University of Utah as part of the
   YVO program and archived as a contribution to the U.S. Geological Survey
   (USGS) Advanced National Seismic System database.
   Leveling surveys, satellite-based measurements, and geologic studies of
   former shorelines of Yellowstone Lake all show that the entire area of
   the Yellowstone caldera and a seismically active zone to the northwest
   undergo episodes of ground uplift and subsidence, sometimes encompassing
   the entire caldera and sometimes in more local and complex patterns of
   both uplift and subsidence. Such deformation in the Yellowstone region
   is monitored by YVO mainly through a network of continuously recorded
   Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers recorded at the University of
   Utah. The GPS data are incorporated as part of the National Science
   Foundation's EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory, archived at UNAVCO
   and available through the YVO website
   (http://voIcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/index.html).
   The active hydrothermal system of Yellowstone National Park is one of
   the largest on Earth. Although accidents involving hot water injure
   Yellowstone visitors from time to time, conformance with normal Park
   Service procedures and regulations would ordinarily be sufficient to
   prevent most of them. By contrast, a commonly recurring, more acute
   hazard at Yellowstone is the explosive ejection of steam, water, and
   rock with no associated volcanism. These hydrothermal explosions are
   caused by hot subsurface waters that flash to steam, breaking the
   overlying rocks that confine them and ejecting the debris to form a
   crater. It is generally not clear just what triggers these events, but
   possible triggers include strong local earthquakes, seasonal or
   long-term declines in ground water levels, and changes in the
   underground distribution of heat. Many hydrothermal explosions have few
   if any premonitory indications.
   At least 26 hydrothermal explosions have been documented in the 126-year
   historic record of the national park, and others undoubtedly escaped
   observation. Since the Yellowstone Plateau was last glaciated, ending
   about 16,000 years ago, at least 18 large hydrothermal explosions have
   formed craters wider than 100 m. Conservatively, at least one
   rock-hurling explosion every two years is estimated to occur at
   Yellowstone, but because most of these events are small and usually
   Occur when few visitors are present, the likelihood of harm to park
   visitors is relatively small. The average recurrence of an explosion
   that could cause personal injury is probably between 10 and 100 years.
   Average recurrence time of an explosion large enough to produce a
   100-m-diameter crater is probably about 200 years, but such an event
   could expel rocks and other hot debris more than 2 km from the explosion
   site. Most hydrothermal-explosion craters at Yellowstone are in the
   Firehole River geyser basins, beneath or around Yellowstone Lake, and in
   the southern part of the Norris- Mammoth Corridor.
   In addition to hydrothermal explosions, toxic gases-mainly carbon
   dioxide and hydro-en sulfide-pose hazards. Concentrations of these gases
   in the atmosphere are generally low at Yellowstone, but they can build
   Lip in confined areas such as valleys, caves, and tunnels, especially
   during windless conditions. Most areas with toxic-gas hazards can be
   kept off-limits to people, but gas emissions should continue to be
   monitored.
   No volcanic eruption has Occurred in Yellowstone National Park or
   vicinity in the last 70,000 years or more. Nevertheless, several types
   of volcanic eruption hazards are possible in the future.
   Basaltic lavas have erupted around the margins of the Yellowstone
   Plateau volcanic field throughout its evolution. These relatively
   low-viscosity lavas generally erupt rapidly, most eruptions lasting no
   more than a few weeks to a few months though the largest flow fields may
   accumulate in multiple eruptions lasting months to years. The average
   period between basaltic eruptions in the Yellowstone region since
   formation of the Yellowstone caldera has been about 16,000 years. The
   most likely location of a future basaltic eruption is within the basin
   of Island Park, west of Yellowstone, but basalts could erupt anywhere in
   a 40-km-wide band around the caldera. Future basaltic eruptions could
   cover several square kilometers with lava up to tens of meters thick.
   Basaltic ash and cinders also might blanket hundreds of square
   kilometers to depths of a few meters to a few centimeters, and if a vent
   emerged beneath water or saturated ground, more explosive eruptions
   could cause significant destruction, such as blasting down trees or
   structures.
   Large rhyolitic lava flows, many having volumes greater than 10 km(3),
   have erupted within the Yellowstone caldera during the past 170,000
   years. Initially these larger eruptions were preceded by explosively
   ejected pumice and ash. In a similar future eruption, ejecta could bury
   broad areas, locally to many meters. Subsequent lava extrusion could
   last for years, covering areas as great as 350-400 km2 to thicknesses of
   tens or hundreds of meters and volumes of 5 to more than 50 km3. Because
   such voluminous rhyolitic lava eruptions have not been observed anywhere
   in historical time, it is uncertain how long such an event might
   continue; extrusion might be orders of magnitude faster than for smaller
   flows. The probability of a future large intracaldera rhyolitic eruption
   is difficult to estimate. Available data suggest a highly episodic
   behavior of past eruptions of this sort, periods of a few thousand years
   characterized by numerous eruptions being separated by longer intervals
   of about 12,000 to 38,000 years without eruption. One statistical
   measure of eruption probabilities based on this episodic behavior
   suggests an average recurrence of 20,000 years. The fact that no such
   eruption has occurred for more than 70,000 years may mean that
   insufficient eruptible magma remains beneath the Yellowstone caldera to
   produce another largevolume lava flow.
   Small rhyolitic lava flows postdating the Yellowstone caldera have
   erupted mainly north of the caldera, but one such flow also lies near
   the South Entrance to the park. Two distinct types of primary hazards
   might be associated with small rhyolitic eruptions at Yellowstone. Just
   as for larger rhyolitic lava eruptions, initial venting almost certainly
   would explosively eject rhyolitic pumice; the coarser fragments would
   fall back close to the vent, but finer pumiceous ash would enter the
   atmosphere and fall downwind for many kilometers. Structures, power
   lines, etc. could be damaged by ash loading, especially if eruption were
   accompanied by heavy rain. The initial explosive eruptions could last a
   few hours to several weeks and be followed by viscous extrusion of
   rhyolitic lava, covering several square kilometers to tens of meters
   thick; lava could continue to extrude for many months or even years.
   Viscous rhyolitic lava would advance much more slowly than a basaltic
   flow; most affected facilities could be safely evacuated and perhaps
   relocated. The average recurrence period of small extracaldera rhyolitic
   eruptions in the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field is about 50,000
   years.
   In addition to the primary hazards posed by any future eruption of
   basalt or a small or large rhyolitic lava eruption, important possible
   secondary consequences include wildland fires, debris flows, and floods
   triggered by the displacement of surface drainages by lava.
   Systematic seismic, deformation, and hydrothermal monitoring by YVO is
   likely to provide indicators of any impending volcanic eruptive activity
   in Yellowstone National Park. Premonitory events detected by such
   monitoring might include multiple shallow earthquake swarms of
   increasing frequency and intensity, the ground vibrations called
   volcanic tremor, localized uplift of the surface, ground cracks, and
   anomalous gas emissions.
   Of all the possible hazards from a future volcanic eruption in the
   Yellowstone region, by far the least likely would be another explosive
   caldera-forming eruption of great volumes of rhyolitic ash. Abundant
   evidence indicates that hot magma continues to exist beneath
   Yellowstone, but it is uncertain how much of it remains liquid, how well
   the liquid is interconnected, and thus how much remains eruptible. Any
   eruption of sufficient volume to form a new caldera probably would occur
   only from within the present Yellowstone caldera, and the history of
   postcaldera rhyolitic eruptions strongly suggests that the subcaldera
   magma chamber is now a largely crystallized mush. The probability of
   another major caldera-forming Yellowstone eruption, in the absence of
   strong premonitory indications of major magmatic intrusion and degassing
   beneath a large area of the caldera, can be considered to be below the
   threshold of useful calculation.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas lie inside nature systems, in river basins and nearby
   coastal zones. The development of and threat to an urban area is
   dependant upon processes and events occurring in surrounding territory.
   This paper looks at two towns that are located inside river basins. In
   the first case, the urban territory is under threat of floods
   originating upstream. In the second case, flash floods occur due to
   local upstream storms. Protection and mitigation strategies for water
   floods were simulated using the Virtual Nature System (VNS). The VNS
   uses models of urban and surrounding areas and, when used in combination
   with continual inflows from 2D remote sensing data and the Moving
   Digital Earth (MDE) technology, provides quick continual reforming of
   the 2D information and applies it to processes in natural systems. It
   offers real-time recognition of location and intensity of impending
   disasters such as floods, debris-flows, spreading of pollution, and
   other hazardous events that affect the urban environment. The VNS and
   MDE support the GeoInformatics processes and spatial-temporal
   GeoDynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Sensor networks have been deployed for a range of rural and
   environmental applications. Well-regarded for the volume and range of
   data which can be obtained, wireless sensor network applications capable
   of using the data gathered have not been fully realized, particularly in
   urban settings. Street CORNERS is a wireless sensor network application
   which supports the contextual presentation of data gathered from an
   urban setting. The Street CORNERS application offers real-time data
   display, and provides support for predictive algorithms suitable for
   anticipating, detecting, and defending urban communities, among others,
   from environmental threats such as declining air quality and urban flash
   floods. Street CORNERS is presented in two parts. The network design and
   deployment is outlined, followed by a discussion of the design of the
   network application, which is involved in data preprocessing and the
   contextual presentation of the data gathered for trend identification.}},

Abstract = {{One of the accepted scenarios of climate change is that we will
   experience more deluges, especially in areas that are subject to severe
   storms. Failure to prepare for, and adequately warn residents about,
   such rain events was evident in storm deluges in 2008/2009 in South-East
   Queensland and mega floods in northern Queensland which spread to cover
   over 70\% of the state with continued heavy rainfalls. The lack of
   adequate infrastructure to mitigate the effects of the precipitation
   reminds us how important it is to study previous events and to learn
   from them. One of the neglected areas of flash flooding and mega floods
   is that of backbuilding. South-East Queensland has experienced flood
   events of differing magnitudes during many of the summer seasons in the
   past three decades, with the 1974 flood being the most significant. At
   the time of writing this chapter, because of the severe drought in
   Australia in recent years, no further opportunities had arisen to update
   the information on flooding realities, although SEQ Water has
   comparatively recently completed a \$70 million Wivenhoe Dam upgrade
   project which involved the construction of a 165-meter wide spillway and
   related works to mitigate a 1 in 100,000-year flood scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disasters like Glacier Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) severely
   disrupt livelihoods, infrastructures and community development whether
   they occur at the large or medium scale. The latest GLOF occurred in the
   head reach of Madi River, a main tributary of Gandaki River. From 1954
   to 2002, floods have affected over a million people in Nepal. The
   episode of Kawache Glacier Lake Outburst Flood that occurred on 15
   August 2003 in the upper reach of Madi River watershed caused a
   disastrous flash flood in the Madi River.
   This paper investigates the basic cause of the GLOF linked with an
   important meteorological parameter i.e. temperature. Analysis of
   temperature within the Madi River watershed indicates that there is
   slight increasing trend in temperature which may be one of the causes
   that triggered such disasters. The more or less steady rising trend of
   temperature has been the main cause of GLOF in the past and present so
   it is necessary to do complete detailed and multi-disciplinary
   investigations of the total environment of the lakes, glaciers and
   associated factors in that surround it.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid increase in using, mobile communication networks for
   transmitting confidential data and conducting commercial transactions
   such as mobile e-commerce is creating large demands in designing secure
   mobile business systems. However, the mobile devices and mobile
   communication network have some weakness. It call cause some problems
   using traditional VPN technologies in mobile computing environments
   immediately. Currently, mobile users' authentication in IKE is being
   done using certificates or PSK with aggressive mode commonly. They have
   serious security related issues (for PSK with aggressive mode) and need
   high deployment and maintain cost (for certificates). in this paper. we
   propose a new approach that is based on PSK where the IKE negotiation
   phase is modified for using in mobile computing environments. The
   modified IKE. consists of four messages, and the responder doesn't need
   to store any state while receiving message 1. It uses strong cookies and
   pre-calculated DHpp stack, etc technologies to counter IP flooding
   attacks and Man-in-the-Middle DoS attacks, because it does not require
   the responder to perform heavy computations before the initiator has
   authenticated itself. Otherwise, for one mobile user, it has a group of
   PSKs to be random selected and the initiator and responder exchange
   identity into and agree oil PSK with flash (PSK-ID|IDr) or Hash
   (PSK-ID|IDr) info. Therefore, it provides the initiator and responder's
   identity protection and prevention of passive dictionary based attacks
   on pre-shared keys.}},

Abstract = {{Between the end of March and the first half of April 2007 the Ebro, the

   always within the context of flooding risk management in such a varied
   and altered environment as the Ebro Basin. The originality of this flood
   lies in the three different discharge maxima corresponding to the three

Abstract = {{The threat of Denial of Service flooding attacks in the Internet is
   rapidly increasing. Especially the use of techniques that allow
   attackers to hide their attack traffic. raises concerns: attack
   distribution and rotation in botnets to obfuscate senders, low-rate
   bandwidth attacks, and attacks that mimic realistic patterns such as
   flash crowds. The defense against such attacks is limited due to a
   deadlock: the attacks must. be stopped inside the network, but the
   network is unable to distinguish legitimate and unsolicited traffic. In
   contrast, end systems may distinguish legitimate users from bots, but
   are unable to stop the attacks inside the network. This paper advocates
   for a joint end system-network defense to address such attacks in the
   future. Edge-based Capabilities (EC) is a novel framework that combines
   end-to-end authentication with network-based control. Applications
   authenticate legitimate senders and issue capabilities to tag their
   packets, and the network filters out untagged packets. This paper
   describes the mechanisms that make EC a secure, efficient, and scalable
   solution. Moreover, we argue that EC is an attractive solution because
   it can be incrementally deployed and because it provides the right
   incentives to users, servers, and ISPs.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution denial-of-service (DDoS) constitutes one of the major
   threats and among the hardest security problems in today's Internet.
   However, DDoS detection techniques, such as signature-based detection,
   anomaly-based detection, and wavelet-based signal analysis, face the
   considerable challenge of determining network-based flooding attacks
   from sudden increases in legitimate activity or flash events. In this
   paper, we study the basic characteristic of network traffic, and propose
   a method for meeting the challenge. By taking full advantage of known
   traffic in normal state, we design a detection algorithm for dealing
   with DDoS attacks. We have carried out experiments with actual data to
   evaluate the algorithm. The results show that it can recognize DDoS
   attacks.}},

Abstract = {{After long and intense rains in a mountainous region, large quantities
   of water flow in the torrents. For some reason, this flow can be
   obstructed by cross-linked branches and debris (natural dam). When the
   hydrostatic pressure exerted by the fluid exceeds a given yield value,
   the dam collapses and the fluid is released inside and outside the
   torrent bed, as well. Such scenario which is known as a dam-break flow
   can describe the initiation of certain geological flows, (debris flows,
   mudflows, etc.). As for any gravity current, the flow description
   depends on the time scale. Immediately after the dam collapse, the
   inertial forces are the dominant ones and this configuration can model a
   flah flood. Flash floods develop at time and space scales that
   conventional observation systems are not able to monitor, so reliable
   modelling remains a crucial step. At larger time scale, a viscous regime
   takes place where the viscous forces become the dominant ones and this
   configuration can model a classical debris flow. Debris floods develop
   in a long domain, i.e. a domain of space that is much longer than it is
   wide. They generally erode their bed and transport much energy and can
   move rocks and boulders upon very long distances. Both, the flash floods
   and the debris floods constitute dangerous phenomena for public safety
   and quality of life. The originality of the present approach is to
   consider these two flood waves as special cases of a single global model
   of a dam-break flow of a muddy fluid, depending on the time scale. The
   study was experimental, analytical and numerical, as well. The
   experimental study consisted in designing model fluids to be used in the
   laboratory experiments, characterizing these synthetic muds and
   monitoring the corresponding dam-break flows in the laboratory. While
   the theoretical study consisted in stating the equations of motion
   governing the different flows studied, and solving them in their non
   dimensional form, both analytically and numerically.}},

Abstract = {{In the Chili River Basin (Peru), currently impacts of mining on water
   quality and quantity are minor due to good practices, but the river is
   polluted by untreated sewage from Arequipa city. The Lake Poopo and Urn
   Urn basin (Bolivia) is heavily contaminated by abandoned and active
   mining operations ranging from informal and cooperative miners to
   international mining companies. Additionally, the toxic metal-bearing
   host rocks cause pollution of geogenic origin. In the Elqui River Basin
   (Chile), the major concerns relate to conflicts about water quantities
   used by mining and agriculture, respectively, as well as contamination
   risks due to flash floods of abandoned tailing deposits in El Nino

   revolution in hydrologic-hydraulic modeling through the fast processing
   of remote sensing techniques and their results distribution,

Abstract = {{Floods over the main-stream basin of the Songhua River in NE China are
   characterized by 24 and 3 similar to 4 year periods, and by 4 phases:
   1911-1914, 1930-1940, 1954-1958 and 1984-1998. The flooding frequency is
   increased remarkably as time goes on. The paper is devoted to the direct
   cause of the flooding due to July similar to August flash rainfall in
   the Nen River valley and the Second Songhua-Gelin River catchment area,
   for which the 500 hPa circulation background is studied, that is, the
   July similar to August anomalous pattern of the Tibetan plateau to
   Alaska exhibits a ``+-+-{''} structure, with a blocking high over the
   Okhotsk Sea and NE China under the control of a trough. In the year of
   flooding the Aleutian low deepens in the spring, extending westward and
   the Ural high is established and moves east. The 1998 deluge over the
   Song-Nen Plain was related broadly to the circulation pattern anomaly
   and excessive precipitation except that much-more-than-record rainfall
   occurred in June and August over the Nen River basin.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional methods for the estimation of flood frequency are generally
   based on the statistical analysis of data series resulting from the
   measurement of water levels at specific locations, which are translated
   into discharges (m(3)/s) using standard stage/discharge relationships.
   Subsequently, these gauged flows are used to identify the largest flood
   event experienced by a river or catchment, and to produce growth curves
   used in the estimation of the return periods of specific flood events,
   as well as in the calculation of discharges for specific required design
   events (e.g. return period 1 in 100 year). In areas where gauging data
   records are scarce, and/or the data series are short or interrupted,
   geomorphological interpretation of the physical environment, dating of
   fluvial deposits and flooding episodes and hydraulic reconstruction of
   past flood events can be used as complementary tools aiding conventional
   hydrological and flood frequency analysis methods. This paper will
   discuss the undertaking of this approach in the Guadalope Catchment in
   northeast Spain. It will examine the findings in relation to the
   inadequate design of existing structures such as dams, spillways, canals
   and reservoirs, and will also look at the potential risks associated
   with flooding at present.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed networks of short-range radars offer the potential to
   observe winds and rainfall at high spatial resolution in volumes of the
   troposphere that are unobserved by today's long-range weather radars.
   One class of potential distributed radar network designs includes
   Off-the-Grid (OTG) weather radar networks. These are short-range radar
   nodes designed to be deployed as part of an ad-hoc network and to limit
   their reliance on existing infrastructure. Independence of the wired
   infrastructure (power or communications) would allow OTG networks to be
   deployed in specific regions where sensing needs are greatest, such as
   mountain valleys prone to flash-flooding, geographic regions where the
   infrastructure is susceptible to failure, and underdeveloped regions
   lacking urban infrastructure. This paper will present a system model and
   simulation framework for the design of OTG networks. The model estimates
   the energy requirements of the three major system functions, sensing,
   communicating and computing, as well as power generated from the solar
   panel. The simulation will be used to develop an energy cost function to
   be used in control decisions.}},

Abstract = {{We identify important research, development and technology transfer
   issues associated with improving operational forecast and management of
   natural floods and flash floods to mitigate their disastrous impacts.
   These issues are physical and social science issues as well as
   institutional issues pertaining to the coordination of researchers,
   forecasters and end-users toward improving effectiveness of the
   hydrologic enterprise of flood damage mitigation and death toll
   reduction. A case study of integrated end-to-end climate-hydrology-water
   resources management in an operational environment, and another of flash
   flood prediction over large regions with very high resolution serve to
   highlight these issues. Transition from deterministic to probabilistic
   forecasting is advanced as necessary for improving forecast generation
   and use. In addition, the concept of demonstration testbeds with
   participation of researchers, forecasters and end-users is advanced as a
   viable solution to the development of end-to-end forecast-decision
   systems for mitigating flood damage and reducing disaster death tolls.}},

Abstract = {{Students at Desert View Elementary School in Sunland Park, New Mexico
   have been involved in the GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to
   Benefit the Environment) Fermilab Engaged Learning Program, and New
   Mexico Service Learning Program for several years. Land Cover change,
   especially those changes affecting watersheds, is part of GLOBE's
   agenda. During an extreme precipitation event, August 1, 2006, the
   Sunland Park, New Mexico, Cuidad Juarez, Mexico and El Paso, Texas
   region experienced severe flooding as a result of torrential rains, and
   subsequent failure of an inadequately engineered municipal drainage
   system. A record 187mm (7.5 in.) reportedly fell in three hours. In an
   effort to demonstrate to his students why this storm event created such
   havoc in the region, Albert Ortiz, a teacher at Desert View, decided to
   have his students use satellite imagery to investigate the problem. The
   students were asked to study the images to determine what effect land
   development, particularly in areas where major arroyos drain the
   mountain slopes, added to the flooding. Since no post flood images could
   be obtained the students were taken on a field trip to selected areas
   with copies of these images to analyze changes that had taken place as a
   result of flash flooding. The students first measured width of several
   major arroyos and compared it with what they saw on the pre-flood image.
   They found them to be at least four times wider. They determined the
   cross-sectional area of selected arroyos and estimated the amount of
   discharge coming from them during peak flow. In the field they elected
   to follow, and take measurements in the main arroyo leading from
   Franklin Mountain State Park, to where it entered the Rio Grande River.
   This park is located on the western flank of the mountain. As the
   students followed the arroyo out of the park down to where it passed
   under a bridge at Trans-Mountain Road and 1-10, about 9 km away, they
   could see on the satellite image that several other arroyos converged
   with the one they were following. They again measured the arroyo at that
   location. After passing under the Interstate bridge, the drainage water
   from these arroyos is diverted into a channel that makes a 45 degree
   angle from a direct path to the river. The channel's size and angle was
   completely inadequate to handle the volume of water flowing into it as a
   result of the heavy rain. A small housing development located next to
   the channel at Mowad St. was engulfed by mud and flood water from the
   overflowing channel and the houses were declared completely
   uninhabitable and condemned. The students visited the Mowad St.
   development where they saw condemned houses and piles of rubble where
   other houses had been bulldozed. They discussed how much of the
   destruction could have been prevented. By using satellite images, and
   comparing them with what they investigated on their field trip, the
   students were able to see how much change had taken place in their
   watershed, both from natural causes and by residential and industrial
   development on the mountain slopes. They also learned how technology can
   be used to address real life problems such as the one that overtook the
   Mowad St. subdivision.}},

Abstract = {{In all eight out of the ten countries constituting Southern Africa
   region most people live in rural areas and depend on subsistence
   agriculture for their livelihoods. In the region land degradation occurs
   mostly from soil erosion, chemical degradation (loss of nutrients,
   depletion of organic matter and acidification) and biological depletion.
   Other factors which contribute to land degradation in the region include
   compaction from overgrazing of rangelands, uncontrolled burning and
   improper cultivation of steep slopes, alternating flooding and crusting,
   salinization and pollution which all combine to cause degeneration of
   the fragile ecosystems covering large expanses of the region. Landscapes
   devoid of vegetative cover deeply incised by gullies that are difficult
   to reclaim, characterize large land expanses in the region classified as
   drylands. The portions classified as sub-humid or humid (highlands and
   wetlands) are prone to rapid soil loss from flash floods or periodic
   flooding. With a cycle of 2-3 and sometimes 5-6 years, droughts that
   have occurred in the region for over a century, worsen the land
   degradation problem making land management a formidable task
   particularly during the critical moisture deficient periods. Differing
   land tenure systems combined with high poverty and low literacy levels
   common among the rural population complicate land management process.
   Low technological capacity, poor governance, poorly conceived management
   policies and their implementation further complicate land management
   issues. Technology development, technology transfer and low adoption
   rates further exacerbate the situation. Pressure on the land and
   competition for land is of main concern throughout the region.
   Governments in the region as well as private organizations (including
   the numerous NGOs operating in the region), some communities and
   individuals (including researchers and academicians) have all identified
   the need to conserve land and reverse degradation to restore its
   productivity and improve the quality of life for those who depend on it
   for their livelihoods. The chapter examines the nature and causes of
   land degradation in the region, linking it to population
   characteristics, land ownership, low technological capacity, poverty,
   poor governance, low literacy and inappropriate land management
   practices. The chapter points out that numerous interventions targeted
   at reducing poverty and improvement in land resource management have not
   achieved their targets due to lack of coordination, rigidity and
   imposition which culminated in failure of the interveners to recognize
   and incorporate indigenous knowledge and peoples' preferences and/or
   indigenous age-old land management strategies. Linkages to trade and
   unequal market access that encourages poverty and unwise use of the land
   resources are discussed. Adopting ``people centered{''} interventions is
   recommended together with smart partnerships between the participating
   partners both from the north and those from the south. Solutions will
   largely depend on willingness to change and sharing information that
   will guide appropriate regional action. The region faces an enormous
   challenge part of which is to come up with viable solutions that will
   reverse the degradation of land and manage it sustainably.}},

Abstract = {{After severe flash floods that caused many fatalities a few years ago in
   the Mediterranean regions of France, the French government decided to
   help local authorities to reduce flood risk. Through the example of
   small basins in southern France, this paper shows the principles and the
   practises involved in mitigating flood risk. The flood risk management
   plans, established by river basin authorities, are subsidized both by
   the central government and by local authorities. They illustrate the
   progressive change of philosophy in flood management policy. The
   principles of flood risk management have changed through history from
   structural measures (dikes, embankments, dams) to non-structural methods
   (e.g., land-use planning, preparedness measures, reduction of
   vulnerability, early-warning systems, human collective memory and public
   awareness). The flood risk management policies are thus politically and
   technically integrated. This paper points out some of the reasons that
   can explain the success or the failure of flood risk reduction in a
   river basin. It shows how partisan politics can be an obstacle to the
   implementation of such plans. The last challenge is to evaluate the
   positive and negative effects of the flood-mitigation policies. This
   work finishes by proposing some indicators to evaluate the real effects
   of flood reduction.}},

   distinguish the normal flash crowds from the anomalous traffic of
   distributed denial of service attacks in large-scale Web site. This
   paper used hidden semi-Markov model to categorize the Web pages in an
   unsupervised manner. A new parameter re-estimation algorithm based on
   segmental K-means algorithm was derived for the model which was used to
   implement the application-layer distributed denial of service attacks
   detection for large-scale Web server. Likelihood of observation sequence
   on user browsing behaviors fitting to the model was used as a measure of
   user's normality. Finally, an experiment was conducted to validate our
   model and algorithm, which was based on a set of data colleted from a
   real traffic data of a heavily-accessed Web server and an emulated
   distributed denial of service attack that launches flooding of HTTP
   requests to the Web site.}},

Abstract = {{El Shalateen-Halayeb triangle is a promising district for tourism and
   agricultural development. Pre-Miocene rocks (fractured basement and
   Nubia sandstone) represent the main water-bearing formations in the
   investigated area. Rainfall and occasionally flash floods represent the
   main sources of recharge. Groundwater occurrence and movement in
   basement aquifer is mainly controlled by the Structural elements, where
   interaction between fractures and intrusive dykes reflect a good
   environment for groundwater entrapment. In fractured basement aquifer,
   the transmissivity ranges from 2.75 m(2)/day to 784 m(2)/day. Such wide
   variation Could be attributed to the lateral facies changes as well as
   the impact of the complicated structural setting. Nubia sandstone is
   detected as a water-bearing in Abraq, Abu Saafa and EL Dif localities,
   its transmissivity varies frorn 2.72 m(2)/day to 72.4 m(2)/day. Poor
   potentiality of aquifers is mainly due to high channel gradient, which
   gives no chance for groundwater replenishment. Regionally, the direction
   of groundwater flow is mainly restricted by the variable hydraulic
   gradients from locality to another.
   Twenty-three groundwater samples were collected and chemically analysed.
   Groundwater salinity of basement aquifer varies from 438 mg/l to 10409
   mg/l, reflecting a wide variation in groundwater quality from fresh to
   saline. The groundwater quality of Nubia sandstone aquifer varies from
   fresh to brackish, where the salinity ranges from 459 mg/l to 1292 mg/l.
   In basement aquifer, the type Cl-Na is dominant, while in Nubia
   sandstone aquifer, HCO3-Na and Cl-Na water types are recognized. In
   basement aquifer, the groundwater is mostly characterized by permanent
   hardness (except Nos. 1, 6 \& 13 have a perfect temperary hardness). In
   Nubia sandstone aquifer, the groundwater is mainly characterized by
   temporary hardness. In basement groundwater, Cl is the most correlated
   anion with salinity (R-2 = 0.9615), and Na is the most correlated cation
   with salinity (R-2=0.9153). In Nubia sandstone groundwater, SO4 is the
   most correlated anion with salinity (W = 0.7573) and Na is the most
   correlated cation with salinity (R-2 = 0.8578). Groundwater quality was
   evaluated for different uses and some recommendations were given.}},

Abstract = {{The number of people inhabiting our globe is constantly increasing. At
   the same time the amount of people living in the cities is growing very
   fast. This way in many countries the population of the cities amounts to
   80\% of the total country's population. Floods in urban areas are more
   and more frequent. These floods cause considerable economic and social
   losses mainly because of developed and expensive city infrastructure.
   This infrastructure goes now very often underground, which is very flood
   prone in case of inundation of the city. In urban areas measures and
   solutions for flood mitigation are primarily of engineering character.
   However, very often it is difficult to find advantageous technical
   solutions, because existing city infrastructure restricts the
   introduction of appropriate new constructions. Another important factor
   in urban areas is considerable speed of floods, which requires earlier,
   good planning of solutions in case of inundation.
   Flash flood in Gdansk in 2001 can be considered as an example of local
   case. Gdansk the Polish old city situated at the mouth of the Vistula
   River (1047 kin long) is most flood prone agglomeration in Poland. There
   are three possible flood directions. First is from the moraine hills, in
   case of intensive precipitation, second direction is from the Gulf of
   Gdansk in case of storm surges and the third is from the main Vistula
   channel in case of very high discharge.
   The paper presents the description of floods in the area of Gdansk
   during past centuries. They were caused mainly by ice jams which formed
   along final section of Vistula River of very complicated layout. In July
   2001 a severe flash flood, coming from the moraine hills invaded Gdansk
   causing considerable economic and social losses. It was caused by very
   high and intensive rainfall. One of the main objects in this flood was
   an artificial Radunia Channel, constructed in the XI V century. The main
   aim of this Channel was the supply of water to the city of Gdansk. In
   the paper the analysis of this flood is presented. Detailed measurements
   of all water courses, hydrological and hydraulic analysis were carried
   out. I D unsteady flow model of the Gdansk Water Node was developed.
   Calculations were carried out to find the best technical solutions to
   mitigate consequences of a similar flood in the future. It was proposed
   to construct 18 small retention reservoirs in the catchment of Radunia
   Channel, 4 additional control discharge structures from Radunia Channel
   and in addition 2 flood polders. The network of measuring stations was
   also proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel metal hydride batteries bring some unique values to stationary
   applications - high energy and power densities, cycle life, quick charge
   capability and safety, to name a few. Since the late 80's, small
   cylindrical nickel metal hydride batteries have been widely used in
   portable applications requiring high rate discharge and rapid recharge,
   for example, camera flash and power tools. Recently, large prismatic
   nickel metal hydride batteries have become the technology of choice in
   hybrid electric vehicles due to their good cycle life, wide temperature
   range of operation and high rate capability. Additionally, these
   batteries have been tested and installed in large stationary
   applications due to their unique values. In one of those applications, a
   flooded lead acid battery system, used to back up 560kW, was replaced
   with nickel metal hydride battery system to provide the same 15 minutes
   of back up time. A case study with this large nickel metal hydride
   battery installation will be presented in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Building major infrastructure projects in adverse social and climatic
   conditions is never easy. The Ma'rib irrigation project In Yemen is a
   classic case, with the 65 pound million scheme taking over 30 years to
   complete. Civil unrest, tribal feuds, flash floods and windblown sand
   all played their part in its delay, but work is finally scheduled to be
   completed next year. A total of 74 km(2), including nearly 50 km(2) Of
   former desert, will soon be irrigated by the country's largest dam,
   enabling the land to be farmed again-as it was in ancient times. This
   paper describes the design and prolonged construction of this
   technologically straightforward yet hugely challenging and beneficial
   civil engineering project.}},

Abstract = {{Gandak fan, is a large lobate feature trending in NW-SE direction,
   restricted between the fluvial regimes of Little Gandak in the west and
   Burhi Gandak in the cast, in parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh and north
   Bihar. It is characterised by distinct geomorphology, manifested by
   clusters of tals, palaeochannels, oxbow lakes and spill over channels
   left out by a past history of river migration and flash floods of Gandak
   and its predecessors. The terrain is characterised by wide spread drapes
   of newer alluvium sediments locally known as Bhat Alluvium forming a
   calcareous, fine sandy to silty soil. Gramilometric properties of the
   sand sequence associated with this unit indicate dominance of very fine
   grained sand with median value of 3.0 phi. The clay mineral study of
   this soil unit indicates preponderance of calcite mineral (30\%) besides
   illite, chlorite and muscovite.
   Based on the analysis and synthesis of data, an attempt has been made to
   interpret the morphology of Gandak fan and the genesis of widespread
   occurrences of Bhat Alluvium of this region. The model envisaged for the
   formation of the fan dwells on possible cataclasmic neotectonic events
   related to Gandak Tear and other structures in the vicinity. The
   neotectonic event triggered widespread river migration/avulsion and
   cascades of mud flows released from breach and spill over of some large
   lacustrine bodies formed earlier by damming of the river course in the
   Jhawani Valley in upstream of Gandak catchment area in Nepal. In
   addition, the geological and geomorphological set up of Gandak Fan has
   also relevance to environmental scenario of the area especially to the
   perpetual floods in large tracts of north Bihar.
   It is also surmised that the cascades of mudflows related in the
   formation of fan and rampant floods in the area might be the causative
   factors for burial of many important temples and monasteries of Buddhist
   period, such as Kushinagar, Vaishali, Lauria, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy flash floods have recently occurred in Mediterranean South of

   not the same when considering upstream or downstream areas of the
   watershed river. A review of both the forecasting strategies and the

   of the cities in Iran have developed in such environments, and are

   and the deficiency of urban planning in the last four decades. The
   present study aims at analyzing the urbanization effect on natural
   drainage patterns and their immediate result, namely the increase of
   vulnerability of the metropolitan city of Mashhad. Mashhad, as the
   second religious metropolis of the world, and second metropolis of Iran
   has an annual 12 million pilgrims, and 3 million population. The results
   of this study indicate that the rapid growth of the city from 1966 to
   2002 has had excessive destructive effects on the catchments area, and
   has caused the decrease of impervious surfaces, and the increase peak

Abstract = {{Due to these uncertainties (data uncertainty, parameter uncertunty, and
   model uncertainty) associate with the modeling processes, it turns to
   more difficult to accomplish a well-validated model through a
   conventional approach. Particularly, the models of hydraulic relevant
   systems with hundreds of thousands of nodes have become increasingly
   common to undertake more realistic simulation. These models create heavy
   demands on computing time and computer capacity. As a result, a
   significant delay usually exists between the required real response-time
   and the actual computational-time. The management real response-time is
   an essential factor to justify, a timely decision-making. For example,
   dealing with an input of a rapid change condition of a hydrologic avow
   such as a flash flood into a simulation system has become a challenge
   task. In this paper, ANNs is used to integrate with numerical model for
   two ways. For the neuro-numetical approach, ANNs is used to extract the
   existing patterns from a well-validated numerical model and to generate
   an ``input-outpit{''} simulator. Two demonstration examples -
   hydrodynamic simulation for a tidal wetland and sediment transport
   simulation, are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Protection of Mobile IP networks from Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, a
   serious security threat in today's Internet, is a one major step toward
   making this paradigm a reality. The paper proposes a method to detect
   DoS attacks, issued from mobile users, in the vicinity of flooding
   sources and in early stages before they cripple the targeted system. The
   fundamental challenge in attack detection consists in distinguishing
   between simple flash events and DoS attacks so as not to deprive
   innocent users from having legitimate accesses. In the proposed
   mechanism, this distinction is based on the fact that legitimate TCP
   flows obey the congestion control protocol, whereas misbehaving sources
   remain unresponsive. Suspicious flows are sent a test feedback and are
   required to decrease their sending rates. Legitimacy of such flows is
   decided based on their responsiveness. The scheme performance is
   evaluated through a set of simulations and encouraging results are
   obtained: short detection latency and high detection accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Flood research is impeded from the fact that many hydrological basins
   are poorly gauged or ungauged due to the inadequacy of the existing
   measurement meteo/hydro-networks. Giofyros basin on the central-north
   part of the island of Crete is considered as a poorly gauged basin and
   is subject to flash flood events one of which, the 1994 flood, is the
   study of the present paper. A method for estimating the flood hydrograph
   and volume in a poorly gauged basin with stage gauge failure during the
   flood event but known flood extent at the peak is presented. Data
   available was: a low resolution DTM of the area, hourly precipitation
   data form one station, daily precipitation from two stations, hourly
   water stage from one station that failed during the flood event and a
   recorded flood level of a specific cross section of the 1994 flood
   event. The watershed and hydrographic network topographic
   characteristics was generated using HEC - GeoHMS module. A technique of
   interpolating-extrapolating hourly precipitation data for all gauging
   stations from the combination of hourly and daily data is applied to
   generate the spatio/temporal rainfall distribution. Sensitivity analysis
   of the rainfall - runoff model was performed, which was based on the
   following parameters (a) Curve Number, (b) roughness coefficient (c)
   imperviousness and (d) soil initial abstraction. HEC-RAS is used for
   model calibration was based on the simulation of eight rainfall events
   of medium and high intensities. An index which is the product of the 6
   hrs rainfall intensity times the total precipitation is introduced as a
   criterion for the characterization of the rainfall event and is used in
   the estimation through extrapolation of the flow hydrograph and flood
   volume for the 1994 flood event. In addition the flood peak flow was
   estimated using the Manning's equation and the geometric characteristics
   of a specific cross section. The observed value of the peak flow flood
   level was 5,1 m and the simulated value was 5,36 m, a value only 5\%
   higher, indicating that the model could accurately simulate the flood
   extent within a poorly gauged basin.}},

Abstract = {{One-third of the Earth's surface can currently be classified as and or
   semiarid. This fraction may increase in the future for example due to
   global warming effects. Many and and semiarid regions are particularly
   affected by flash floods, caused mainly by convective storm systems, and
   often resulting in significant damages to property and even loss of
   life. The short duration and the small geographic extent of these events
   make predicting the subsequent floods extremely difficult. To improve
   our predictive capability, we are currently developing a semiarid
   specific model based on the well-established event-based rainfall-runoff
   model KINEROS2, capable of continuously simulating the response of a
   specific basin and driven by high-resolution precipitation measurements.
   This spatially distributed kinematic wave model represents the basin as
   a cascade of planes and channels. The dynamic infiltration algorithm is
   particularly well suited for simulation of semiarid hydrological
   processes. Adjustments to the original model include restructuring the
   code in a modular fashion, adding long-term soil moisture storage and
   evapotranspiration algorithms, and including optimization tools for
   parameter estimation. The project aims towards more accurate, reliable
   and probabilistic flood warnings, for semiarid flash-flood forecasting,
   risk assessment and decision making. This paper outlines the model and
   some associated data processing tools, and represents some initial
   results of applying the model to a small semiarid basin in the
   Southwestern USA.}},

Abstract = {{The city of Naga is a medium sized city on the isle of Luzon in the
   Philippines. It is located in an area that is frequently bit by typhoons
   that cause severe inundations of the city and the surrounding
   agricultural lands. Several types of floods affect the area, sometimes
   in combination: a) riverine floods from the Bicol, the main river in the
   area, b) flash-floods from the torrent Naga, and c) storm surges from
   the sea. In close collaboration with the municipality of Naga, a
   research program was initiated to investigate to what extend
   hydrodynamic modelling can be used as an instrument to: a) assess the
   flood hazard situation in terms of inundation probability and b) to make
   a risk assessment based on the flood hazard and the elements at risk.
   This paper presents the first results of flood inundation modelling. In
   the future the city intends to use these models as simulation tools to
   support decision-making in designing mitigation measures and to assess
   the suitability of potential urban expansion sites.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decades, many urban areas around the world have been
   experiencing a dramatic increase in disaster due to flood. Flood is one
   of the extreme hydrological events which has been a major concern since
   the dawn of human civilization. Especially the flash flood, it can cause
   the greatest number of deaths and the greatest damage in a sudden. The
   impact of flood on people's livelihood may be much longer than the water
   take to recede. The effect of lost and degraded assets can also have
   very much long-term impact on society and ecosystems. It is obvious that
   flood incident has become the limiting factor to economic and social
   development. Therefore, various efforts have been set out for
   establishment of the proper prevention and mitigation to reach
   sustainable level to relief flood stress in such a way that avoid the
   past mistakes and satisfy the widest range of needs and maintain the
   natural ecosystem (Budhakooncharoen, S., 2001). The current situation to
   cope with this type of water related extreme event is diversified into
   four levels, namely disaster preparedness, prevention and mitigation,
   emergency response and disaster recovery. Among promising response
   strategies, the role of forecast and warning system is widely taken into
   consideration in several research studies to contribute to the
   systematic preparedness of urban flood management. This calls for a
   sequence of several steps (Todini, E., 2000), namely establishing an
   effective monitoring to detect all possible formation of storm through
   meteorological conditions and hydrological process which may lead to the
   extreme event. Future river flow condition and water stage are
   forecasted on the place, time, magnitude, areal extension, duration and
   time span of crisis based mathematical modeling including
   meteorological, hydrological and hydraulic models (Bronstert, A., 2002).
   Warning is sent to the appropriate authorities and to the public. The
   population at risk and the authorities responsible for the defense
   responds to the warning. Finally, assistance during and after the
   disaster hit is taken place, eg. provision of food, drinking water,
   shelter and medical care including reconstruction of infrastructure,
   rehabilitation of the environment and of the defense system. The
   challenge lies in the improvement of meteorological model to assess in
   detail the location and the magnitude of rainfall especially the local
   convective heavy thunderstorm that may cause flash flood. Then, the
   hydrological model plays an important role to simulate the
   transformation of rainfall into run-off as part of a real time flood
   prediction system. Hydraulic model provides details of flow and stage
   for different locations and times of flood wave propagation. Improvement
   and coupling of all modeling system will allow for increased early
   warning lead-times to alleviate flood damage. To contribute in this
   research study to the early step of real time flood forecast, it has led
   to the option using remote sensing data to estimate the rainfall in a
   pilot study area. This article presents the investigation of the
   relation between rainfall measured by the synoptic stations and that
   forecasted from the meteorological satellite image taken by Japan's
   Geostationary Meteorological Satellite, GMS-5. The north basin of Pasak
   River in central Thailand was the area selected for this study.
   The observed rainfall from the synoptic stations located at Muang,
   Lomsak and Wichianburi Districts, Petchabun Province during wet season
   (May to October) of the years 1997 and 1998 were analyzed to find out
   the relations to the clou top temperature taken from the meteorological
   satellite image during the same period of time. As the results, the
   relation between rainfall and cloud top temperature could be revealed by
   the equations : P = 2.52 x 10(28) T-p(-11.411), P = 7.57 x 10(24)
   T-P(-9.555) and P = 1.796 x 10(26) T-p(-10.525) with the correlation
   coefficient (R-2) of 0.7527, 0.6829 and 0.8149 for rain gauge stations
   at the districts of Muang, Lomsak and Wichianburi respectively, where P
   is the value of rainfall in millimeter and T-p is the value of the cloud
   top temperature in degree Kelvin. Then, the empirical equations were
   used to estimate the rainfall during the wet season of the years 1999
   and 2000 in comparison with the actual rainfall measured from the
   corresponding synoptic stations during the same period of time. Such
   comparison gave the correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.8249, 0.6591 and
   0.8411 respectively. This result revealed that the estimated rainfall
   gave an acceptable relation with the values of actually measured at the
   same period of time. The result of this rainfall estimate is expected to
   challenge the further study to transform the estimated values of
   rainfall into the flood hydrograph using appropriate rainfall-runoff
   model. It can be conclude that this initiation is therefore,
   alternatively served as an initial challenge for further development of
   real time flood forecast using more sufficient and appropriate
   meteorological data from satellite imagery or other types of remote
   sensing observation.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at evaluating various rainfall estimation techniques to
   be used in the context of hydrological post-event investigations. The
   rich radar and rain gauge datasets collected during the 8-9 september
   2002 catastrophic rain event are considered for this purpose. Spatially
   variable radar calibration techniques based on the << hydrologic
   visibility >> concept and on raingauge-radar correction factors
   calculated at the event time scale are shown to significantly improve
   the consistency of the radar estimates with respect to independent rain
   gauge measurements at the hourly timescale. The analysis of the 8-9
   september 2002 rain estimates shows that the event is particularly
   remarkable by its spatial extent. It also presents a marked space-time
   structure which has certainly been influential in the flash flood and
   flood genesis over the affected region.}},

Abstract = {{Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing is the hottest. fastest growing
   application on the Internet. When designing Gnutella-like applications,
   the most important consideration is the scalability problem. Recently.
   different search protocols have been proposed to remedy the problems in
   Gnutella's flooding. However, congestion due to large query loads from
   users and peer heterogeneity definitely impact on the performance of
   search protocols, and this consideration has received little attention
   from the research community. In this paper, we propose a
   congestion-aware search protocol for unstructured P2P networks. The aim
   of our protocol is to integrate congestion control and object discovery
   functionality so that it can achieve good performance under congested
   networks and flash crowds. The simulation results show that our protocol
   can largely reduce a hit delay while maintaining a high hit rate, and
   the congestion problems such as query loss and system overloading can be
   effectively alleviated.}},

Abstract = {{South Asia has a typical Monsoon climate with rainy season mainly from
   June to September followed by a prolonged dry season of about 7 to 8
   months, covering winter and summer. Agriculture is the main occupation
   for majority of population. But the vagaries of Monsoon rainfall often
   threaten the crop production, sometimes due to prolonged droughts and
   sometimes due to flash floods. Most of the farmlands grow rain-fed crops
   with limited success. Irrigated agriculture, using locally available
   ground water or using surface water from canals, is limited to about
   10\% to 35\% of the sown area, depending upon the climate, development
   of water storages, topography, soil types, population density and the
   infrastructural facilities. Ground water plays an important role and is
   responsible for providing irrigation to 30\% to 70\% of the irrigated
   farmlands in different regions. Ground water also provides over 70\% of
   drinking water supply in rural areas. Exploration and sustainable use of
   ground water in alluvial regions as well as in the hard rock regions is,
   therefore, the foundation of rural development in South Asia. Due to
   population pressure in the countries in South Asia, the number of
   irrigation dug-wells and bore-wells is increasing every year. Water
   table is getting depleted, especially in low-rainfall, semi-arid
   regions. In costal aquifers, sea water encroachment is taking place. In
   urban areas, pollution of ground water has become a major problem. This
   paper examines different issues related to ground water development in
   South Asia. In near future, the climatic pattern is going to be harsher,
   causing flash floods and severe droughts. In the Monsoon climate of
   South Asia the danger of such a climatic pattern is even more serious
   due to population pressure. The importance of watershed management
   cannot be overemphasized under such conditions. A watershed is the
   interface or meeting point of climatology and hydrology. If the
   watershed is well-managed for conservation of soil, water and biomass,
   it would be capable of absorbing the climatic shocks. This paper
   therefore advocates participatory management of watersheds and
   augmentation of recharge to ground water, for ensuring sustainability of
   ground water supply of suitable quality and of adequate quantity.}},

Abstract = {{Severe damages due to flash flooding within a park and center of
   downtown Ashland directly threatened the economic viability of the town,
   which is heavily dependent on tourism. It also impacted the quality of
   life for residents drawn to the considerable amenities offered by this
   small community. Park trails are heavily used by residents as well as
   visitors, and the Calle Guanajuato, where the creek is bordered by
   sidewalk cafes, is a special magnet for tourists. Although traditional
   environmental concerns were of great importance in the ``restoration{''}
   of flood-damaged Ashland Creek, it was the recreational value of the
   creek and its importance to the area's economy that was of paramount
   importance. This fact is reflected in the unique approaches to urban
   creek corridor rehabilitation discussed here. This case study
   demonstrates some of the problems as well as design opportunities which
   arise when ``conventional{''} thinking on stream restoration, which has
   generally been focused on fish in the Pacific Northwest, must contend
   with both the legacy effects of past impacts and the premium that many
   cities and towns now place on watercourses as recreational and visual
   assets for the community.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the Earth's climate and how it responds to climate
   perturbations relies on knowledge of how atmospheric moisture, clouds,
   latent heating, and the large-scale circulation vary with changing
   climate conditions. The physical process that links these key climate
   elements is precipitation. GPM will establish a benchmark for global
   rainfall, building upon the highly successful joint US/Japan Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). GPM's global atmospheric monitoring
   of water and energy will be a key contributor to answering the science
   research strategy questions: (1) How are global precipitation,
   evaporation, and the cycling of water changing? (2) How are variations
   in local weather, precipitation, and water resources related to global
   climate variation? (3) How can weather forecast duration and reliability
   be improved by new space-based observations, data assimilation and
   modeling? In an era of climatic uncertainty we need to be able to
   detect, understand and react to early signs that rainfall patterns may
   be changing in concert with better-understood climate variables. The
   transient nature of rainfall makes the detection of subtle changes
   difficult. Rainfall information over similar to3 hours time scale is
   needed to improve weather forecast models, data assimilation models,
   hydrological models and flash flood forecasts. GPM will substantially
   improve upon the temporal and spatial coverage of TRMM and extend the
   measurement of rainfall globally. Global Precipitation Measurement is a
   global endeavor that has sparked global interest. It has received
   overwhelming endorsement from the World Climate Research Programme, the
   World Meteorological Organization, and the Committee on Earth
   Observation Satellites. Japan's National Space Development Agency
   (NASDA) plans to contribute the radar for and launch of a core
   satellite. The European Space Agency (ESA) is currently conducting a
   feasibility study for a European constellation satellite contribution to
   GPM. India and France have expressed their interest in participating
   through the Megha-Tropiques project. South Korea is proposing the
   contribution of a constellation satellite bus in addition to regional
   ground validation sites. Other nations are also expected to play major a
   role in GPM. GPM is now in Formulation Phase and is one of the highest
   priority new missions for which NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE)
   seeks final approval. GPM launches are targeted to begin in 2009.}},

Abstract = {{The characterization of flash flood is an opened subject. We can notice
   several characteristics. The precipitation responsible of their
   formation are violent and intense; catchments concerned are small or
   medium; the surface runoff is the main flood generator; and the
   infiltration plays a role in the losses evaluation of the rain measured.
   To simulate and to forecast such events, we use two deterministic,
   distributed and conceptual models : TOPMODEL and MARINE. MARINE is an
   operational and robust tool for flash flood forecasting already
   implemented in National Flood Forecast Service in order to be tested. It
   should supply pertinent data about the flood evolution for people
   responsible of forecast and should be applicable even for sparse
   historical and observed data with the integration of data from space
   imagery.
   The choice of the physical processes responsible of the rapid flood
   generation, adopted in these models, are very different. On the one hand
   the saturated contributive surfaces are modeled through the TOPMODEL
   concept; and on the other hand the rooting of the surface runoff is the
   factor determining of the flood genesis in the rainfall - runoff MARINE.
   To try to understand which is more appropriated than the other to
   simulate those particular floods, these two models are tested on two
   small French Mediterranean catchments for rapid floods that occurred
   recently. The calibration of these models is delicate, because the
   parameters have to keep physical meaning. Furthermore, we plan their use
   in real time forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of weather radar has provided the potential to estimate
   rainfall accurately at high spatial and temporal resolutions. When these
   estimates are input to a distributed hydrological model, forecasts of
   streamflow may be used to anticipate, and thus mitigate, the potential
   hazards associated with a flash flood. In hydrological modelling,
   forecast uncertainty has traditionally been a function of the
   uncertainty in the model parameters, and in some cases the model
   structure. The study presented here uses the physics-based, distributed
   r.water.fea hydrological model with modifications to address the impact
   of uncertainties in the input rainfall estimates on streamflow
   predictions using an extension of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty
   Estimation methodology. The ensemble modelling approach allows us to
   evaluate the accuracy of different rainfall algorithms independently at
   the scale of an integrating watershed. The study plan and some initial
   results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{AVS in collaboration with Linkoping University are developing a Visual
   User Interface and Web-enabled advanced 3D visualization to a flood
   forecasting system in an EC funded project named MUSIC. The project
   develops state-of-the-art precipitation estimation algorithms, assess
   their uncertainty and use an innovative combination of the output data
   of the three independent data sources radar, satellite and rain gauges.
   The basic role of any real-time quantitative precipitation and flood
   forecasting system lies in its capability, within the forecasting
   horizon, of assessing and reducing the uncertainty in forecasts of
   future events in order to allow improved warnings and operational
   decisions for the reduction of flood risk. In line with this
   requirement, the MUSIC project is to develop an innovative technique for
   improving the weather radar, weather satellite and rain gauge derived
   precipitation data, taken as independent measurement source. Another key
   objective is seeking to improve the communication and the dissemination
   of results to the authorities involved in real-time flood forecasting
   and management. The project tests the system on real world case studies
   on two test catchments the Reno and Arno rivers in Italy. AVS and LiU
   are developing the innovative 3D Visual User Interface that will enable
   the users to take a more active role in the process of visualising and
   investigating flood forecasting, allowing them to better understand the
   data and uncertainty behind the forecasting system. LiU also provides
   easy-to-use collaborative visualization tools enabling the
   meteorologists, hydrologists, operations managers and the civil defence
   manager to view and discuss the forecasting results in real time across
   the network before finally interacting with the media, the police, other
   officials and the public. The system will considerably improve the flash
   flood forecasting reliability and precision and will shorten the time
   required to detect events that lead to catastrophic flood events.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents detailed trend analyses of the hydroclimatic
   patterns in the Tet River basin, a typical coastal river in the south of
   France. We investigated the period 1980-2000. Average temperatures
   during this period were among the warmest of the last century, and
   possible trends may allow an evaluation of the response of this river to
   future climate change. Our results show that the average annual
   temperature in the basin shows a highly significant trend towards
   increasing temperatures. Mean annual runoff from the basin is highly
   variable and shows no clear trend over the Study period. Annual maximum
   discharge values, however, follow a trend towards increasing values.
   This trend is only present in the downstream part of the basin, at the
   gauging station close to the river mouth, but it is absent further
   upstream, in the Mountainous part of the basin. The evolution of
   precipitation is consistent with this pattern. Although mean annual
   precipitation over the entire basin also shows no clear evolution in
   terms of its absolute values, it is found that the contribution from the
   highest basin parts decreased whereas the contribution from the middle
   and lower basin parts increased.}},

Abstract = {{The Western Mediterranean area is commonly affected by heavy rainfall
   and floods, mainly in the autumn. In particular, during 1996-2000, an
   important number of catastrophic floods have affected Spain, Italy and
   France. In this paper, the meteorological situations of heavy rainfall
   events produced in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula between 1996
   and 2000 have been analysed. During this period, catastrophic (June
   2000, October 2000, ...) and extraordinary floods (January 1996, August
   1999, ...) occurred during different seasons of the year. First, the
   precipitation data obtained from an automatic network constituted by 126
   raingauges have been analysed with the aim of classifying the events
   from a temporal and spatial point of view. Secondly, a meteorological
   study (thermodynamic, synoptic and mesoscale analysis) has been done for
   the most important events in order to identify the main factors
   responsible for the rainfall and the event evolution. Specific
   consideration of Mediterranean cyclogenesis has been made in relation to
   the MEDEX project (WMO). The analysis has been completed with the data
   from the meteorological radar of Barcelona. Although all this
   information will allow an improvement in the knowledge of these kind of
   events and their forecasting in the Mediterranean region, specific work
   has been done to improve the nowcasting of convective systems by using
   the radar information.}},

Title = {{The Agly river: long-term evolution and present fluvial dynamics of a
   coastal stream}},
Journal = {{HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU}},
Year = {{2003}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{137-146}},
Abstract = {{A research work on the Agly fluvial system and its drainage basin,
   (1,045 km(2)) is presented following a systemic approach. Various
   spatio-temporal scales allow to get a, long-term view of evolution and
   dynamics of this Mediterranean coastal river, since its gradual sinking
   in a mid-Miocene planation surface., Selective erosion and structural
   features account for the angular channel network, while quaternary
   sediment deposits depend on morphoclimatic conditions.
   Flash-floods are induced by heavy storm events and are a determining
   factor in the fluvial dynamics. A major obstacle to social development,
   these flash-floods have been considered as ``the scourge of the
   country{''} ever since the XVIIIth century. Modelling the flood wave
   propagation reveals the,importance of relief and channel network
   characteristics for the transfer processes, A, quantification of the
   sediment, transport by the Agly river underscores a very low bed load
   transport, whereas suspended sediment (TSS) and total dissolved solids
   (TDS), in about equal amounts, account by far for the major part of the
   transport. Total sediment yield for the entire basin can be estimated at
   200-10(3) t-year(-1).
   The fluvial geomorphology shows a,recent deepening of the inner
   channels, related both to human activities and to natural processes;
   this river metamorphosis has occurred in the second half of the XXth
   century and has, been so short, that it could be considered as an
   epiphenomenon in the river's long story. The dam and dikes built against
   ``aiguats `` (combined storm events and floods), must not lead to
   overlook natural events : the Mediterranean region will always remain
   dangerous for human activities because of its sudden,. heavy downpours
   and its powerfull coastal streams.}},

Abstract = {{Yihe and Shuhe Rivers are two big flash flood rivers in the Yi - Shu -

   Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, with a drainage area of 21,070 km(2). At
   the upper reaches of the rivers is the Yimeng Mountain Area, where stand
   chain of mountains and rivers flow in valleys. At the lower reaches, are
   alluvial plains, where the river channels are flat, though the cross
   section is large, yet the flood carrying capacity is poor, and the
   foreland has very poor erosion resisting capacity. Because of the steep
   slope of the river bed at the upper reaches, many tributaries but with
   short river channels, and large water catchment area, so the characters
   of the flood in Yihe and Shuhe Rivers, such as short distance to the
   source and rapid flow, high bomb and large volume, sudden rising and
   sudden falling are formed. Whenever the flood season comes, flash floods
   with sediment rush down the mountains, scour right and left in the
   winding river channels, cause the foreland to slough, and form many
   dangerous works of bank failure, which directly threaten the safety of
   the levees and the villages along the rivers. In order to stabilize the

Abstract = {{The Gulf Coastal states region of United States is prone to the highest
   national frequency of both severe weather and climate problems
   accompanied by economic losses (e.g., severe convection, flooding,
   tropical cyclones, ice storms etc.,). A GIS/Remote Sensing framework is
   necessary to properly understand physical processes, investigate cause
   and affect relationships and develop conceptual models of the behavior
   of environmental systems. Our goals included focusing on the
   environmental effects and impacts of heavy rains and flash flooding and
   finally to produce a prototype GIS/RS Environmental Risk Assessment
   System (ERAISA) for the region of interest. We selected ``The historic
   Southeast Louisiana and Southern Mississippi flood activity during May
   8-10th, 1995{''} as our study case. The NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale model
   (MM5) is used to study the effects of warm sea surface temperature
   anomalies, sea surface pressure and winds on the precipitation
   characteristics of this event. Mesoscale model simulations are used to
   forecast and better understand the physics associated with the flood
   event. Each component is modified to accommodate the detailed study. For
   the preliminary model run, a doubly nested domain centered over the
   Central Gulf of Mexico with grid spacing of 90 km and 30 km is employed.
   MM5 is run for each 6 hr period, from the initial storm development -
   May 8(th) and through May 10(th). NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and synoptic
   data are used for constructing the initial and boundary conditions. The
   model simulations are compared with Radar data for further comparisons
   and validations. The phenomenon of interest - flooding here is narrowly
   defined in order to depict, analyze and predict (or manage)
   environmental dynamics through the use and application of GIS and Remote
   Sensing (RS) data and technologies. A major goal is to unify our
   understanding and knowledge of similar historic events into a more
   comprehensive integrative framework from different disciplines -
   meteorology, marine and fisheries sciences, environmental sciences etc.,
   and develop a system of Integrated Environmental Risk Assessment for the
   Gulf Coast, which would be ultimately used for operational use.}},

Abstract = {{In October 1998, (Hurricane Mitch) the water level of Lake Managua
   (Nicaragua) rose about 4 m. The water level is still so high that there
   is evident risk of a serious flash flood. There was a need for forecasts
   of the water level. There were no telemetric hydrological data
   available. So the only possibility was to use precipitation data from
   meteorological stations and water level observations. Three different
   forecasts were developed: a monthly forecast for the rainy season, a
   monthly forecast for the dry season and a flash flood forecast. It was
   found that three daily reporting meteorological stations were enough for
   the flash flood forecast. The flash flood model has been tested using
   observations during Hurricane Mitch. Correlation coefficients of the
   water level forecasts in the model and observed water levels were r =
   0.99 for the 1-day forecast and r = 0.98 for the 2-day forecast.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are characterized by their violence and the rapidity of
   their occurrence. Because they don't occur frequently and are so
   unpredictable their anticipation is still subject to research : when
   flash floods occur, tools usually used by the Sercice d'Annonce des
   Crues (SAC : national flood forecast services of France) are not
   efficient to protect people form this kind of event. Our main goal here
   is to develop an operational and robust methodology for flash flood
   forecasting. This methodology should give relevant data about the flood
   evolution and should be applicable even if historical and observed data
   are sparse.
   The flash flood evolution model that we have developed consists in two
   steps : first, the flood runoff generation in the upstream part of the
   basin, then it's propagation in the main river. Flash flood generation
   model (MARINE) is a rainfall - runoff model that only integrates data
   from space. Classical hydrology equations are resolved with enough
   hypothesis to allow real time exploitation. The minimum data required by
   the model are the Digital Elevation Model, used to calculate slopes that
   generate runoff, the rainfall data from meteorological radar and the
   soil properties viewed from space and that have hydrological influence
   (land cover map, main rivers). Flood propagation model resolves Saint
   Venant equations and simulates flood propagation in main rivers.
   In this paper, we will insist on the hypotheses we did to simplify
   hydraulic equations and their resolution in our model to do so we based
   our analysis on known past events defining how space data can replace
   observed data in hydrological simulation.
   This analysis has been tested in a 2D flood propagation model. Results
   for the Aude flood of November 1999 are very encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{The catastrophic flooding on the 18th of October, 1973, in the dry
   stream (rambla) of Albu (n) over tilde ol caused the loss of 46 lives,
   the destruction of 91 houses and serious damages to 141. A layer of mud
   (2 to 3 metres thick) covered the streets of La Rabita (the village most
   damaged). The roads and the bridges of comunication between the town and
   the rest of the province were destroyed along with 250 hectares of
   cultivated land. The damages were estimated at 300 millions of pesetas.
   A heavy rainstorm (600 mm) produced the rapid development of a high
   density flow in the dry stream, with an elevated volume of sediments
   (113 of the discharge), that was the responsible factor of the high
   discharge reachedduring the flood (2580 m(3)/s).
   The object of this study is not only the identification of the episode
   and the analysis of the disaster's social impact, but also to analyse
   the different techniques to study the flooding in this type of fluvial
   system. The historic reconstruction of the event includes an analysis of
   the social impact and restoration works of the affected area. In
   addition the hydrologic analyses of the flooding that was based on the
   study of the greatest floods in small basins has been carried out.
   Finally, a morphodynamic and sedimentologic reconstruction was
   undertaken. The sedimentological study of deposits corresponding to the
   flash flood shows that the dynamic nature of these alluvial channels has
   important implications for floodplain management policy. The potencial
   for dramatic changes in geomorphic and hydrologic characteristics of
   alluvial channels must be considered in establishing procedures for
   flood hazard evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The disastrous flood on the Tepla River, which afflicted the spa town of
   Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad) in 1582 originated from thunderstorms with
   cloudburst. The flushing water damaged dams of many local fish ponds in
   the upper part of the river basin. All sites situated near the river
   banks were flooded. Situated on the lower reach of the Tepla R. before
   its opening from the right into the Oh e (Eger) R., the spa Carlsbad was
   hit by the flood wave after 17.00 and was largely devastated. The high
   water took away about 36 houses and tens of people lost their lives. The
   disaster was depicted by numerous occasional prints in German language,.
   A discourse on the flood was also written in Latin. A detailed Czech
   description is contained in the period chronicle by the Prague humanist
   Marek Bydzovsky of Florentine. This natural disaster is apparently the
   oldest flash flood recorded in detail from Czech territory.}},

Abstract = {{Natural geological hazards such as flash floods, landslides, debris
   flows and mudflows have caused, and will continue to cause, many
   problems in Malawi. Landslide risks are primarily a geological problem
   and it is Quaternary geology that concerns our environment most. It is a
   typical geological task to reconstruct the old events using geological,
   geomorphological and dating methods and based on these results, predict
   possible future disasters. Our studies of old and recent debris flow
   events in Southern Malawi have found out that these phenomena are mainly
   triggered by tropical cyclones that bring heavy rainfalls. They occur in
   mountain slopes with certain slope instability, soil cover and
   discontinuity patterns of the underlying rocks. Human impacts on the
   environment such as large scale earthworks projects and replacement of
   natural forests by non endemic tree species have also played an
   important role in a rising risk of flash floods and debris flows, It is
   recommended that the most sustainable method of mitigation against these
   hazards is to incorporate the geological hazard zoning maps into town
   and regional planning schemes. Where this may not be possible, measures
   that can reduce or minimise the hazard impact should be adopted.
   Zomba Mountain is made of a Mesozoic syenite pluton that intruded
   Precambrian high-grade metamorphic gneisses and granulites. Weathering
   erosion and uplift have left the syenite standing at an elevation of
   2000 meters while the surrounding area is between 700 and 1000 meters
   above sea level. Zomba town is located at the foot of the mountain.
   Steep slopes with up to 50degrees, the highly jointed syenite, and the
   thick lateritic soil covers are the main factors likely to influence
   rock, instability, Debris flows triggered by heavy rainfall have
   affected Zomba since memorial times. People of Zomba and the authorities
   are well aware of past landslides and the continued risk. As a result
   from our investigations the detailed risk zoning of Zomba contributes to
   the disaster preparedness plan of the town.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of the flash floods that occurred in the
   Llobregat basin (Catalonia, NE Iberian Peninsula) on 10 June 2000 in the
   context of the historical floods recorded since the 14th century and the
   climatic framework. To this end, the study shows the rainfall and
   meteorological analysis of the episode from a dual objective: to
   understand the main factors which gave rise to rainfall exceeding 150 mm
   in three hours, and to be able to compare it with previous situations.
   Such situations have been classified, in the light of the information
   available.
   Although no catastrophic episode occurred in spring during the period
   1950-1999, the most similar one from a meteorological point of view and
   in terms of the area affected was the one recorded in September 1962.
   Between 1780 and 1950 there are records of 44 flood episodes at the
   mouth of the River Llobregat, of which 6 were catastrophic, and 38
   extraordinary. From all of them, 8 events were recorded in spring: one
   catastrophic, on 26 May 1853, and the other seven were extraordinary.
   The 1794 episode shows certain similarities to the 2000 episode.
   The analysis of the total series reaches the conclusion that of the 171
   flood events that have been recorded between the years 1300 and 2000 at
   the mouth of the Llobregat river, 69 of them were ordinary, 81 were
   extraordinary and 21 were catastrophic.}},

Abstract = {{A number of urban areas have experienced severe flooding in the past.
   The problem has worsened in southern Europe in the past decades mainly
   due to urbanisation, which has lead to the paving of natural ground
   surfaces and the blocking of natural watercourses by the infrastructure.
   In some areas this has aggravated the situation by shortening the
   hydrological response time, often triggering flash floods within few
   hours after the occurrence of heavy precipitation. The short time
   between the occurrence of heavy rain and corresponding flooding makes it
   difficult to forecast, especially when the meteorological conditions are
   such that it is difficult to forecast the rainfall. This is especially
   the case for coastal cities in mountainous terrain.
   In order to get sufficient lead time to alarm inhabitants and plan
   reactive measures, it has been found important to use advanced
   forecasting and monitoring techniques and a decision support system to
   assist authorities in their decision making.
   This article contains a concise presentation of a decision support
   system (DSS) developed to assist public authorities plan emergency
   activities when flooding is expected and to give guidance for
   restoration activities after the flood subsides. The DSS is designed
   mainly to work for areas with steep topography. Such areas are known to
   experience flash floods only a few hours after the occurrence of a
   severe precipitation event. The target areas are Liguria Region in Italy
   and the Greater Athens catchment in Greece. Severe and devastating
   flooding has occurred at both sites several times in the past two
   decades.
   The study shows that the problem of flood warning based on forecasts is
   one of great complexity and uncertainty. It is believed that results can
   be improved with better forecasting techniques, improving catchment
   models, with experience using the DSS, and increasing experience of the
   public about the meaning of flood warnings. The system developed can be
   easily applied in other areas with similar flooding problems.}},

Abstract = {{In the first week of October 1999, heavy rain events occurred in the
   Eastern slope of the Eastern Sierra Madre of Mexico, with important
   consequences in at least four states of this country. The effects of the
   rainfall were a few thousand mass movements, erosion and loss of
   topsoil, flash floods, and extensive flooding. Damage in three-out of
   the four states accounted for 384 deaths, 66 missing, 212 municipalities
   with damages, 39 rivers that burst their banks, around 198,000 people
   were affected, and 48,000 houses affected to a varying degree. In
   addition, there was a lot of damage to roads and bridges, and serious
   wreckage to agriculture (data provided by the governments of Puebla,
   Veracruz, and Hidalgo). Economic losses were massive. In the state of
   Puebla alone, it is estimated that over 200 million dollars (U.S. \$)
   will be needed for restoring damaged infrastructure (government report,
   Jan. 15, 2000).
   This document shows the most relevant aspects of this disaster that took
   place in the first week of October 1999. It begins by exposing the
   general features of the area, such as physiography and rainfall
   patterns, and describes the meteorological phenomenon that caused such
   widespread damage, by analyzing the rainfall registered during the
   critical days. The paper continues by stressing the geological
   characteristics and other causes that contributed to the mass movements
   in the Sierra Norte of Puebla state. Finally, damages in different
   states are described, and a few conclusions and recommendations are put
   forward.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of the watershed runoff response to rainfall is an essential
   element of flood-warning and preparedness programs. The reliability of
   estimated runoff is an important aspect of successful programs.
   Methodologies for observing spatially distributed rainfall (radar
   rainfall) and for obtaining other gridded watershed data are
   continuously evolving. The increasing availability of spatially
   distributed data creates opportunity for improving rainfall-runoff
   modeling. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Hydrologic Engineering
   Center (HEC) has developed a watershed modeling program, HEC-HMS, that
   has the capability to use spatially distributed rainfall and runoff
   parameters for runoff simulation. This capability and the associated
   applicability to flash floods are described.}},

   presented. The system applies the potential of GIS to processing
   information to different space-time scales. It integrates
   spatially-distributed hydrological models, oriented to runoff simulation
   and prediction, using topographical attributes extracted from a DEM. Its
   final aim is to assist Hydrological Information Automatic Systems (SAIH)
   in Spain, facilitating information management and use in real-time
   during alert and flash-flood situations typical of Mediterranean
   environments. Shyska has been applied to semiarid basins in southeast
   Spain, using pluviometric information from telemetric networks and the
   products of remote sensing, presenting satisfactory results. The
   sensitivity of results, both the spatial distribution of
   geomorphological and hydrodynamic parameters, to DEM resolution is
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The lofty mountain ranges of Bhutan Higher Himalaya having altitude +/-
   7000m are covered with perennial snow and give rise to a number of
   valley glaciers all along their southern slopes. The area of study lies
   just at the foot of these mountain ranges and represents a glacial
   landscape strewn with lakes, morainic ridges and glaciofluvial terraces.
   The rock types present in the area are granite gneisses belonging to
   Thimphu Group. The present study encompasses the geomorphological and
   geoenvironmental aspects of the area. This mainly includes processes of
   formation of dangerous glacial lakes, which cause devastating flash
   floods on bursting. This glacial belt which forms the upper catchment of
   Sankosh (Pho Chu) river has had a history of flash floods caused by the
   bursting of glacial lakes. The latest devastating flash floods took
   place in 1994, which were caused by the bursting of glacial lake in the
   Lunana area. Another glacial lake is in a critical state since a
   sizeable part of its morainic dam was washed away due to the flash
   floods of 1994. The evolution of this glacial lake and its hydrological,
   bathymetric and safety aspects are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, flood is the number one cause of losses from natural events.
   Flood insurance has attracted more and more attention in recent years,
   not only in the fields of science and politics but also within the
   insurance industry itself. Although the list of great natural disasters
   is headed by storms, and despite the relatively low density of insurance
   against flooding, the large number of local flood events constitutes a
   large interest for the insurance industry. Flooding comes in various
   forms, ranging from storm surges to flash floods and from sometimes
   country-wide river floods to glacial lake outburst and dam break floods.
   These different forms of flooding are important when it comes to
   insurance concepts, for which adverse selection plays an important role.
   Various concepts for the field of flood insurance have been investigated
   and discussed in different countries. In Germany, the insurance
   industry, in a combined effort, has launched a project to identify zones
   of similar risk resulting from river floods for the whole country. The
   identification of possible clients and the calculation of premiums are
   two uses of the developed model, as well as the assessment of probable
   maximum losses. Only river floods are considered in the model, flash
   floods and storm surges are excluded; flood control measures are not
   taken into account either.}},

   regional drainage networks are proposed as a contribution to the
   enhancement of the present flash flood forecasting capabilities in the
   presence of uncertainty. The statistical properties that morphologically
   describe the distribution of contributing areas within a regional
   drainage system are analyzed in order to investigate the `resonance'
   between the scales of the hydrological response at the ground and those
   of the internal variability of rainfall fields. Combination of these two
   distributions provides the resonance probability that, within a given
   storm morphology described at the large scale, any resonant component
   exists able to make critical a given class of drainage basins in the
   region.}},

Abstract = {{A GIS-based assessment of landslide risk to the Cairns community has
   been carried out to provide information to the Cairns City Council for
   planning and emergency management purposes. Magnitude recurrence
   relations were tentatively established for landslides on the hill
   slopes; and large debris flows extending out from the gully systems on
   to the plains. From the recurrence relations, landslide hazard was
   estimated. The elements at risk were ascertained by interrogating the
   GIS, and their vulnerabilities were assessed, Specific risk and total
   risk maps were produced. Landslide risk may increase as development
   extends further into the hill slopes, Large debris flows could impact on
   subdivisions at the base of the slopes. Blockage by landslides of roads
   and railways can cause isolation of the community. Flash flooding in
   Freshwater Creek, or debris flows, have the potential to disrupt the
   Cairns water supply by blocking the intake or destroying sections of the
   pipeline.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are widely considered as very fast developing catastrophic
   floods resulting from short, intense rainfalls on steep topography.
   Their high-energy and mass transfer potential can be, through
   accelerated erosion mechanisms, the cause or trigger for the occurrence
   of other natural hazards such as shallow mass movement phenomena
   (slides, flows, falls etc.). As with most natural phenomena, flash
   floods need a systemic approach for effectively appreciating their
   dynamic properties including engaged external/internal factors that
   interact, and a rational assessment of their potential impacts. In
   planning a set of structural or non-structural measures for coping with
   flash floods in a particular case, there are some key knowledge points
   that can lead both to optimal selection (under the existing
   constraints), and realization of the mixture of measures. An overview of
   those key points related to the concept of a systemic approach and to
   appropriate engineering geological issues are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Abundant rainfall, which occurred in Europe in 1997, caused many flash
   floods. They made considerable devastation particularly in the montane
   and submontane regions. Valleys of bigger streams, as well as steep,
   easily eroding slopes underwent the biggest changes. In the Babiogorski
   National Park, on northern slopes of Babia Gora Mt. (the Western
   Carpathians, the High Beskid) numerous new initial habitats (slump and
   gravel heaps) appeared in the stream valleys. Before the flood, the
   dominant types of the alluvial vegetation were Petasitetum kablikiani
   and phytocoenoses of alder trees - Alnetum incanae variant with
   Petasiles kablikianus. Therefore the extensive populations of butterbur
   (P kablikianus) had the significant importance in plant consolidation of
   the riverbed. As the effect of geomorphological water action underwent
   three types of gravel heaps. The object of this study is the
   investigation the processes and dynamics of overgrowing with plants of
   recent alluvial habitats, and especially the role of Petasites
   kablikianus in forming new plant cover. In the Babiogorski National
   Park, in the Rybny stream valley, where plant cover of the alluvia was
   extremely natural, there were established three permanent plots on three
   types of habitats. Each year there are performed observations in the
   squares (20x20 cm). Floral composition, percentage cover of the species
   and its life form arc stated for each square. After two years of
   observations pioneer species, the most abundant species, their frequency
   on analysed plots and three strategies of territorial occupancy for
   Petasites kablikianus were ascertained.}},

   South Australia}},

Abstract = {{An Australian circular mesoscale convective system (MCS) is examined
   using available surface and upper air analyses as well as satellite
   imagery. The MCS formed over central South Australia on 5 February 1997
   and lasted approximately nine hours. It is found that MCS generation
   occurred following anomalous southward penetration of the monsoon trough
   over Australia. This penetration into southern Australia resulted in an
   input of extremely moist and unstable tropical air over the region
   which, together with the development of complex of shallow lows and
   troughs within the main monsoon trough, led to generation of the MCS.
   During the lifespan of the MCS, rainfall amounts in excess of 100 mm
   (and up to 175 mm over a four hour period at certain locations) were
   recorded with accompanying flash flooding and severe damage.
   A low in the middle levels of the atmosphere was responsible for the
   eventual decay of the storm. North to north-westerly winds winds around
   this low continually advected cloud away from the MCS towards the south
   and south east. This removal of cloud mass eventually led to dissipation
   of the MCS as it tracked away from the zone of maximum surface heating.
   Despite this storm just failing to meet the size criterion for mesoscale
   convective complex (MCC) status, it is very similar to ``typical{''}
   MCCs found elsewhere in the world in terms of its lifetime and nocturnal
   nature. Although mesoscale storms of this type are not rare in
   Australia, MCS's in South Australia make up only a small proportion of
   the total number of systems over south eastern Australia. These factors,
   in conjunction with the anomalous southward penetration of the monsoon
   trough and associated synoptic conditions, make this storm somewhat
   unusual.}},

Abstract = {{Bangladesh, the lowest riparian of the Ganges-Brahmaputra- Meghna basin,
   drains approximately 1.7 million square kilometer area with average
   annual runoff of approximately 175 billion cubic meter. Average Land
   elevation of the country is about 12.50 meter above mean sea level and
   it faces two extreme conditions : overabundence of surface runoff during
   wet season and scarcity during dry season. Overabundence of water during
   wet season creats flood situation on atmost one third of the country in
   a normal year while in extreme condition may rise upto two third
   (example 1988 \& 1998 flood in Bangladesh). Flood situation creates
   seasonal wetland in low lying areas which during wet season turns into
   water bodies sustaining wetland acqutic flora and funa while during dry
   season the same is converted into agricultural land. Over population, as
   elsewhere in the Globe, and consequently, over exploration of natural
   resources, of this unique geological feature. The natural and
   traditional water management system of these seasonal wetland has been
   changed due to human interference which should be managed in a
   sustainable way for pressure these unique geological feature.}},
