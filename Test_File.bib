abstract = {Vulnerability assessment implies a quantitative evaluation of the
individual vulnerability components such as elements at risk, their
physical exposure and social characteristics. Current approaches in
vulnerability research are driven by a divide between social scientists
who tend to view vulnerability as representing a set of socio-economic
factors, and scientists who view vulnerability in terms of the degree of
loss to an element at risk. To close this gap, a multi-dimensional
vulnerability analysis has been undertaken focusing on flash flood
hazards in Greece. To represent physical vulnerability, an empirical
relation between the process intensity and the degree of loss was
established. With respect to social vulnerability, an assessment was
undertaken by means of empirical data collection based on a door-to-door
survey. In general, both physical and social vulnerability was
comparable low, which is interpreted as a result from (a) specific
building regulations in Greece as well as general design principles
leading to less structural susceptibility of elements at risk exposed,
and (b) a relatively low economic loss leading to less social
vulnerability of citizens exposed. It is shown that a combination of
different perspectives of vulnerability will lead to a better
understanding of perceptions of actors regarding their vulnerabilities
and capacities.},

abstract = {Urban and land use planning is conditioned by flood risk analyses and is
a great research challenge. While methods are available for quantitative
hazard and risk modeling, there is still a major gap related to reliable
rational approaches for vulnerability assessment. This is particularly
true for assessing vulnerability of buildings to floods. This
vulnerability, which is important for economic reasons as well as for
the safety of individuals and communities, is usually conceptualized on
an empirical basis. Such empirical approaches, however, are plagued by
considerable uncertainties, mostly because the damage-causing mechanisms
on the building envelope are poorly represented. In order to advance
this area, this paper focuses on the structural vulnerability of
traditional masonry buildings in alpine areas exposed to flash floods. A
simplified physically based conceptual model which requires a limited
amount of input data is proposed. The resistance of a wall impacted by a
flash flood is studied in a limit analysis framework, considering
different geometric ratios and building configurations. The resulting
stability thresholds, expressed in dimensionless form as a function of
the water depth, were positively compared with the results provided by
numerical finite element models of the investigated geometries. The
application of the proposed vulnerability model in risk mitigation
strategies provides reliable information, suitable for a first-level
risk assessment on large building stocks.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the detailed hydrometeorological
circumstances that lead to accidental casualties, and to better
understand the prominent physical factors of risk. Based on an event
that affected the Gard region (Southern France) in September 2002, it is
a first attempt to combine analysis of the physical and human response
to Mediterranean storms.
After details concerning the methodology (for meteorological,
hydrological and casualty analysis), the local context and the event,
the authors examine two points: the dynamics of the event (flash-flood
and riverine-flood response to the storm) together with human exposure
on the one hand, and scale as a critical problem affecting flood risk on
the other.
This investigation stresses the specificity of small catchments, which
are more dangerous both in hydrological and human terms. Moreover, this
contribution linking social sciences and geophysics constitutes an
important step in what {\{}[{\}}Morss, R.E., Wilhelmi, O.V., Downton, M.W.,

abstract = {Six years after the devastating M-s 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake, new
landslides, debris flows, and flash floods still occur frequently in the
earthquake-stricken regions. This shows that the geological hazards that
occur after a major earthquake in a mountainous environment can be a
long-term threat. However, post-earthquake reconstruction and relocation
of local residents often neglect this evolving threat, and its
interaction with existing and rebuilt houses has not been well studied.
Here we show that the evolving mountain environment, including the
changed geographic distribution of new landslides and the continuously
uplifting riverbed, creates emerging risks for existing and rebuilt
houses. We use spatial analysis of landslide debris and the location of
houses from high-resolution images and field survey in the study area
and find that new landslides and the houses rebuilt after the Wenchuan
earthquake have a similar trend of moving to lower elevations, gentler
slopes, and closer to rivers. This study confirms that the persistent
downward movement of landslide debris has rapidly filled up riverbeds
over the past 6 years. The elevated riverbeds make the study area
extremely susceptible to flash floods, creating further risks to newly
rebuilt houses that are closer to the river. We highlight the often
neglected dynamic process that involves changes in the natural
environment and man-made constructions and their interaction. This
dynamic process requires long-term monitoring and adaptive management of
mountainous regions after major earthquakes that can fully consider the
so-phisticated evolving risks caused by the changing environment,
exposure, and vulnerability in the region.},
