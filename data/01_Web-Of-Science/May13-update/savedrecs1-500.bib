Abstract = {{In the last years, metropolitan areas are more and more exposed to
   natural risks often intensified by the effects of climatic changes.
   Clear and complete information about hazards impending on the territory
   is indispensable for local authorities to define efficient territorial
   management strategies focused on the risk reduction. A flexible hazard
   tool which works at different scale and with several sources of hazard
   is here proposed. We drew maps of monothematic and synthetic indices to
   describe the hazard status of metropolitan areas. A hazard hotspot map
   was also elaborated to identify both the areas with high hazard for the
   single dangerous event and the areas characterized by the concomitance
   of several hazards. We computed hazard indices for Napoli and Pozzuoli,
   a densely populated area, located in the Somma-Vesuvio and Campi Flegrei
   multi-source volcanic zone and also exposed to landslide, flood and
   coastal erosion hazard.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood has been increasing in the Khartoum area, Sudan due to
   geographical conditions and climatic change as heavy rainfall and high
   temperature, therefore the present work tried to estimate the
   sensitivity of flash flood. The present work proposes an advanced
   technique of flood sensitivity mapping using the method of analytical
   hierarchy process. Ten factors as elevation, slope, distance from the
   network, land use, density of the drainage, flow accumulation, surface
   roughness, stream power index, topographic wetness index and curvature
   of the topography were digitized and then contributed in the mapping of
   Flash flood. Remote sensing data were integrated with analytical
   hierarchy process to determine the flood sensitive area in Sudan. The
   model was applied and completed as the consistency ratio was mostly
   reasonable (<0.1). Based on the proposed model, about 75.56 Km(2) (12.26
   \%), 156.14 Km(2) (25.33\%), 169.89 Km(2) (27.56 \%), 141.40 Km(2)
   (22.94 \%) and 73.50 Km(2) (11.92 \%); were classified as no
   susceptible, low susceptible, high susceptible, moderate susceptible and
   very highly susceptible to flooding. The present study showed a high
   variation in flood sensitivity due to climatic change and geographic
   condition. This index can be modified and applied in areas of the same
   characteristics of climatic conditions as one of the main recommendation
   in the study area. The study showed that poor infrastructure and lack of
   preparedness were the main causes of the disaster of flood in Sudan.
   This study merely demonstrated the critical analysis of geospatial
   mapping in proper mitigating, sustainable development and great
   monitoring the negative effects of flooding along the Khartoum region to
   reduce hazards of flood. (c) 2020 GJESM. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The northwestern Mediterranean coast is one of the areas most affected
   by flash floods and adverse weather, where also global climate scenarios
   are predicting an increase in precipitation extremes. This, along with
   the sealevel rise and the associated potential infrastructure and
   economical losses, represents a major risk for coastal settlements, as
   the one studied in this work: a major touristic area on the southern
   coast of Catalonia. The objective of the present paper is, thus, to
   understand in-depth the behavior of convective activity in the area and
   its link with flash flood events, to improve adverse and severe weather
   early warning systems in a rapidly changing weather as an adaptation
   measure. With this purpose, the study focuses on the period 2014-2018,
   analyzing the convective cells and storm motion in the region of study,
   through the new identification and tracking algorithm developed by the
   authors and applied in the Meteorological Service of Catalonia. The
   results show that the area is mostly affected by shallow but efficient
   convection, probably embedded in major weather systems with high
   precipitation rain rates, which tends to saturate the catchments and
   produce flooding. The work also shows the role of the topography as a
   triggering factor for storms outside the convective season, as a key
   feature for the convergence lines organization, and as a capping for
   stationary cells upstream. Improvements in the current warning system,
   such as different precipitation thresholds considering the time of
   exposure to that rain, as well as a further study are also presented as
   main results. These results can be extrapolated and applied to other
   regions affected by the same kind of heavy precipitation and flash
   floods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of the variation in the hydro-environment
   over the past four decades in Wuhan, China, and discusses its close
   relationship with flash flood events. These flash flood events have
   inundated underground infrastructures and resulted in significant
   economic losses and casualties, which are also discussed in relation to
   various external and internal factors. The external factors are
   predominantly owing to heavy rainstorms resulting from extreme climate
   change. The internal factors predominantly include a decrease in wetland
   areas, changes in topography, and disrepair of drainage systems in urban
   areas. Since the 1970s, lakes in Wuhan have been significantly reduced
   in size (by approximately 40\%). This reduction in wetland area
   decreases the water storage capacity in urban areas, and the frequency
   of large flooding events thus increased from 0.1 event/year to
   approximately 0.2 event/year. Additionally, the disrepair of drainage
   systems in urban areas has reduced their ability to resist flood
   hazards. Changes in topography have also intensified the flood volume
   per unit time, further burdening the drainage systems. In 2016, Wuhan
   suffered from several large flooding events that led to some of the most
   severe economic losses in recorded history. The drainage system at the
   urban center of Wuhan and proposed flood prevention methods are
   discussed in detail in this paper. The sponge city (SPC) concept has
   been attempted in Qingshan District, Wuhan, and its success proved the
   reliability of the theory. A SPC is believed to reduce the impacts of
   future flash floods in China and other developed and developing
   countries. (C) 2020 Tongji University and Tongji University Press.

Abstract = {{The past geomorphic activity of flash floods in the Eastern
   Mediterranean has been poorly understood. Despite the general increase
   in mean annual temperature and decrease in annual precipitation totals,
   intense rainfall during strong cyclogenesis is still expected under a
   changing climate. The aim of this study was to identify past flash flood
   events on the island of Crete (Greece) to (i) create a regional
   chronology of flash floods using dendrogeomorphic dating and (ii)
   describe climate triggers responsible for the most distinct events. The
   sampling of 398 trees and shrubs from eight catchments enabled the
   reconstruction of 76 flash flood events over 43 different years. The
   length of the chronologies ranged from 27 to 125 years, and the most
   distinct events were recorded in the 1993-94, 2000-01, and 2006-07.
   Significant differences (p < 0.00001) in the ages of sampled trees and
   the bark thickness among the catchments resulted in different lengths of
   chronologies and numbers of identified events. Records from selected
   rain gauges were used to identify precipitation patterns associated with
   flash floods. The low propagation velocities of cyclones originating
   south and west of Crete characterised the most distinct flash flood
   events, based on synoptic scale analyses.}},

Title = {{Tree-ring based, regional-scale reconstruction of flash floods in
   Mediterranean mountain torrents}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{189}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In small mountain catchments of the Mediterranean basin, heavy and
   intense rainfalls produce frequent flash floods that can cause economic
   damage and even fatalities in the often densely populated valley areas.
   To reduce future damage of such events, the application of mitigation
   strategies aimed at hydrological control and disaster risk reduction is
   essential. However, to reach this goal, flash flood frequency and
   magnitude need to be characterized in space and time. This task is
   highly challenging in areas where existing records are either lacking,
   short or highly incomplete. In poorly or completely ungauged catchments,
   tree-ring based flash flood reconstruction has proven useful to overcome
   this limitation and is now considered a valuable, alternative approach
   to extend flow records back in time. Tree-ring based reconstructions of
   past flash floods have been employed widely in many different geographic
   contexts worldwide, but were less frequently used in Mediterranean
   torrents, and not at all in Southern Italy so far. Here, we present a
   regional flash flood reconstruction from five poorly gauged mountain
   catchments in Calabria (southern Italy) to reconstruct both the timing
   and the magnitude of five extreme flash flood events of the last 60
   years. We show that the return periods of these events ranged between 5
   and 30 years based on hydraulic (Manning's equation) and hydrological
   (rational formula) approaches. Validation of the reconstructed discharge
   values was done by using direct water depth measurements (obtained from
   a gauging station). Our results suggest that the combination of
   different methods allows a reliable reconstruction of extreme
   hydrological events by easy-to-survey parameters in ungauged torrents of
   Mediterranean environments. We also demonstrate that tree-ring
   approaches have the potential to be applied in ungauged (or poorly
   gauged) Mediterranean mountain catchments as well so as to improve
   records of the frequency and magnitude of past flash flood activity.}},

Title = {{An approximation method for evaluating flash flooding mitigation of
   sponge city strategies - A case study of Central Geelong}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{257}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Urban flooding is a severe problem and a growing development challenge
   for many cities around the world. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
   introduce mitigation measures through managing rainwater to reduce these
   risks. The sponge city system is regarded as an effective mechanism to
   manage rainwater and reduce flooding, as it is capable of promoting
   infiltration and retaining rainwater. However, the main challenge is how
   to efficiently quantify and visualise the flooding mitigation effects of
   a sponge city project with various technical measures. There is also a
   lack of cost analysis of sponge city strategies to reduce risks of a
   large-scale urban project. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate and
   visualise mitigation effects from sponge city strategies on urban
   floods. This paper establishes a rapid and simplified modelling
   framework for assessing the approximate effects of sponge city
   strategies on flooding mitigation through GIS simulation in a real-world
   environment. Various sponge city elements, such as green roofs and
   wetlands, are systematically integrated in a rainfall-runoff model.
   Central Geelong will be used as a case study. Scenarios are created in
   terms of project expenditure, green benefit and infiltration. With the
   GIS mapping technologies and MATLAB-based digital image processing, maps
   presenting results for the proposed scenarios are displayed to visualise
   the mitigation effects of the strategies on urban flooding inundation.
   The results reveal that the sponge city strategies are capable of
   generating varying degrees of mitigation of urban flash floods. The
   scenario with the largest infiltration volume has shown the most
   significant effect on the flooding mitigation, such as a reduction of
   80\% in the runoff volume during a one-in-50-year rainfall event, but it
   may cost twice as much as other options. Overall, this study could be
   applied to rapid assessment measures of sponge city strategies in the
   flooding control and decision making on urban green infrastructure
   planning. The approach proposed here could be adopted for disaster
   mitigation though sponge city technologies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The increase of intensive anthropopression since the Middle Ages has
   been recorded in numerous anthropogenic forms (embankments, dumps,
   canals, pits, etc.) and sediments (changes of sedimentation type, buried
   soils, slags, charcoals, geochemical changes) of the valleys of the Holy
   Cross Mountains. The development of small-scale water retention systems
   associated with functioning forges and mills on the watercourses
   resulted in changes in river patterns (anthropogenic anastomoses) and
   the reduction of the flood stage maximum during the Little Ice Age (on
   the Kamionka River). In the twentieth century, after the disappearance
   of the small-scale retention system caused by economic changes on the
   Kamionka and Czarna Konecka rivers, hydrotechnical failures appeared
   that led to the formation of catastrophic flash floods previously
   unknown during the Holocene. The geomorphological effects of these
   floods exceeded by many times the effects of secular processes. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{High-resolution daily precipitation estimation is very important in
   climatological and meteorological studies in the arid regions of the
   world, as precipitation events in these areas can be sporadic, localized
   and of very high intensity. In this study, the daily performance of
   five, ARC2, CHIRPS v2.0, GSMaP (v. 6), TAMSAT (v. 3) and PERSIANN-CCS
   high resolution satellite-based gauge-corrected precipitation products
   were compared, and the individual performances validated against rain
   gauge station records in the arid region of Egypt. Seven statistical
   metrics (three continuous and four categorical), and selected intensity
   categories, were employed in the modelling of rainfall totals for the
   2003 to 2018 period. In general, the results indicated poor outcomes for
   all the satellite-based products. CHIRPS was best at estimating rainfall
   of < 1 mm/day; this represented 30\% of wet days during the study
   period. ARC and GSMaP performed better in estimating rainfall events
   with an intensity category of >= 1 mm/day, however both produced a high
   number of false detections. Despite continuous improvement of TAMSAT, it
   recorded the worst performance among the products evaluated. The study
   concluded that GSMaP appeared to be the ``best{''} to use for supporting
   research activities over the arid Egyptian domain given its performance
   relative to the other satellite-based precipitation products.}},

Title = {{Global rheophytes data set: angiosperms and gymnosperms}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{The term rheophyte describes a biological group of flood-tolerant plants
   that are confined to the beds of swift-running streams and rivers in
   nature and grow up to flood level, but not beyond the reach of regularly
   occurring flash floods. Although over 35 yr have passed since the first
   global census of rheophytes, no updates have been recorded regarding the
   number of taxa in this biological group in seed plants. Therefore, the
   present work aimed to (1) review the main topics associated with
   rheophytism (e.g., morphological characteristics, genetic studies,
   geographic distribution, conservation, and evolutionary aspects); (2)
   provide an updated checklist of rheophytes distributed around the world
   considering the two main groups in seed plants (gymnosperms and
   angiosperms); (3) demonstrate the distribution of rheophytism in the
   angiosperm phylogeny; and (4) estimate the geographical distribution and
   richness of selected taxa on the world map for the first time. All data
   compiled for the present study originated from a search of peer-reviewed
   articles, secondary literature (theses, dissertations, reports, books,
   and floras), and electronic facilities. We compiled a data set composed
   of four taxa in gymnosperms (Podocarpaceae family) and 1,368 taxa
   (including obligate, facultative, and unclassified rheophytes)
   distributed in 114 families and 508 genera in angiosperms. Most of the
   studied taxa belong to eudicotyledons (72.81\%), while 1.46\% belong to
   magnoliids, and 25.73\% belong to monocotyledons. The families with the
   highest number of taxa in descending order are Podostemaceae, Araceae,
   Myrtaceae, Rubiaceae, Asteraceae, Apocynaceae, Arecaceae, Fabaceae,
   Phyllanthaceae, and Poaceae. Of the 114 families plotted in angiosperm
   phylogeny, at least 80 harbor obligate rheophytes. The geographical
   distribution of rheophytes in angiosperms, as expected based on the
   first census of this biological group, is mainly in the tropical and
   subtropical regions. The high richness of rheophytic taxa was mostly
   found in southern Mexico, southern China, Borneo, and northern and
   eastern Australia. In contrast, the geographical distribution of
   rheophytes in gymnosperms is restricted to New Caledonia and Tasmania.
   The present study will help to advance knowledge regarding the diversity
   of rheophytes in angiosperms and gymnosperms while drawing attention to
   this biological group, which has often been overlooked. There are no
   copyright restrictions. Please cite this data paper when the data are
   used in publications and teaching events.}},

Abstract = {{Floods due to heavy rainfall are one of the most frequent and widespread
   natural hazards. Rainfall is one of the key variables in flood modeling.
   For topographically steep catchments, flood modeling requires accurate
   rainfall sources in both time and space. The objective of this study is
   to compare different rainfall sources in physics-based distributed
   hydrologic model, (Weather Research and Forecasting) WRF-Hydro, in a
   data-scarce, small and topographically steep catchment. For this
   purpose, the model was calibrated and validated for the three
   catastrophic flood events that occurred in the Terme basin of eastern
   Black Sea region in Samsun, Turkey. The rainfall datasets include
   weather radar data and the Hydro-Estimator satellite rainfall product as
   nowcasting products, and WRF model precipitation data as a forecasting
   product and gauge-based data. Our results indicated that the tested
   rainfall products have different limitations and potentials depending on
   the rainfall process, so the accuracy of the results is greatly affected
   by the accuracy of rainfall products. Among the flood hydrographs, WRF
   precipitation data, bias-adjusted radar data and gauge data gave best
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) results with calibrated parameters in
   simulations belonging to floods observed on November 22, 2014, August 2,
   2015, and May, 28, 2016, respectively.}},

Title = {{Assessment of flash flood risk based on improved analytic hierarchy
   process method and integrated maximum likelihood clustering algorithm}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{584}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters throughout the
   world, and are responsible for sizeable social and economic losses, as
   well as countless injuries and death. Risk assessment, which identifies
   areas susceptible to flooding, has been shown to be an effective tool
   for managing and mitigating flash floods. The study aims to introduce
   the methods to determine the weights of the risk indices, and identify
   the different risk clusters. In this regard, we proposed a methodology
   for comprehensively assessing flash flood risk in a GIS environment, by
   the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) method, and an
   integration of iterative self-organizing data (ISODATA) analysis and
   maximum likelihood (ISO-Maximum) clustering algorithm. The weight for
   each risk index is determined by the IAHP, which integrates the
   subjective characteristics with objective attributes of the assessment
   data. Based on the data mining technology, the integration of
   ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm derives a more reasonable
   classification. The Guangdong Province of China was selected for testing
   the proposed method's applicability, and we used a receiver operating
   characteristics (ROC) curve approach to validate the modeling of the
   flash-flood risk distribution. The validation against the historical
   flash flood data indicates a high reliability of this method for
   comprehensive flash flood risk assessment. In order to verify the
   proposed method's superiority, in addition, the technique for order
   performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the
   weights-of-evidence (WE) methods are used for comparison with the IAHP
   and ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm method. Moreover, we analyzed and
   compared the regularity of flash floods in the rural and urban areas.
   This study not only provides a new approach for large-scale flash flood
   comprehensive risk assessment, but also assists researchers and local
   decision-makers in designing flash flood mitigation strategies.}},

   historical data of flood events recorded in Kuala Lumpur. Data of
   rainfall characteristics, inundated location, and areas are extracted
   from the reports of flood events from the year 2005-2015. Each event is
   then segregated according to the place of incidence, providing
   point-based recurrence of flood at each identified location. Indicators
   of assessment include frequency and month of occurrence, rainfall
   characteristics (of intensity, duration, and depth), and land use
   categories. A total of 137 (point) locations have been identified, where
   each location is colour-coded based on a 5-point rating scale. The
   point-based flood-prone locations are validated with the watershed based
   of 50-ARI rainfall modelling, providing comprehensive hotspot maps.
   Developed interactive colour-coded flood prone maps facilitate relevant

   piedmont, were selected for a comparison of the land-use impact on the
   morphology and sedimentology of their stream channels. Each pair
   experienced similar annual rainfall and comprised similar metamorphic
   bedrock, steep topography, and brown soils; the members of each pair
   contrast with respect to their land-use structure as they comprise large
   forest cover (forest > 90\%) and a significant contribution of
   agricultural land with tea plantations (forest < 63\%), respectively. A
   set of rainfall, cross-sectional, and sediment data were collected for
   the characterization of the stream channels. The obtained results
   revealed that, under extreme rainfall and high denudation rates as well
   as frequent flash floods, the geomorphic response to land-use changes
   involving agricultural expansion at the expense of forest cover was less
   pronounced in the mountain channels than in the piedmont. Significant
   differences between the studied pairs of mountain streams draining
   forested and agricultural catchments were observed only at bankfull
   width and baseflow depth in fourth-order streams and baseflow depth in
   fifth-order streams. Local environmental factors such as bedrock channel
   boundaries, steep topography, high material supply to river networks,
   and selective sediment mobilization during extreme rainfall and floods
   override the effects of land use and exert dominant control over stream
   channels in mountain catchments. However, the effects of agricultural
   activity in mountains are propagated downstream. In the agricultural
   catchment in the piedmont, a local rapid decrease in river slope and an
   increase in water infiltration into alluvia facilitates the deposition
   of eroded material. In addition, the stream in the agricultural
   catchment exhibited a rise in the riverbed with the expansion of a
   braided channel over a dozen kilometers below the Himalayan front in the
   piedmont, while the streams in the forested catchment revealed a
   distinct tendency towards incision. The present-day channel morphologies
   and sediment patterns observed in forested catchments are most likely
   similar to those that existed in the studied rivers prior to the
   development of tea plantations and settlements in the mid-19th century.}},

Title = {{Mapping rainstorm erosion associated with an individual storm from InSAR
   coherence loss validated by field evidence for the Atacama Desert}},
Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS}},
Abstract = {{Extreme high-magnitude and low-frequency storm events in arid zones
   provide the necessary runoff to entrain sediments from source areas and
   therefore dictate the linkages between hillslopes and channels.
   Nevertheless, the erosive impact of large storms remains difficult to
   predict. Most of the uncertainty lies in the lack of topographic change
   maps associated with single hydro-meteorological events. Consequently,
   event-based erosion models are poorly constrained and their
   extrapolation over long time periods remains uncertain. In this study, a
   15-month Sentinel-1A coherence time series, optical and field data are
   used to map the spatial patterns of erosion after the 5-day storm
   occurred on March 2015, in the Atacama Desert. The coherence change
   detection (CCD) analysis suggests that temporal loss of coherence is
   related to variations in soil moisture, while permanent loss of
   coherence is related to modification of soil texture by erosion and
   sedimentation. Importantly, permanent loss of coherence is more apparent
   on gentle rather than steeper slopes, likely reflecting differences in
   regolith cover and thickness. These findings can contradict the
   landscape models predicting higher erosion on steeper hillslopes. The
   CCD technique represents a promising tool for analysing and modelling
   sediment connectivity in arid areas, giving a clear picture of the
   relation between sediment sources and sink pathways. (c) 2020 John Wiley

Title = {{Drivers of variability in large wood loads along the fluvial continuum
   of a Mediterranean intermittent river}},
Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS}},
Abstract = {{Although in-channel and floodplain large wood (LW) has been recognized
   as an important component of lotic ecosystems, there is still limited
   knowledge on the recruitment, mobility and retention of LW in rivers
   with an intermittent hydrological regime. In this study, we analysed the
   LW characteristics and related reach-scale variables of 22 reaches in a
   Mediterranean intermittent river (Evrotas, Greece) in order to identify
   predictors of in-channel and floodplain LW distribution. Our results
   indicated high downstream variation in LW volumes in the fluvial
   corridor (0.05-25.51 m(3)/ha for in-channel LW and 0-30.88 m(3)/ha for
   floodplain LW). In-channel and floodplain LW retention was primarily
   driven by the hydrological regime of the studied reaches (i.e. perennial
   or non-perennial) with higher volumes of LW observed in perennial
   sections. The width of the riparian corridor was an important predictor
   of LW storage at the reach scale. Non-perennial reaches had a
   disproportionally larger number of relatively small-diameter living
   trees at the expense of mature trees with larger diameters typical for
   riparian stands functioning as LW recruitment areas in perennial
   reaches. The smaller dimensions of in-channel LW in non-perennial
   reaches, coupled with the dominance of loose LW pieces, implies frequent
   LW transport during ordinary flood events. Nevertheless, overall low LW
   retention in the fluvial corridor under non-perennial flow regime
   predicts low volumes of mobilized LW. In contrast, the recruitment of
   relatively long and large-diameter LW from mature riparian stands in
   perennial reaches, together with additional LW stabilization by banks,
   bed sediments, living trees or other LW pieces decreases the potential
   for further LW transport. (c) 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Urban flood inundation and damage assessment based on numerical
   simulations of design rainstorms with different characteristics}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Abstract = {{In the context of global climate change and urbanization, urban flooding
   is an important type of natural disaster that affects urban development,
   especially in China, which is experiencing rapid urbanization. In the
   past 10 years, urban flooding events have caused huge disaster losses in
   Chinese cities. This has resulted in significant negative effects on the
   urban infrastructure, socioeconomic systems, and urban residents, thus
   causing widespread concern. Studies have confirmed the change in extreme
   rainstorms is due to the changing environments in many cities globally
   Conducting studies on the impact of these rainstorms with different
   characteristics for urban flooding is valuable for coping with
   unfavorable situations In addition, numerical simulations provide an
   economical and viable means to perform these studies. This paper
   presents a numerical model of Xiamen Island in China. Simulations were
   conducted for 12 design rainstorm events with different return periods,
   rain patterns, and durations. The results indicate that, in the case of
   an equal rainfall amount, the rainfall intensity is the key factor that
   affects the inundated area, depth, and damages. However, the rainfall
   intensity is not the only determining factor; the rainfall pattern also
   affects the inundations. In regard to the rainfall pattern, a higher
   rainfall peak coefficient usually leads to severe urban inundation and
   damage. As a result, the lag time would be shorter, which may further
   exacerbate the impact of urban flood disasters. The results of this
   study provide insights into managing flood risks, developing urban flood
   prevention strategies, and designing flood prevention measures.}},

Title = {{Analysis of the observed trends in daily extreme precipitation indices
   in Gaza Strip during 1974-2016}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{There is a high-risk attendant on the changes in precipitation in
   developing countries, for example, Gaza Strip (GS). These changes have
   far-reaching social and economic ramifications by causing devastating
   flash floods and droughts. Based on the daily precipitation observations
   of eight meteorological stations over GS, from 1974 to 2016, the trends
   of 11 extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) were estimated using linear
   least squares method and then assessed statistically by Mann-Kendall
   test. The results show that, on average, most of the indices exhibited
   increasing trends during 1974-2016. It includes total wet-day
   precipitation (PRCPTOT), simple daily intensity index (SDII), and max
   1-day precipitation (RX1day). Others were the max 5-day precipitation
   (RX5day), very wet day precipitation (R95p), extremely wet day
   precipitation (R99p), number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm), number
   of very heavy precipitation days (R20mm), and the number of consecutive
   dry days (CDD). Three of these indices passed the significance test
   (with p < .05): RX1day, RX5day, and R95p. Other EPIs, including number
   of wet days (R1mm) and consecutive wet days (CWD), exhibited
   non-significant decreasing trends. Spatially, many stations over GS
   exhibited opposite trends, especially in R1mm and CDD; however, they are
   separated by a few kilometres. Moreover, all EPIs have significant
   positive correlations with PRCPTOT at the 99\% confidence level, except
   CDD (trend was non-significant). The contribution of extreme
   precipitation to annual PRCPTOT exhibited an increasing trend, which was
   significant at 62\% of GS stations. The study indicates a potential
   increase in summer (drought) season.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interdisciplinary archaeological and paleoenvironmental research
   in the Arabian peninsula is transforming our understanding of ancient
   human societies in their ecological contexts. Hypotheses about the
   cultural and demographic impacts of a series of droughts have primarily
   been developed from the environmental and archaeological records of
   southeastern Arabia. Here we examine these human-environment
   interactions by integrating ongoing research from northern Arabia. While
   droughts and extreme environmental variability in the Holocene had
   significant impacts on human societies, responses varied across space
   and time and included mobility at various scales, as well as diverse
   social, economic and cultural adaptations, such as the management
   ofwater resources, the introduction of pastoral lifeways, and the
   construction of diverse types of stone structures. The long-term story
   of human societies in Arabia is one of resilience in the face of climate
   change, yet future challenges include rising temperatures and flash
   flooding. The history of human responses to climatic and ecosystem
   changes in Arabia can provide important lessons for a planet facing
   catastrophic global warming and environmental change.}},

Title = {{Flash floods versus river floods - a comparison of psychological impacts
   and implications for precautionary behaviour}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{999-1023}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{River floods are among the most damaging natural hazards that frequently
   occur in Germany. Flooding causes high economic losses and impacts many
   residents. In 2016, several southern German municipalities were hit by
   flash floods after unexpectedly severe heavy rainfall, while in 2013
   widespread river flooding had occurred. This study investigates and
   compares the psychological impacts of river floods and flash floods and
   potential consequences for precautionary behaviour. Data were collected
   using computer-aided telephone interviews that were conducted among
   flood-affected households around 9 months after each damaging event.
   This study applies Bayesian statistics and negative binomial regressions
   to test the suitability of psychological indicators to predict the
   precaution motivation of individuals. The results show that it is not
   the particular flood type but rather the severity and local impacts of
   the event that are crucial for the different, and potentially negative,
   impacts on mental health. According to the used data, however,
   predictions of the individual precaution motivation should not be based
   on the derived psychological indicators - i.e. coping appraisal, threat
   appraisal, burden and evasion - since their explanatory power was
   generally low and results are, for the most part, non-significant. Only
   burden reveals a significant positive relation to planned precaution
   regarding weak flash floods. In contrast to weak flash floods and river

Abstract = {{Rice is one of most important crops in the world and is also the most
   advanced crop for breeding among cereal crops. Generally, rice is grown
   in lowland and flood-prone areas due to its ability to survive in
   semiaquatic environments. To adapt to excess water conditions, rice has
   developed specialized anatomical and morphological traits such as
   aerenchyma, radial oxygen loss barriers, adventitious roots, and leaf
   gas film formation ability. However, these strategies are insufficient
   for survival under continuous complete submergence, which leads to death
   due to oxygen starvation. To overcome prolonged submergence, some Asian
   rice varieties have further developed additional traits such as aerobic
   germination, quiescence of leaf elongation in response to flash floods,
   and internode elongation under periodic flooding. In this review, we
   describe recent progress in the understanding of the various molecular
   mechanisms and genetic factors regulating flooding tolerance in rice.}},

Title = {{Catchment-scale multi-process modeling with local time stepping}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Numerical modeling is an important tool for prediction, analysis and
   understanding of the dynamics of land surface processes. To increase the
   usage and impact of such tools, it is crucial to decrease runtime by
   increasing computational efficiency. Dynamic processes such as water
   flow are typically described by higher-order differential equations.
   Solving these accurately requires numerical integration over time, where
   numerical errors depend on the time steps taken. Typically, flow
   simulation use the smallest required time steps in a model's domain to
   simulate flow. In this paper, we analyze the usage of local time
   stepping, for catchment-scale simulation of land surface processes such
   as water flow, infiltration, slope stability and landslide runout. In
   such a scheme, temporal integration is cell specific, allowing for
   higher numerical efficiency. The implemented scheme works with fully
   free local time steps that are synchronized only for visualization. We
   implement this method in a monotonic upwind scheme for conservation laws
   (MUSCL). We investigate the influence on stability and the resulting
   changes in computation time and accuracy in a hydrology-coupled,
   catchment-scale flood simulation. Results show that local time stepping
   can be implemented in a total variation diminishing (TVD) numerical
   scheme that is second-order spatially accurate. Simulation results in
   both 1D dam-break scenarios and catchment-scale flash flood scenarios
   show insignificant changes in modeling result, while computation time
   reduces with over 50\%. Finally, the method is successfully implemented
   in a multi-process lands surface model with hydrology, flooding, slope
   failure, and runout. The implementation of a local time stepping for
   computation of dynamic land surface processes could be implemented
   widely for increased computational efficiency without significant loss
   of accuracy.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS}},
Abstract = {{Pakistan has faced frequent flash and riverine flooding in the recent
   decades. This study evaluates the effectiveness of flood EWS from the
   perspectives of local experts/institutions and communities. Interviews
   and consultations with the local experts (13 officials from government
   and other concerned departments) were carried out to understand the
   institutional challenges in communicating early warnings, whereas three
   flood-prone communities from different-sized cities (Rawalpindi, Sialkot
   and Muzaffargarh) were surveyed. A total of 210 samples were collected
   through household questionnaire surveys to assess their understanding of
   the local warning system. The analysis revealed that almost half of the
   community respondents did not receive a warning last time when the flood
   occurred. Variations were also observed regarding the main source of
   early warning in the three communities. This study identifies
   institutional challenges, such as lack of (1) resources to keep an EWS
   equipment operational; (2) community trust; and (3) proper guidelines to
   communicate warnings. The study calls for an immediate revision of
   strategies to communicate early warnings to the end-users and to
   incorporate their feedback in designing/redesigning the early warning
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Taking into account the exponential growth of the number of flash-floods
   events worldwide, the detection of areas prone to these natural hazards
   is one of the main activities taken in order to mitigate the negative
   effects of these risk phenomena. In the present paper, new modeling
   approaches, Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) integrated with IOE
   (ADT-IOE) and ADT integrated with AHP (ADT-AHP), were proposed for
   flash-flood susceptibility mapping across the Suha river catchment
   (Romania). Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and
   Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this
   regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8
   flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training
   process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was
   checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA),
   and Kappa index. The result shows that the two ensemble models, the
   ADT-IOE (AUC = 0.972, CLC = 86.37\%, Kappa statistics = 0.727) and the
   ADT-AHP (AUC = 0.926, CLA = 87.88\%, Kappa statistics = 0.758), have
   high prediction performance and outperform the other models. Therefore,
   ADT-IOE and ADT-AHP are new and promising tools for flash-flood
   susceptibility modeling. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   study of a flash flood in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on the November 25, 2009}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a convective system, which brought heavy rainfall
   leading towards a flash flood on November 25, 2009, over Jeddah city and
   its surrounding regions. Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced
   Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) based near-real-time MSG-RGB
   (red, green, blue) composites and cloud top temperature images are used
   for the assessment of convection stages during the event. Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data is used to quantify the rainfall
   amount and found reliable as compared with ground observations. Air mass
   RGB serves as an effective tool for the visual enhancement of
   cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds as well as differentiating them from other
   local features. Cloud top temperatures obtained from MSG IR10.8 channel
   show that the threshold values of cloud top below 220 degrees K can lead
   to rainfall with the intensity of 10 mm/hr or above over Jeddah region.
   The results from MSG-SEVIRI and TRMM satellite data show that satellite
   data could serve as an effective tool for the near real-time monitoring
   of the rainfall event, when analysing convection stages. The study
   suggests that where ground measurements are minimal, satellite
   information can be used in as part of a flood warning system to minimise
   the aftermaths of a flood disaster.}},

Title = {{Bayesian lifetime analysis for landslide dams}},
Journal = {{LANDSLIDES}},
Abstract = {{Landslide dams are a common hazard which threaten downstream human
   settlement or infrastructure, as their collapse may result in a flash
   flood. The danger is compounded by the amount of water accumulated;
   therefore, estimation of the time to failure becomes crucial for
   assessing engineering risk mitigation procedures. Dam dimension indices,
   descriptive multivariate analysis and logistic regression have been used
   to produce a static image of the dam conditions, estimating the
   probability of failure, but they provide no information of when a
   failure might occur. We propose a Bayesian model to predict the time to
   failure of landslide dams, based on imputing missing dam and reservoir
   measurements via an analysis of their covariate structure. The resulting
   data is then used in a Bayesian survival model which links the
   (censored) failure time to dam and reservoir variables. A case study on
   heterogeneous Italian events is presented, on which our model is tested.
   Results show that it is possible to produce a probabilistic model of
   time to failure. The length and height of dams, and the catchment area
   behind them, are identified as the most important covariates controlling
   the time to failure. The addition of area-based intercepts confirms the
   robustness of the methodology. Examples of potential results
   (forecasting) and possible generalizations of the model are presented.}},

   challenge of data scarcity. By utilizing the physiographic features of
   the study basin, it could be deduced that the hydrological behavior has
   influenced by the geomorphological and the topographical aspects. This
   study was based on the integral coordination among physical properties
   of the study basin, geo-informatics and Watershed Modeling System (WMS)
   to create the hydrograph of Wadi El-Deeb and its study sub-catchments.
   Flash flood hazard of the study sub-catchments which are located in
   Egypt have been evaluated and classified into low hazard group
   (sub-basin 2) and high hazard group (sub-basins 1, 3 and 4). The
   groundwater recharge potentiality may increase at the sub-basin 2 and
   the surface runoff will be expected for sub-basins 1, 3 and 4.
   Therefore; some obstruction dams should be created at the fourth and
   fifth order of the high hazard sub-basins. The maximum volume capacity
   of the whole Wadi El-Deeb is about 781.6 x 10(6) m(3) which covered a
   flooded area is about 62 km(2), while for the study sub-basins the
   maximum flooded area ranges from 0.3 km to 17.2 km(2) and the volume
   capacity ranges from 1.5 x 10(6) m(3) to 125.7 x 10(6) m(3). On the
   other hand, the geoelectrical study and the data of the hand dug wells,
   revealed the presence of two water bearing formations of Wadi deposits
   and weathered basement rocks. The groundwater potentiality is limited
   and it can be used only for Bedouin, cheeps and camels drinking through
   small desalination units working with solar energy. The geophysical
   exploration results of shallow groundwater are matching with the
   constructed hazard degree map.}},

Title = {{Reliability check of flash-flood in Central Bohemia on May 25, 1872}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The flash flood occurring on May 25, 1872 ranks among the most extreme
   events recorded within the Czech Republic. The causative torrential rain
   affected mostly the area between Karlovy Vary, Plzen and Prague of
   approximately 2000 km(2). A corresponding intensity of precipitation
   observed incidentally at two sites exceeded 200 mm in 3-8 h. The
   consequent flood caused tremendous damages to ponds, houses, and
   infrastructure and resulted in a temporary collapse of transport
   especially due to a total break of trains operation. The flood led to
   approximately 240-300 fatalities according to various sources. An extent
   of the total area affected reached approximately 2000-3000 km(2)
   representing an unusually large scale for such a type of flood. The
   intensive rain and inflow caused the biggest rupture of a water
   reservoir in Mladotice so far. The respective Mladoticky pond held very
   likely 3-4 million cubic meters of water before its rupture. With a
   delay of 2 to 3 days, a substantial saturation triggered a massive
   landslide blocking the Mladoticky7 water stream and creating a new water
   body named the Odlezelske Lake.
   The flood event motivated elaboration of at least 3 scholarly papers
   already between 1872 and 1875. Accordingly, this flood presents for
   Czech hydrologists an outstanding example of such an extreme magnitude
   until now. The flood in 1872 and drought in 1874 led directly to
   establishing the Hydrological service of the Czech Kingdoms in 1875.
   Hitherto, we have no comparison for such extreme flood including recent
   floods occurring in 2002, 2010 and 2013. The flood peaks exceeded other
   historical or recent floods by at least 1-2 m. There is only one similar
   flood event, the flood of July 31, 1714 at the Skava River catchment.
   As there were no regular hydrological observations including
   precipitation measurements available for the affected areas before 1883,
   the prevailing data source comprise documentary sources and their
   relevant interpretations. The aim of our study is to explain in a more
   detail the course of this flood and a number of indeterminate
   circumstances during the flood. An important question was an effect of
   the collapse of approximately 100 ponds and a role of the collapsed
   sizeable Mladoticky pond. These phenomena were partly explained by
   newspapers and chronicles describing an incredibly rapid increase of
   water level (2-3 m in a few minutes) at a relatively large number of
   sites. We have completed a hydraulic estimation of peak discharges at
   major profiles. In our research we used the Aqualog hydrological
   modelling system. The hydrological modelling enabled us to complete and
   check the reliability of observed causative precipitation for the
   affected area and peak flow rates at the Beroun and Prague
   municipalities. An important point was the reconstruction of a flow
   hydrograph at Prague with very intricate shape and two likely local
   peaks. Second local maximum could be attributed to the collapse of the
   Mladoticky pond. This flood is of crucial importance for the Prague
   flood protection system. The main reason being a short time span of 22 h
   between the beginning of causative rainfall and occurrence of maximum
   flood flow rate at Prague.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the catastrophic flash flood event which occurred in the
   western part of Attica (Greece) in November 2017 is reconstructed. The
   flood event hit the town of Mandra, causing 24 fatalities and huge
   damages in the properties and the infrastructure. The flood hydrograph
   was derived using the two-dimensional hydrodynamic model FLOW-R2D.
   Attention was drawn on the uncertainties of the model output due to the
   uncertainty of the estimated parameters such as infiltration, friction
   and the uncertainty of input data. Due to the computational burden
   related to the model, a global sensitivity analysis based on Morris
   method was performed. Then, a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty analysis was
   performed on the two most influential factors. It was concluded that
   even the results of the physically based hydrodynamic models are
   characterised by uncertainties. However, the capability of the
   hydrodynamic models to describe in detail the dynamics of the overland
   flow is the main advantage of these models against the conventional
   hydrological models. It is concluded that the rational use of physically
   based models for analysing complex storm phenomena with high variable
   spatial and temporal distribution can lead to a more accurate range of
   magnitudes of flood peak.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose a robust water level sensor based on a fiber
   Bragg grating (FBG). The sensor head is formed by a cylindrical PVC cap
   with 4 cm diameter. The cap was filled with silicone rubber in which two
   FBGs were inserted for temperature and strain measurements. The cap was
   placed on the top of a protective PVC pipe column, and a 2 m long float
   was inserted into its center. Under the action of buoyancy, the float
   causes a compressive stress in the silicone rubber, which results in a
   longitudinal strain in the fiber. The sensor was tested with the FBG
   embedded at 5 mm, 10 mm and 15 mm in the silicone rubber, and the
   obtained sensitivitieswere 155.7 +/- 2.4 pm/m, 80.7 +/- 1.2 pm/m and
   43.5 +/- 2.5 pm/m, respectively. Considering the maximum wavelength
   shift observed was 0.72 nm, the expected maximum water heights the
   sensor could detected are about 5 m, 10 m and 18 m, for the three
   silicone rubber depths considered. It was also developed a theoretical
   model to describe the sensor response with the silicone rubber depth and
   water height.}},

Abstract = {{Western North America preserves iconic dinosaur faunas from the Upper
   Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous, but this record is interrupted by an
   approximately 20 Myr gap with essentially no terrestrial vertebrate
   fossil localities. This poorly sampled interval is nonetheless important
   because it is thought to include a possible mass extinction, the origin
   of orogenic controls on dinosaur spatial distribution, and the origin of
   important Upper Cretaceous dinosaur taxa. Therefore, dinosaurbearing
   rocks from this interval are of particular interest to vertebrate
   palaeontologists. In this study, we report on one such locality from
   Highwood Pass, Alberta. This locality has yielded a multitaxic
   assemblage, with the most diagnostic material identified so far
   including ankylosaurian osteoderms and a turtle plastron element. The
   fossil horizon lies within the upper part of the Pocaterra Creek Member
   of the Cadomin Formation (Blairmore Group). The fossils are assigned as
   Berriasian (earliest Cretaceous) in age, based on previous palynomorph
   analyses of the Pocaterra Creek Member and underlying and overlying
   strata. The fossils lie within numerous cross-bedded sandstone beds
   separated by pebble lenses. These sediments are indicative of a
   relatively high-energy depositional environment, and the distribution of
   these fossils over multiple beds indicates that they accumulated over
   multiple events, possibly flash floods. The fossils exhibit a range of
   surface weathering, having intact to heavily weathered cortices. The
   presence of definitive dinosaur material from near the
   Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary of Alberta establishes the oldest record of
   dinosaur body fossils in western Canada and provides a unique
   opportunity to study the Early Cretaceous dinosaur faunas of western
   North America.}},

Title = {{Probabilistic high-impact rainfall forecasts from landfalling tropical
   cyclones using Warn-on-Forecast system}},
Journal = {{QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{Intense rainfall and flash flooding from landfalling tropical cyclones
   (LTC) can have devastating impacts on human life and property in coastal
   areas. The years 2017 and 2018 are examples of how the North Atlantic
   LTCs can create widespread destruction in the United States. Better
   preparedness is needed to mitigate the impact from the violent LTCs and
   can be achieved by improving the accuracy of forecasts and increased
   lead-time of guidance products. However, predicting the fine-scale
   details of rain bands in LTC is very challenging. This study attempts to
   elucidate the potential of National Severe Storms Laboratory's
   convective-scale ensemble analysis and prediction system, known as the
   Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS), in improving 0-6 hr probabilistic
   intense rainfall forecasts from three recent LTCs in the United States.
   Results indicate that the frequent 15 min assimilation cycling can
   accurately analyse the small-scale details from the LTC rain bands in
   the WoFS analyses. The WoFS 0-6 hr ensemble forecasts initialized from
   those analyses represent the location, intensity and spatial
   distribution of intense rainfall (with the potential to cause flash
   flooding) as well as low-level rotation with reasonably good accuracy.
   The continuous flow of the frequently updated WoFS rainfall guidance has
   the potential to aid operational forecasters in issuing watches,
   warnings, and short-term forecast products of life-threatening LTC with
   higher spatial and temporal specificity.}},

Abstract = {{A case of severe flash flood event affecting Kota Kinabalu (KK) on 17
   Jul 2005 is analyzed by means of synoptic analysis using ERA-Interim
   Reanalysis and NCEP-FNL Data sets. In the synoptic scale, significant
   amount of precipitation was recorded in Sabah on 16 Jul and 17 Jul 2005.
   The heavy rainfall was associated to the upper-level ridge and
   lower-level cyclone observed over the South China Sea. Several
   low-pressure centers were also noticed over the Philippines Sea which
   were believed to intensify the heavy rainfall in Sabah. The vertical
   cross section for divergence along 116 degrees E at Kota Kinabalu also
   revealed that a significant convergence was observed near the surface
   and accompanied by a strong updraft of divergence at upper-level. In the
   mesoscale, the ability of the convection-permitting WRF model to
   reproduce the convective cells associated with the heavy rainfall event
   is examined. A triply nested WRF model with the highest resolution of
   5-km horizontal grid spacing was integrated with conventional analysis
   data. The simulation results were validated against observation from
   TRMM, CHIRPS, and PERSIANN-CDR. The modelled results agree moderately to
   the observation and fairly well simulated the initiation,
   intensification, and deceleration of heavy rainfall at nearly the right
   time except for some mismatch in terms of spatial distribution. The
   corresponding precipitation amount was also reasonably reproduced in its
   distribution but slightly overestimated. We also found that the cause of
   this severe flash flood is rooted to the prolonged heavy rainfall in the
   KK region induced by Typhoon Haitang.}},

Title = {{Integration of landslide hazard into urban planning across Europe}},
Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{196}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{An enquiry-based and participatory analysis approach is carried out to
   identify the strengths and weaknesses in the heterogeneous legislations
   across Europe that regulate the integration of landslide hazard into
   urban planning. Twenty one national and eight regional Geological
   Surveys (GSs) have participated in the analysis. The GSs report almost
   4000 recent (2015-2017) damaging landslides events resulting in 39
   fatalities and 155 injuries, destruction to housing, infrastructure and
   properties. In addition, 11 countries report 18 MORLE events over the
   past 10 years responsible for 150 fatalities and severe economic
   impacts. Results also reveal almost 48 million people living in areas
   with high and very high degrees of landslide-susceptibility (around 1
   million km(2) according to ELSUS v2). This work shows that almost half
   the participating countries (10 countries) have no legal guidance in the
   National Land Bill to stipulate consideration of landslides in urban
   planning practices, and mapping tools are often not adapted to a
   standard required to inform sustainable development. Furthermore, there
   is a wide range of laws and a large heterogeneity of mapping methods,
   scales and procedures. A relevant deficiency detected in many countries
   is the lack of landslide maps at a detailed resolution for urban
   planning. Additionally, some case studies of suboptimal urban
   development practices in areas of known instability have been discussed;
   they are found to be related to weak rule of law and/or absence of good
   governance. This paper shows inconsistencies across Europe in the
   handling of landslides and proposes a series of key actions to improve
   this situation, highlighting the need for a common regulatory framework
   to deal with this geohazard appropriately.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is carried out in the context of the continuous
   increase, worldwide, of the number of flash-floods phenomena. Also,
   there is an evident increase of the size of the damages caused by these
   hazards. Basca Chiojdului River Basin is one of the most affected areas
   in Romania by flash-flood phenomena. Therefore, Flash-Flood Potential
   Index (FFPI) was defined and calculated across the Basca Chiojdului
   river basin by using one bivariate statistical method (Statistical
   Index) and its novel ensemble with the following machine learning
   models: Logistic Regression, Classification and Regression Trees,
   Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine and
   Decision Tree CART. In a first stage, the areas with torrentiality were
   digitized based on orthophotomaps and field observations. These regions,
   together with an equal number of non-torrential pixels, were further
   divided into training surfaces (70\%) and validating surfaces (30\%).
   The next step of the analysis consisted of the selection of flash-flood
   conditioning factors based on the multicollinearity investigation and
   predictive ability estimation through Information Gain method. Eight
   factors, from a total of ten flash-floods predictors, were selected in
   order to be included in the FFPI calculation process. By applying the
   models represented by Statistical Index and its ensemble with the
   machine learning algorithms, the weight of each conditioning factor and
   of each factor class/category in the FFPI equations was established.
   Once the weight values were derived, the FFPI values across the Basca
   Chiojdului river basin were calculated by overlaying the flash-flood
   predictors in GIS environment. According to the results obtained, the
   central part of Basca Chiojdului river basin has the highest
   susceptibility to flash-flood phenomena. Thus, around 30\% of the study
   site has high and very high values of FFPI. The results validation was
   carried out by applying the Prediction Rate and Success Rate. The
   methods revealed the fact that the Multilayer Perceptron Statistical
   Index (MLP-SI) ensemble has the highest efficiency among the 3 methods.

Abstract = {{Flash-floods are increasingly recognized as a frequent natural hazard
   worldwide. Iran has been among the most devastated regions affected by
   the major floods. While the temporal flash-flood forecasting models are
   mainly developed for warning systems, the models for assessing hazardous
   areas can greatly contribute to adaptation and mitigation policy-making
   and disaster risk reduction. Former researches in the flash-flood hazard
   mapping have heightened the urge for the advancement of more accurate
   models. Thus, the current research proposes the state-of-the-art
   ensemble models of boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost) and
   random forest (RF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (BayesGLM)
   methods for higher performance modeling. Furthermore, a pre-processing
   method, namely simulated annealing (SA), is used to eliminate redundant
   variables from the modeling process. Results of the modeling based on
   the hit and miss analysis indicates high performance for both models
   (accuracy = 90-92\%, Kappa = 79-84\%, Success ratio = 94-96\%, Threat
   score = 80-84\%, and Heidke skill score = 79-84\%). The variables of
   distance from the stream, vegetation, drainage density, land use, and
   elevation have shown more contribution among others for modeling the
   flash-flood. The results of this study can significantly facilitate
   mapping the hazardous areas and further assist watershed managers to
   control and remediate induced damages of flood in the data-scarce
   regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Climate change vulnerability of rural households in flood-prone areas of
   Himalayan foothills, West Bengal, India}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY}},
Abstract = {{The Himalayan foothills of West Bengal are a part of the great Eastern
   Himalaya, which is by locational virtue a recognized flood-prone area.
   The area is also well known for frequent and heavy rain storms and
   climate-induced catastrophic events, such as flash floods due to the
   unprecedented rains in the Bhutan Himalaya. Therefore, climate-induced
   disasters like floods have been the prime reasons for rural
   vulnerabilities. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study is to
   find out whether there are any differences between levels of
   vulnerability amidst agriculture-dependent villages and forest
   resource-dependent villages in the same flood-prone area or not. In
   addition, the study will also examine how the agriculture-dependent
   villages are different from forest resource-dependent villages in terms
   of climate vulnerability and vice versa. The climate change
   vulnerability index has been applied, and a total of 100 households have
   been surveyed covering seven dimensions of vulnerability. The exposure
   score was found to be the highest in Raja Bhatkhawa (0.41) followed by
   Nathuar Char (0.30) and Bhelakoba (0.27). No significant differences
   were found in terms of climatic exposure except in Mendabari. Further,
   it has been observed that the resilience factors in households like
   education, workforce opportunities, health, and institutional
   accessibility are highly uneven, which has been creating hinders to the
   adaptive capacity. In the villages where overall vulnerability to
   climate change was found to be high, the adaptive capacity was found to
   be low. Simultaneously, in those villages, the sensitivity was found to
   be high. It has been found that the location of the villages plays an
   important role when it comes to vulnerability because the forest
   villages are relatively more vulnerable than the agricultural villages.
   However, the riverside location of Nathuar Char has made this village
   highly vulnerable; and the people of Nathuar Char have been living with
   floods, and they are trying to adapt with climate-induced floods.
   Finally, it has been observed that vulnerability is context dependent
   (i.e. based on land resources, accessibility to basic infrastructure,
   water and sanitation facilities, and awareness to disasters) and varies
   from household to household.}},

Abstract = {{On 18 May 2015, a severe rainfall event triggered a flash flood in the
   municipality of Salgar, located in the northwestern Colombian Andes.
   This work aims to reconstruct the main hydrological features of the
   flash flood to better understand the processes modulating the occurrence
   of the event. Radar quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs),
   satellite information, and post-event field visits are used to
   reconstruct the Salgar flash flood, in an ungauged basin, addressing the
   relationship among rainfall spatiotemporal structure, soil moisture, and
   runoff generation during successive rainfall events by using a
   conceptual modeling framework including landslide and hydraulic
   submodels. The hydrological model includes virtual tracers to explore
   the role of runoff and subsurface flow and the relative importance of
   convective and stratiform precipitation in flash flood generation.
   Despite potential shortcomings due to the lack of data, the modeling
   results allow an assessment of the impact of the interactions between
   runoff, subsurface flow, and convective-stratiform rainfall on the
   short-term hydrological mechanisms leading to the flash flood event. The
   overall methodology reproduces the magnitude and timing of the La
   Liboriana flash flood peak discharge considerably well, as well as the
   areas of landslide occurrence and flood spots, with limitations due to
   the spatial resolution of the available digital elevation model.
   Simulation results indicate that the flash flood and regional landslide
   features were strongly influenced by the antecedent rainfall, which was
   associated with a northeasterly stratiform event. The latter recharged
   the gravitational and capillary storages within the model, moistening
   the entire basin before the occurrence of the flash flood event and
   impacting the subsurface-runoff partitioning during the flash flood
   event. Evidence suggests that the spatial structure of the rainfall is
   at least as important as the geomorphological features of the basin in
   regulating the occurrence of flash flood events.}},

Abstract = {{Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and bacterial pathogens from combined
   sewer overflow (CSO) in peri-urban streams represent a major public
   health concern worldwide. In this study, the relationships between the
   hydrological regime and the loads and persistence of CSO-borne bacterial
   contaminants among benthic sediments of a small peri-urban stream were
   explored. Combined sewer overflow events and their impact on benthic
   sediment layers at a short distance from a CSO were monitored.
   Concentrations of Escherichia coli (EC) and intestinal enterococci (IE)
   and of two bacterial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and
   Aeromonas caviae (AC), were assessed. Relations with hydraulic,
   hydromorphic and physicochemical factors were analysed. PA cells in
   benthic sediments increased exponentially with time (0.15 log PA per
   day), as long as the river discharge remained below the sediment
   transport. Cycles of erosive floods and low-flow periods were found to
   play a critical role in PA settling and growth among benthic riverbed
   sediments. These hydrological and hydraulic shear forces did not
   correlate with changing IE, EC, and AC concentrations in the benthic
   sediments. Their dynamics were rather related to changing
   physicochemical conditions (total N, phosphate, and organic carbon). AC
   population size decreases most rapidly with a mean rate of 0.04 log per
   day according to the duration of the low-flow period, indicating a poor
   tropism of AC for river systems. River sediments were found significant
   biotopes for PA outdoor development. These analyses demonstrate the
   significance of PA and AC as long- and short-term indicators,
   respectively, of a river microbiological quality.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy precipitation events (HPEs) can lead to natural hazards (e.g.
   floods and debris flows) and contribute to water resources.
   Spatiotemporal rainfall patterns govern the hydrological,
   geomorphological, and societal effects of HPEs. Thus, a correct
   characterisation and prediction of rainfall patterns is crucial for
   coping with these events. Information from rain gauges is generally
   limited due to the sparseness of the networks, especially in the
   presence of sharp climatic gradients. Forecasting HPEs depends on the
   ability of weather models to generate credible rainfall patterns. This
   paper characterises rainfall patterns during HPEs based on
   high-resolution weather radar data and evaluates the performance of a
   high-resolution, convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting
   (WRF) model in simulating these patterns. We identified 41 HPEs in the
   eastern Mediterranean from a 24-year radar record using local thresholds
   based on quantiles for different durations, classified these events into
   two synoptic systems, and ran model simulations for them. For most
   durations, HPEs near the coastline were characterised by the highest
   rain intensities; however, for short durations, the highest rain
   intensities were found for the inland desert. During the rainy season,
   the rain field's centre of mass progresses from the sea inland. Rainfall
   during HPEs is highly localised in both space (less than a 10 km
   decorrelation distance) and time (less than 5 min). WRF model
   simulations were accurate in generating the structure and location of
   the rain fields in 39 out of 41 HPEs. However, they showed a positive
   bias relative to the radar estimates and exhibited errors in the spatial
   location of the heaviest precipitation. Our results indicate that
   convection-permitting model outputs can provide reliable climatological
   analyses of heavy precipitation patterns; conversely, flood forecasting
   requires the use of ensemble simulations to overcome the spatial
   location errors.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term data on flooding events are necessary for understanding the
   flood frequency and magnitude variations, but the available instrumental
   records span only a few decades. Recently, lake sediment sequences have
   emerged as a relatively untapped archive for high-magnitude floods over
   longer timescales. In the present study, multi-proxy data from a
   lacustrine sequence at Timbi in the Dhadhar river basin were analysed to
   determine high magnitude floods in this semi-arid region of western
   India in response to southwest monsoon variability. The results indicate
   the occurrence of discreet high magnitude flood events and depositional
   phases corresponding to different climatic conditions during the mid to
   late Holocene. Three large flash floods between 4830 and 2730 cal yr
   B.P. (Phase-I) have been identified as coeval with flood events from
   fluvial archives and correlated to the widespread period of aridity and
   weak monsoon recorded in the lakes of north western India. A shift in
   the depositional environment from fluvial to lacustrine occurred around
   2730 cal yr B.P. as inferred from an abrupt change in the sediment
   character and palynofacies caused by high intensity flash floods and
   high sediment influx. Phase II (2730-1730 cal yr B.P.) was marked by
   periodic erosion and deposition in the catchment and sediment influx
   during pulses of higher precipitation as evident in the dominance of
   Glomus sp. and Alternaria sp., and relatively low values in
   concentration-related magnetic parameters and S-Ratio. A high magnitude
   flood event occurred at 1770 cal yr B.P. towards the end of phase II.
   During phase III (1730-880 cal yr B.P.) the monsoon was enhanced and
   climate was warmer as suggested by low chi fd\%, SIRM/chi, S-Ratio,
   higher Ba/Sr ratio and presence of aquatic palynomorphs. A high
   percentage of structured Organic Matter (OM), low fungal remains and
   increased Ba/Sr ratios between 880 and 360 cal yr B.P. indicate higher
   lake waters and better monsoon condition during phase IV. The phase V
   (360-0 cal yr B.P.) corresponds to lake level lowering, soil formation
   and eutrophication. The Timbi lake sediments demonstrate the potential
   for lakes in semi-arid alluvial plains of western India to preserve
   proxy flood records providing additional archives for generating
   long-term datasets. The flood record generated substantiates palaeoflood
   data from the fluvial archive suggestive of regional-scale southwest
   monsoon variability. Low frequency-high magnitude floods occurred during
   arid periods and low magnitude-high frequency events during relatively
   strengthened monsoon and thus have implication for linking the
   palaeoflood events to the southwest monsoon intensity in the semi-arid
   continental regions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to analyze the flood hazard in the city of Monza, which
   periodically suffers from overflows from both the river Lambro and the
   urban drainage system during wet weather conditions. A unified Urban
   Flash Flood Model of Monza is therefore developed to capture both
   sources of hazard. The model is first validated by comparing the results
   of simulations with historical data related to the area of Monza, then
   is exploited to obtain maximum flood depth and velocity maps for three
   different return periods. Overall, the results show the different nature
   of the flood-related hazard and the sewer-related hazard: the former is
   concentrated across the rivers whereas the latter spreads patchy over
   the territory. Furthermore, the former features much larger water levels
   and flow velocities, which result in more serious hazard to citizens.}},

Title = {{Assessing flash flood hazard and damages in the southeast United States}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods are common natural hazards in the southeast United States
   (SEUS) as a consequence of frequent torrential rainfall caused by
   tropical storms, thunderstorms, and hurricanes. Understanding flash
   flood characteristics is essential for mitigating the associated risks
   and implementing proactive risk management strategies. In this study,
   flash flood characteristics including frequency, duration, and intensity
   are assessed in addition to their associated property damages. The
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Events
   database as well as hourly precipitation data of the North American Land
   Data Assimilation System project phase-2 (NLDAS-2) are utilised, and
   more than 14,000 flash flood events during 1996-2017 are analysed. Flash
   flood hazard is investigated at county, state, and regional levels
   across the SEUS. Results indicate increasing pattern for the frequency
   and intensity of flash flooding over the SEUS. The frequency of flash
   flooding is found to be higher in spring and summer, whereas the
   duration and intensity of events are higher during winter and fall,
   respectively. The western parts of the SEUS are prone to more frequent
   and intense flash flooding compared to the eastern parts. Overall, our
   analyses suggest that flash flood hazard in Louisiana is higher than
   other states in the SEUS.}},

Abstract = {{Poorly monitored catchments could pose a challenge in the provision of
   accurate flood predictions by hydrological models, especially in
   urbanized areas subject to heavy rainfall events. Data assimilation
   techniques have been widely used in hydraulic and hydrological models
   for model updating (typically updating model states) to provide a more
   reliable prediction. However, in the case of nonlinear systems, such
   procedures are quite complex and time-consuming, making them unsuitable
   for real-time forecasting. In this study, we present a data assimilation
   procedure, which corrects the uncertain inputs (rainfall), rather than
   states, of an urban catchment model by assimilating water-level data.
   Five rainfall correction methods are proposed and their effectiveness is
   explored under different scenarios for assimilating data from one or
   multiple sensors. The methodology is adopted in the city of Sao Carlos,
   Brazil. The results show a significant improvement in the simulation
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Arid and semi-arid areas are often subject to sudden and flash floods,
   causing extended damages to the population and infrastructures. This
   paper presents a method for flood assessment in the Zat watershed (sub
   basin of the Tensift catchment) via 10-minute numerical modeling using
   the HEC-HMS numerical model. To illustrate the calibration and the
   validation process four flood events recorded during (2011-2014) were
   used and two different validation methods were adopted. The comparative
   analysis of simulation results obtained during the calibration and
   validation showed a good compliance with measured data. A Nash-Sutcliff
   of 82.38\% on average over the four events, and an R-2 of 0.65 are
   considered as satisfactory results for the correlation between the
   initial soil moisture conditions and the Curve Number. As part of the
   future steps, this approach could be extrapolated to other watersheds
   with similar contexts, both in Morocco and in other Mediterranean
   regions}},

Journal = {{GEOJOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Vegetable farming in Northeast Bangladesh has developed rapidly over the
   last 10 years, with limitations to field management and marketing. A
   survey was conducted in North-East Bangladesh, specifically Sylhet
   district to identify the main challenges faced by different value chain
   actors and their perception of risk management strategies for vegetable
   production and marketing. One hundred and fifty value chain actors from
   five different Upazilas of the Sylhet District were interviewed.
   Perceived major problems in vegetable production were extreme climate
   events such as flash flood and heavy rain, credit unavailability, and
   low price of vegetables during harvesting time. Form the trader's point
   of view; the major problems were lack of financial assistance, lack of
   storage facility, low-quality product, and supply shortage. More
   experienced commercial vegetable farmers of that region faced less
   challenge. Adoption of new farming techniques, processing of products
   for better prices, crop diversification, storage facility, and crop
   planning were the actor's perceptions to overcome the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation measurements with high spatiotemporal resolution are a
   vital input for hydrometeorological and water resources studies;
   decision-making in disaster management; and weather, climate, and
   hydrological forecasting. Moreover, real-time precipitation estimation
   with high precision is pivotal for the monitoring and managing of
   catastrophic hydroclimate disasters such as flash floods, which
   frequently transpire after extreme rainfall. While algorithms that
   exclusively use satellite infrared data as input are attractive owing to
   their rich spatiotemporal resolution and near-instantaneous
   availability, their sole reliance on cloud-top brightness temperature
   (T-b) readings causes underestimates in wet regions and overestimates in
   dry regions-this is especially evident over the western contiguous
   United States (CONUS). We introduce an algorithm, the Precipitation
   Estimations from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural
   Networks (PERSIANN) Dynamic Infrared-Rain rate model (PDIR), which
   utilizes climatological data to construct a dynamic (i.e., laterally
   shifting) T-b-rain rate relationship that has several notable advantages
   over other quantitative precipitation-estimation algorithms and
   noteworthy skill over the western CONUS. Validation of PDIR over the
   western CONUS shows a promising degree of skill, notably at the annual
   scale, where it performs well in comparison to other satellite-based
   products. Analysis of two extreme landfalling atmospheric rivers show
   that solely IR-based PDIR performs reasonably well compared to other IR-
   and PMW-based satellite rainfall products, marking its potential to be
   effective in real-time monitoring of extreme storms. This research
   suggests that IR-based algorithms that contain the spatiotemporal
   richness and near-instantaneous availability needed for rapid natural
   hazards response may soon contain the skill needed for hydrologic and
   water resource applications.}},

   using paleoflood analysis - An example from the Negev Desert, Israel}},
Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{202}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Direct measurements of boulder entrainment in desert wadis are not
   available. The 2004 flood (peak discharge 470 m(3) s(-1); recurrence
   interval - 120 years) in the hyperarid, ungauged Nahal Hatzera ephemeral
   stream (45 km(2)), transported and deposited 0.85-2.1 m concrete
   boulders and slabs detached from infrastructure upstream and natural
   boulders. EDM and drone air-photographic surveys documented the geometry
   of the study reach and the location of boulders. Analyses of flood
   slackwater deposits established a paleoflood record of 23 floods with
   peak discharges of 200-760 m(3) s(-1), during the last 600 years. 1-D
   HEC-RAS hydraulic analysis provided water surface profiles, discharges
   and hydraulics, along the study reach and velocity, shear stress and
   stream power for each boulder. MAX program and Pearson 3 distribution
   were used for flood frequency analysis. Most of the concrete boulders
   were deposited in the sub-critical backwater of channel constrictions
   where velocities were 1.5-2.1 m s(-1). The largest boulders were
   deposited in super-critical flow where velocity was 8-9.2 m s(-1). The
   alluvial channel enabled to transport these concrete boulders,
   reflecting the unstable, active sandy layer of the channel bed over
   which the boulders moved. The maximum flood shear stress and stream
   power characterize medium-large floods with return period of 20-120
   years and not for the largest floods, as expected. Boulders about 2.1 m
   and weighing about 15 t can be transported at least once in 120 years.
   The shear stress and stream power indicate that the moderate-large
   floods are the most geomorphically effective floods rather than the
   largest floods in Nahal Hatzera basin. Nevertheless, the `geomorphic
   effectiveness' of the 2004 flood - a typical desert flash flood with
   high peak and short duration, was small based on the minor changes along
   the channel and banks indicating that their resistance thresholds were
   not exceeded and energy expenditure was mainly on boulders entrainment
   and transport.}},

Title = {{Geocellular railway drainage systems: Physical and numerical modelling}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The importance of resilient railway infrastructure is paramount when
   considering the increased likelihood of extreme weather and flash flood
   events in coming years. One of the main causes of instability of railway
   tracks is excess water in the trackbed, particularly when it is at or
   above the interface of the ballast and subgrade. Conventional drainage
   systems are susceptible to clogging and deterioration. Resilient track
   drainage systems should therefore have sufficient capacity to allow
   water to dissipate quickly, but they should also be designed to ensure
   long-term operation with minimal or easily performed maintenance. This
   paper presents results from an investigation of a potential new railway
   drainage system using geocellular components. In the paper, the
   development of a large scale physical model is described which
   represents a full scale unit cell of a sleeper-to-sleeper track
   substructure. The physical model includes ballast and subgrade layers,
   under-track and lateral drainage systems, rainfall simulation, and
   instrumentation. Results demonstrate the relative hydraulic response of
   the drainage system with and without the geocellular components. The
   paper also describes the development of a numerical model of the track
   subgrade and drainage system, which was first calibrated and verified
   using experimental data from the physical model, then extended to study
   the effect of certain parameters on the hydraulic response of the
   railway track. Results indicate that the under-track geocellular
   drainage system offers potential benefits in terms of maintaining a
   lower water table level within the subgrade as well as in aiding the
   migration of fines out of the ballast.}},

Abstract = {{Hurricane Harvey produced unprecedented widespread rainfall amounts over
   1000 mm in portions of southeast Texas, including Houston, from 26 to 31
   August 2017. The highly efficient and prolonged warm rain processes
   associated with Harvey played a key role in the catastrophic flooding
   that occurred throughout the region. Precipitation efficiency (PE) is
   widely referred to in the scientific literature when discussing
   excessive precipitation events that lead to catastrophic flash flooding,
   but has yet to be explored or quantified in tropical cyclones coincident
   with polarimetric radar observations. With the introduction of
   dual-polarization radar to the NEXRAD WSR-88D network, polarimetric
   radar variables such as Z(H), Z(DR), and K-DP can be used to gain
   insight into the precipitation processes that contribute to enhanced PE.
   It was found that 6-h mean values of Z(H) between 35 and 45 dBZ, Z(DR)
   between 1 and 1.5 dB, and K-DP greater than 1 degrees km(-1) were
   collocated with the regions of PE greater than 100\% between 27 and 29
   August. Additionally, supercell thunderstorms embedded in the outer
   bands of Harvey were identified via 3-6 km Multi-Radar Multi-Senor
   (MRMS) rotation tracks and were collocated with swaths of enhanced
   positive Z(H), Z(DR), and K-DP. A polarimetric rainfall relationship
   estimates that 1-h mean rainfall rates in these supercells were as high
   as 85 mm h(-1) and made a significant contribution to the excessive
   precipitation event that occurred over the region.}},

   nowcasting systems is the short-term forecast of extreme rainfall events
   such as flash floods and severe thunderstorms. While deep learning
   nowcasting models have recently shown to provide better overall skill
   than traditional echo extrapolation models, they suffer from conditional
   bias, sometimes reporting lower skill on extreme rain rates compared to
   Lagrangian persistence, due to excessive prediction smoothing. This work
   presents a novel method to improve deep learning prediction skills in
   particular for extreme rainfall regimes. The solution is based on model
   stacking, where a convolutional neural network is trained to combine an
   ensemble of deep learning models with orographic features, doubling the
   prediction skills with respect to the ensemble members and their average
   on extreme rain rates, and outperforming them on all rain regimes. The
   proposed architecture was applied on the recently released TAASRAD19
   radar dataset: the initial ensemble was built by training four models
   with the same TrajGRU architecture over different rainfall thresholds on
   the first six years of the dataset, while the following three years of
   data were used for the stacked model. The stacked model can reach the
   same skill of Lagrangian persistence on extreme rain rates while
   retaining superior performance on lower rain regimes.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models produce a quantitative
   precipitation forecast (QPF), which is vital for a wide range of
   applications, especially for accurate flash flood forecasting. The
   under- and over-estimation of forecast uncertainty pose operational
   risks and often encourage overly conservative decisions to be made.
   Since NWP models are subject to many uncertainties, the QPFs need to be
   post-processed. The NWP biases should be corrected prior to their use as
   a reliable data source in hydrological models. In recent years, several
   post-processing techniques have been proposed. However, there is a lack
   of research on post-processing the real-time forecast of NWP models
   considering bias lead-time dependency for short- to medium-range
   forecasts. The main objective of this study is to use the total least
   squares (TLS) method and the lead-time dependent bias correction
   method-known as dynamic weighting (DW)-to post-process forecast
   real-time data. The findings show improved bias scores, a decrease in
   the normalized error and an improvement in the scatter index (SI). A
   comparison between the real-time precipitation and flood forecast
   relative bias error shows that applying the TLS and DW methods reduced
   the biases of real-time forecast precipitation. The results for
   real-time flood forecasts for the events of 2002, 2007 and 2011 show
   error reductions and accuracy improvements of 78.58\%, 81.26\% and
   62.33\%, respectively.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Floods are among the most destructive natural hazards that cost lives
   and disrupt the socioeconomic activities of residents, especially in the
   rapidly growing cities of developing countries. Jeddah, a coastal city
   situated in Saudi Arabia, has experienced severe flash flood events in
   recent years. With intense rainfall, extensive coastal developments, and
   sensitive ecosystems, the city is susceptible to severe flash flood
   risks. The objective of this article is to apply an Analytic Hierarchy
   Process (AHP) model to explore the impacts of flash flood hazards and
   identify the most effective approaches to reducing the flash flood
   impacts in Jeddah using expert's opinions. The study utilizes experts'
   judgments and employs the AHP for data analyses and modeling. The
   results indicated that property loss has the highest probability of
   occurrence in the events of a flash flood with a priority level of 42\%,
   followed by productivity loss (28\%). Injuries and death were rated the
   least priority of 18\% and 12\%, respectively. Concerning flood impact
   reduction alternatives, river management (41\%) and early warning system
   (38\%) are the most favorable options. The findings could assist the
   government to design appropriate measures to safeguard the lives and
   properties of the residents. The study concludes by underscoring the
   significance of incorporating experts' judgments in assessing flash

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, three different flash floods episodes were analyzed,
   which occurred in October 2006, February 2010, and June 2018 in the
   Chalkidiki peninsula (North Greece). The Soil Conservation Service (SCS)
   model and a revised assessment of the CN parameter were applied to
   estimate the flood hydrographs, and Hydrologic Engineering
   Center's-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software was used for the flood
   simulations. Initially, hydrological and hydraulic models were
   calibrated at Vatonias watershed (240.90 km(2), North Greece), where
   three rain gauges and one water level station are located. Vatonias is
   located very close to the Stavros ungauged watersheds and presents
   similar geomorphology and land use conditions. The effectiveness and
   accuracy of the methodology were validated using post-flash-flood
   measurements. The root mean square error goodness of fit was used to
   compare the observed and simulated flood depths. Critical success index
   was calculated for the assessment of the accuracy of observed and
   modeled flooded areas. The results showed that the dense forest
   vegetation was not capable of preventing the flash flood generation or
   reducing the peak discharge, especially in small watersheds
   characterized by short concentration times. The main cause of flash
   flood generation was the human interference that influenced the
   hydraulic characteristics of streams and floodplains. The revised
   assessment of the CN parameter enhanced the estimation and spatial
   distribution of CN over the entire watershed. The results revealed that
   the proposed methodology could be a very useful tool to researchers and
   policy makers for flood risk assessment of higher accuracy and
   effectiveness in ungauged Mediterranean watersheds.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Clarifying hydrologic behavior, especially behavior related to extreme
   events such as flash floods, is vital for flood mitigation and
   management. However, discharge and rainfall measurement data are scarce,
   which is a major obstacle to flood mitigation. This study: (i) simulated
   flash floods on a regional scale using three types of rainfall forcing
   implemented in a land surface model; and (ii) evaluated and compared
   simulated flash floods with the observed discharge. The three types of
   rainfall forcing were those observed by the Automated Meteorological
   Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) (Simulation I), the observed rainfall
   from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transportation (MLIT)
   (Simulation II), and the estimated rainfall from the Multi-purpose
   Transport Satellite (MTSAT), which was downscaled by AMeDAS rainfall
   (Simulation III). MLIT rainfall observations have a denser station
   network over the Ishikari River basin (spacing of approximately 10 km)
   compared with AMeDAS (spacing of approximately 20 km), so they are
   expected to capture the rainfall spatial distribution more accurately. A
   land surface model, the Minimal Advance Treatments of Surface
   Interaction and Runoff (MATSIRO), was implemented for the flash flood
   simulation. The river flow simulations were run over the Ishikari river
   basin at a 1-km grid resolution and a 1-h temporal resolution during
   August 2010. The statistical performance of the river flow simulations
   during a flash flood event on 23 and 24 August 2010 demonstrated that
   Simulation I was reasonable compared with Simulation III. The findings
   also suggest that the advantages of the MTSAT-based estimated rainfall
   (i.e., good spatial distribution) can be coupled with the benefit of
   direct AMeDAS observations (i.e., representation of the true rainfall).}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of the initial impact force is a major task associated with
   flood damage assessment of structures subjected to flash flooding
   especially due to dam break and levee breach. Investigation of failure
   modes such as overturning and sliding due to soil scouring or erosion is
   not relevant if the structure first fails by the massive initial dynamic
   impact. Therefore, a careful assessment of the initial flood impact is
   critical for the design of structures and during the flood damage
   assessment process. In most of the past flood damage studies, total
   flood load acting on the structures was estimated by maximum velocities
   and water depths obtained from the two-dimensional hydrodynamic models
   or the field data. The outcome of these results has shown potential
   uncertainty in current methods. We present a new approach to calculate
   the load on structural components impacted by a dam break wave, by
   modelling the three-dimensional free surface fluid-structure interaction
   (FSI) using the incompressible computational fluid dynamics (ICFD)
   techniques. Two experimental datasets available in the literature are
   used to validate the results. Finally, we conclude that FSI/IFCD method
   can be used to accurately determine the initial impact force on

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A robust compositionally extended black-oil simulation approach is
   developed, which is capable of including the effect of large gas-oil
   capillary pressure for first contact miscible (FCM), and immiscible gas
   injection. The simulation methodology is applied to gas flooding in both
   high and very low permeability reservoirs. For a high permeability
   conventional reservoir, simulations use a five-spot pattern with
   different reservoir pressures to mimic both FCM and immiscible
   displacements. The results show that the simple modified black-oil
   approach can model well both immiscible and miscible floods, as long as
   the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) is matched. For a tight oil-rich
   reservoir, primary depletion and huff-n-puff gas injection are simulated
   including the effect of large gas-oil capillary pressure in flow and in
   flash calculation on recovery. Finally, a dynamic gas-oil relative
   permeability correlation that accounts for the compositional changes
   owing to the produced gas injection is introduced and applied to correct
   for changes in interfacial tension (IFT), and its effect on oil recovery
   is examined. The results show that the new black-oil approach can model
   these processes well and could be implemented when fully compositional
   simulations are computationally too time consuming. For the first time,
   a black-oil type reservoir simulation method is used to simulate
   near-miscible and immiscible produced gas injection enhanced oil
   recovery. It provides a fast and robust alternative for large-scale
   reservoir simulation with the purpose of flaring/venting reduction
   through reinjecting the produced gas into the reservoir for EOR.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and robust short-term rainfall forecasts (nowcasts) are useful
   in operational flood forecasting. However, the high temporal and spatial
   variability of rainfall fields make rainfall nowcasting a challenging

   nowcasting for discharge predictions in three lowland catchments in the

   Deterministic (Lagrangian persistence) and probabilistic (SBMcast)
   nowcasting techniques are used to produce short-term rainfall forecasts
   (up to a few hours ahead), which are used as input for the hydrological
   model WALRUS. Rainfall forecasts were found to deteriorate with
   increasing lead time, often due to underestimation. Discharge could be
   forecasted 25-170 min earlier than without rainfall nowcasting, with the
   best performance for the largest catchment. When accounting for
   catchment response time, the best (but most variable) relative
   performance was found for the smallest catchment. Probabilistic
   nowcasting effectively accounted for the uncertainty associated with
   rainfall and discharge forecasts. The uncertainty in rainfall forecasts
   was found to be largest for the smaller catchments. The uncertainty in
   how much earlier the discharge could be forecasted (the gain in lead
   time) ranged from 15 to 50 min.}},

Title = {{ReAFFIRM: Real-time Assessment of Flash Flood Impacts - a Regional
   high-resolution Method}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods evolve rapidly in time, which poses particular challenges
   to emergency managers. One way to support decision-making is to
   complement models that estimate the flash flood hazard (e.g. discharge
   or return period) with tools that directly translate the hazard into the
   expected socio-economic impacts. This paper presents a method named
   ReAFFIRM that uses gridded rainfall estimates to assess in real time the
   flash flood hazard and translate it into the corresponding impacts. In
   contrast to other studies that mainly focus on individual river
   catchments, the approach allows for monitoring entire regions at high
   resolution. The method consists of the following three components: (i)
   an already existing hazard module that processes the rainfall into
   values of exceeded return period in the drainage network, (ii) a flood
   map module that employs the flood maps created within the EU Floods
   Directive to convert the return periods into the expected flooded areas
   and flood depths, and (iii) an impact assessment module that combines
   the flood depths with several layers of socioeconomic exposure and
   vulnerability. Impacts are estimated in three quantitative categories:
   population in the flooded area, economic losses, and affected critical
   infrastructures. The performance of ReAFFIRM is shown by applying it in
   the region of Catalonia (NE Spain) for three significant flash flood
   events. The results show that the method is capable of identifying areas
   where the flash floods caused the highest impacts, while some locations
   affected by less significant impacts were missed. In the locations where
   the flood extent corresponded to flood observations, the assessments of
   the population in the flooded area and affected critical infrastructures
   seemed to perform reasonably well, whereas the economic losses were
   systematically overestimated. The effects of different sources of
   uncertainty have been discussed: from the estimation of the hazard to
   its translation into impacts, which highly depends on the quality of the
   employed datasets, and in particular on the quality of the rainfall
   inputs and the comprehensiveness of the flood maps.}},

Title = {{Orographic Controls on Subdaily Rainfall Statistics and Flood Frequency
   in the Colorado Front Range, USA}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Generalizable relationships for how subdaily rainfall statistics imprint
   into runoff statistics are lacking. We use the Colorado Front Range,
   known for destructive rainfall-triggered floods and landslides, to
   assess whether orographic patterns in runoff generation are a direct
   consequence of rainstorm climatology. Climatological analysis relies on
   a dense network of tipping-bucket rain gauges and gridded precipitation
   frequency estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration to evaluate relationships among subdaily rainfall
   statistics, topography, and flood frequency throughout the South Platte
   River basin. We find that event-scale rainfall statistics only weakly
   depend on elevation, suggesting that orographic gradients in runoff
   ``extremes{''} are not simply a consequence of rainfall patterns. In
   contrast, bedrock exposure strongly varies with elevation in a way that
   plausibly explains enhanced runoff generation at lower elevations via
   reduced water storage capacity. These findings are suggestive of
   feedbacks between bedrock river evolution and hillslope hydrology not
   typically included in models of landscape evolution.
   Plain Language Summary Large floods generated along the eastern slopes
   of the Colorado Front Range, USA, threaten communities near the
   transition between the Great Plains and Colorado Rockies. While seasonal
   snowpack and snowmelt control mean water supply and streamflow, runoff
   generated during rare, intense rainstorms at lower mountain elevations
   generates the largest floods in this region. In this work, we assess how
   well spatial patterns in flood frequency mirror rainstorm properties. We
   find that patterns in subdaily properties of rainstorms (i.e.,
   intensities, durations) fail to explain the differences in the sizes of
   the largest floods. Instead, we show how ``rockiness{''} strongly
   decreases with increasing elevation in the unglaciated part of the
   landscape and hypothesize that systematic differences in land surface
   properties (such as infiltration capacity and soil depth) may amplify
   the runoff response to rare rainfall events at low to intermediate
   mountain elevations. These results highlight the need for better
   constraints on elevation-dependent properties of the land surface. Such
   properties may be as important to explaining spatial patterns in the
   frequency of floods as is understanding the climatology of ``extreme{''}
   rainfall itself.}},

Title = {{Vulnerability assessment of flash floods in Wadi Dahab Basin, Egypt}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Floods are considered one of the most severe natural disasters
   worldwide. They impact vast areas, particularly in arid/semi-arid
   regions, causing serious damages with thousands of human casualties and
   billions of Euros in economic losses. This study contributes to a
   comprehensive evaluation of flash flooding occurrences, impacts, and
   possible mitigation. In this study, The Dahab region in southern Egypt's
   Sinai Peninsula was selected for flash flooding vulnerability
   assessment. Although located in an arid region, it suffers from frequent
   and severe flash floods. Here, a straightforward workflow was applied to
   simulate the impact of flash flooding and assess the vulnerability of
   the Dahab area via consideration of a maximum storm event as a worst-
   case scenario. Originally, morphometric analysis was performed to
   determine the most hazardous sub-basins susceptible to flash flooding.
   The highest recorded storm event in the region was selected to calculate
   the maximum volume of surface runoff for the model simulation. Then, the
   hydrologic model and River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software were used
   to calculate the inundation level across the entire city of Dahab.
   Despite some data limitations, this study shows clearly that the Dahab
   area would have problems incurring from flash flooding if no mitigation
   measures were to be considered. Results indicate that the area of Dahab
   is greatly vulnerable to flash flooding with approximately 72\% of the
   total infrastructure being negatively impacted in the worst-case
   scenario. The adopted approach used in this study can be applied
   efficiently in similar regions in the Sinai Peninsula or elsewhere.}},

Title = {{A 2D hydrodynamic model for shallow water flows with significant
   infiltration losses}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Abstract = {{Infiltration losses may be significant and warrant proper incorporation
   into mathematical models for river floods in arid and semi-arid areas,
   rainfall-induced surface runoffs in watersheds and swashes on beaches.
   Here, a depth-averaged two-dimensional hydrodynamic model is presented
   for such processes based on the cell-centred finite volume method on
   unstructured meshes, with the full Green-Ampt equation evaluating the
   infiltration rate. A local time stepping strategy is employed along with
   thread parallelization with Open Multi-processing and high-performance
   computing to reduce model run time and therefore facilitate applications
   for large-scale processes. The numerical solutions generally agree with
   the experimental and field-measured data for typical cases with
   significant infiltration losses. The case study shows that neglecting
   infiltration leads to an overestimated discharge hydrograph, which
   cannot be compensated by means of varied bed resistance as estimated by
   Manning roughness, and the infiltration parameters play disparate roles
   in modifying shallow flows compared with Manning roughness. In addition,
   infiltration affects bed shear stress, which in turn modifies the
   critical bed sediment size that could be initiated for incipient motion
   by the flow and therefore needs to be properly accounted for when
   sediment transport and morphological evolution are to be resolved.}},

Title = {{The sedimentology of an ephemeral fluvial-aeolian succession}},
Journal = {{SEDIMENTOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Ephemeral fluvial systems are commonly associated with arid to semi-arid
   climates. Although their complex sedimentology and depositional settings
   have been described in much detail, depositional models depicting
   detailed lateral and vertical relationships, and interactions with
   coeval depositional environments, are lacking compared to
   well-recognized meandering and braided fluvial systems. This study
   critically evaluates the applicability of current models for ephemeral
   fluvial systems to an ancient arid fluvial example of the Lower Jurassic
   Kayenta Formation of the Colorado Plateau, USA. The study employs
   detailed sedimentary logging, palaeocurrent analysis and photogrammetric
   panels across the regional extent of the Kayenta. A generic model that
   accounts for the detailed sedimentology of a sandy arid ephemeral
   fluvial system (drawing upon both ancient and geomorphological studies)
   is developed, along with analysis of the spatial and temporal
   interactions with the aeolian setting. Results show that the ephemeral
   system is dominated by laterally and vertically amalgamated, poorly
   channelized to sheet-like elements, with abundant upper flow regime flat
   beds and high sediment load structures formed between periods of lower
   flow regime conditions. Through interaction with a coeval aeolian
   system, most of the fluvial deposits are dominated by sand-grade
   sediment, unlike many modern ephemeral fluvial systems that contain a
   high proportion of conglomeratic and/or finer grained mudstone and
   siltstone deposits. During dominantly fluvial deposition, high width to
   thickness ratios are observed for channelized and sheet-like elements.
   However, with increasing aridity, the aeolian environment becomes
   dominant and fluvial deposition is restricted to interdune corridors,
   resulting in lower width to thickness ratio channels dominated by
   flash-flood and debris-flow facies. The data presented here, coupled
   with modern examples of ephemeral systems and flood regimes, suggest
   that ephemeral flow produces and preserves distinctive sedimentological
   traits that can not only be recognized in outcrops, but also within
   core.}},

Title = {{Flash flood potential prioritization of sub-basins in an ungauged basin
   in Turkey using traditional multi-criteria decision-making methods}},
Journal = {{SOFT COMPUTING}},
Abstract = {{Morphometric analysis of watersheds based on morphometric parameters is
   the most widely accepted method for watershed prioritization. However,
   traditional methods adopted for prioritization of sub-basins lack a
   standard classification of the morphometric parameters and ranges of
   their values. So, in this study several multi-criteria decision-making
   (MCDM) methods and a number of traditional methods are used for
   watershed prioritization regarding the flash flood potential of the
   sub-basins. Akcay, a small ungauged basin in Turkey, was chosen as the
   study area, and 12 morphometric parameters were determined for the
   basin. The geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph concept
   coupled with Monte Carlo analysis was used to estimate the flood yield
   of the basin due to the lack of flow data. Kendall tau and Spearman
   correlation coefficient tests and receiver operating characteristics
   analysis were performed to validate the results of the traditional
   methods and the MCDM approaches for prioritization of the sub-basins.
   Results showed that the AHP method could well predict the sub-basins
   with higher flood potential, while the methodology adopted in the study
   to determine the criteria weights obtained from ANP method in MCDM
   improved the prediction capability of those approaches, especially
   VIKOR. The initial values of criteria weights were determined to be
   effective on the predictions and sensitivity analysis. When the results
   of traditional methods and MCDM approaches were compared, the MCDM
   approaches were found to give improved results. This study showed that
   MCDM approaches can be used to provide an efficient management of basins

Title = {{Aquatic community structure as sentinel of recent environmental changes
   unraveled from lake sedimentary records from the Atacama Desert, Chile}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{The Atacama Desert (21-26 degrees S) is currently one of the driest
   places on Earth and metal(loid) s are of special concern for this
   region, which hosts the largest-known porphyry copper deposits produced
   in Chile. Evidence of past environmental conditions is commonly
   preserved in natural archives, such as lacustrine sediments. Sediment
   records obtained from Inca Coya Lake (22 degrees 20'S-68 degrees 35'W,
   2534 m.a.s.l.), a small lake located in the Atacama Desert, reflected
   the evolution of regional mining activity during the 20th century and
   sedimentation associated with decadal climate variability. We studied
   the aquatic community structure changes recorded in sediment records
   from Inca Coya Lake. By analysis of magnetic properties (susceptibility,
   hysteresis curves and Curie temperatures), grain size and geochemical
   composition of the sediments, we identified environmental periods and
   changes in the community of benthic and planktonic organisms (diatoms
   and diapausing egg bank). We identified three detrital episodes that we
   interpret as dry/wet phases during the last 90 years associated with the
   increase of flash flood events promoting hypoxia oscillations;
   anthropogenic (mining activity) signals were also identified.
   Invertebrate community structure (primary consumers) reflected the metal
   exposure, measured as changes in assemblage composition through species
   turnover. Diatom community composition was best associated with
   variables related to wetter/drier alternation and consequent changes in
   oxygen availability. Bioindicators analyzed (diatoms, diapausing egg
   bank and invertebrate community) demonstrated to be excellent indicators
   of the bioavailability of compounds in the aquatic ecosystem of Inca
   Coya Lake, allowing the environmental impact assessment of the water
   resources due to flash floods and mining activity in the driest desert
   of the world.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{152}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a fast statistical anomaly detector at the
   aggregated-level for two types of anomalies: floods and flash crowds.
   The performance of the statistical anomaly detectors is significantly
   dependent on the accuracy of statistical modeling. Thus, we initially
   introduce a new efficient statistical model for the network traffic
   called Gamma Normal mixture (GNM). We study the compatibility of GNM and
   network traffic using different tests. Consequently, we design a novel
   anomaly detector based on using the generalized likelihood ratio test
   (GLRT) and GNM. Moreover, to more accurately determine the position of
   the anomalies, overlapped sliding windows have been applied in the
   aggregation step. To evaluate the performance of the proposed anomaly
   detector, we use receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Experimental
   results under public network traces, confirm the high efficiency of the
   proposed method. Also, the comparison of the proposed anomaly detector
   with its nearest competitor verifies the higher performance and lower
   computational load in utilizing the new strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The city of Antananarivo is located in the central highlands of
   Madagascar, and is the largest urban center of the island. Considering
   the frequent heavy cyclonic rains frequently affecting the area, its
   geomorphological context is particularly prone to geo-hydrological
   hazards, such as landslides and flash floods, as recently proved during
   the disastrous events of the winters of 2015 and 2018. Field data and
   high-resolution remote sensing data interpretation (DEMs and satellite
   orthophotos) were combined in order to produce detailed hydrographic and
   geomorphological maps. The aim was to understand the processes acting in
   the Analamanga hill area, with special regards to the effect of human
   activity in modeling the natural landforms and exacerbating the
   geo-hydrological hazards. The obtained maps will provide
   management-planning tools to be used as a first step towards a risk

Title = {{Trends in extreme rainfall and hydrogeometeorological disasters in the
   Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo: a review}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES}},
Abstract = {{Our paper reviews recent progress in the study and understanding of
   observed trends in extreme rainfall events in the Metropolitan Area of
   Sao Paulo (MASP). These are discussed in relation to hydrometeorological
   hazards that trigger natural disasters, such as flash floods,
   landslides, and droughts, that affect the population and local
   economies. A review of the most updated literature on rainfall and
   extremes in the MASP shows a significant increase in the total volume of
   rainy-season rainfall during the last seven decades. While there were
   practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s,
   these days have been occurring two to five times a year in the last 10
   years. This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas,
   such as slopes and banks of watercourses, leads to inundation, flooding,
   and landslides. Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate
   variability but can also be related to global warming and/or
   urbanization. There is ample evidence of an increasing risk of
   rainfall-related hazards in the MASP. This is particularly so for
   landslides in vulnerable areas. Exposure will continue to lead to risk
   increases. This calls for significant improvement in climate and
   disaster risk reduction and management efforts in the MASP region.}},

Title = {{Application of logistic regression to simulate the influence of rainfall
   genesis on storm overflow operations: a probabilistic approach}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{595-614}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{One of the key parameters constituting the basis for the operational
   assessment of stormwater systems is the annual number of storm
   overflows. Since uncontrolled overflows are a source of pollution washed
   away from the surface of the catchment area, which leads to imbalanced
   receiving waters, there is a need for their prognosis and potential
   reduction. The paper presents a probabilistic model for simulating the
   annual number of storm overflows. In this model, an innovative solution
   is to use the logistic regression method to analyze the impact of
   rainfall genesis on the functioning of a storm overflow (OV) in the
   example of a catchment located in the city of Kielce (central Poland).
   The developed model consists of two independent elements. The first
   element of the model is a synthetic precipitation generator, in which
   the simulation of rainfall takes into account its genesis resulting from
   various processes and phenomena occurring in the troposphere. This
   approach makes it possible to account for the stochastic nature of
   rainfall in relation to the annual number of events. The second element
   is the model of logistic regression, which can be used to model the
   storm overflow resulting from the occurrence of a single rainfall event.
   The paper confirmed that storm overflow can be modeled based on data on
   the total rainfall and its duration. An alternative approach was also
   proposed, providing the possibility of predicting storm overflow only
   based on the average rainfall intensity. Substantial simplification in
   the simulation of the phenomenon under study was achieved compared with
   the works published in this area to date. It is worth noting that the
   coefficients determined in the logit models have a physical
   interpretation, and the universal character of these models facilitates
   their easy adaptation to other examined catchment areas.
   The calculations made in the paper using the example of the examined
   catchment allowed for an assessment of the influence of rainfall
   characteristics (depth, intensity, and duration) of different genesis on
   the probability of storm overflow. Based on the obtained results, the
   range of the variability of the average rainfall intensity, which
   determines the storm overflow, and the annual number of overflows
   resulting from the occurrence of rain of different genesis were defined.
   The results are suited for the implementation in the assessment of storm
   overflows only based on the genetic type of rainfall. The results may be
   used to develop warning systems in which information about the predicted
   rainfall genesis is an element of the assessment of the rainwater system
   and its facilities. This approach is an original solution that has not
   yet been considered by other researchers. On the other hand, it
   represents an important simplification and an opportunity to reduce the
   amount of data to be measured.}},

Title = {{IMPACT OF HEADWATER HYDROLOGICAL DEFICIT ON THE DOWNSTREAM FLOOD-BASED
   FARMING SYSTEM IN NORTHERN ETHIOPIA}},
Journal = {{IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE}},
Abstract = {{Flood-based farming is a means of improving crop production in
   rain-deficit lowlands. Such spate irrigation systems are growing in
   importance, although the effects of headwater hydrological deficit on
   downstream flood farming are lacking evidence. This study investigates
   the impacts of headwater hydrological deficit on the extent of
   spate-irrigated agriculture in the Guguf spate system. The length of
   canals and area of spate-irrigated agriculture to the right and left of
   the Guguf River for the 1980s and 2010s were tracked using a global
   positioning system and mapped in a geographic information system
   interface, while climate data were collected from National
   Meteorological Agency. Trends of selected hydroclimatic variables were
   analysed using linear regression and the Pettitt test. The flash floods
   have shrunk by 7.36 x 10(6) m(3), as a result of which the length of
   canals and area of spate-based farms declined by 1.37 km and 1540 ha,
   i.e. 35 and 57.5\%, respectively, in only three decades. This
   corresponds to an average withdrawal of -44.0 ha yr?(1). A single 1
   million m(3) decline in flash floods caused a 366.4 ha decline in
   spate-based farms. Moreover, farm fields located next to the river
   course are less affected, compared to those at the tail of the scheme.
   If the current trend continues, there is a high risk that the remaining
   farms currently receiving floods may find themselves outside of the
   spate systems. Therefore, we suggest that flood management technologies
   are needed to optimize the efficiency of soil moisture in the spate
   system. (c) 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are among the most severe natural hazards that cause
   disastrous environmental and human impacts. The city of Gabes (Southern
   Tunisia) is prone to harmful flooding, because of its location on a low
   plane and its extremely erratic rainfall distribution. Flood risk
   associated with this is expected to increase further in the coming years
   due to the high rate of urbanization and an ever growing population. A
   particular interest is given to a major flooding event, which is the
   single event that hit the region in the summer season over the last
   century. Statistical tools, satellite images treatment and analysis,
   meteorological observation data, Geographic Information System (GIS),
   and survey data were considered in order to understand and explore the
   different causes of this disaster, its extent and its consequences. ERA5
   is a new global reanalysis tool which was used in this study to evaluate
   spatial and temporal extent of the examined major rainfall event. A
   survey was also conducted with 108 participants from different areas of
   the city. This latter revealed a variety of causes which amplified the
   flood disaster. The results obtained showed that the flood risk depends
   not only on rainfall intensity and the event total duration but also on
   land use, urban development, oasis destruction, and other anthropogenic
   settings. In this study, procedures are developed to classify and rank
   the causes and the impacts from the least to the most severe, with
   special attention to certain problematic spots in the city that were
   analyzed in detail. Flooding extent areas were estimated and were shown
   to be in good agreement with the observation data. Recommendations and
   scenarios to mitigate flood risk are also provided.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at evaluating the performances of flash-flood forecasts
   issued from deterministic and ensemble meteorological prognostic
   systems. The hydrometeorological modeling chain includes the Weather
   Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) forcing the rainfall-runoff model
   MARINE dedicated to flash floods. Two distinct ensemble prediction
   systems accounting for (i) perturbed initial and lateral boundary
   conditions of the meteorological state and (ii) mesoscale model physical
   parameterizations have been implemented on the Agly catchment of the
   eastern Pyrenees with three subcatchments exhibiting different rainfall
   regimes.
   Different evaluations of the performance of the hydrometeorological
   strategies have been performed: (i) verification of short-range ensemble
   prediction systems and corresponding streamflow forecasts, for a better
   understanding of how forecasts behave; (ii) usual measures derived from
   a contingency table approach, to test an alert threshold exceedance; and
   (iii) overall evaluation of the hydrometeorological chain using the
   continuous rank probability score, for a general quantification of the
   ensemble performances.
   Results show that the overall discharge forecast is improved by both
   ensemble strategies with respect to the deterministic forecast.
   Threshold exceedance detections for flood warning also benefit from
   large hydrometeorological ensemble spread. There are no substantial
   differences between both ensemble strategies on these test cases in
   terms of both the issuance of flood warnings and the overall
   performances, suggesting that both sources of external-scale uncertainty
   are important to take into account.}},

Journal = {{GEOHERITAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Most geologic and geomorphologic features emerged on a deltaic plain
   resulted from the interplay of marine, land and river, of which are some
   have the potential to be a geoheritage site, this is called a
   geomorphosite. Over time, human impact due to settlements on the
   geomorphosite, reshaped and transformed the site to geoarcheomorphosite.
   The Great Pelusium, or Tell El-Farama, which is located along the Tineh
   Plain at the NE extreme of the Nile Delta between the third and fifth c.
   AD, is classified as a geoarcheomorphosite. The location includes
   several geomorphosites, such as the accreted coastal ridges, which
   record Late Holocene sea level changes. It also includes traces of the
   flash flood on the Pelusiac branch during the eighth c. AD, with the
   fluvial flood plain, natural levee, and crevasse splays, on which the
   Great Pelusium, Tell El-Luli, Tell El-Fadah, and Tell El-Makhzan were
   constructed. Recently, the area subjected to a hub development project,
   which may represent anthropogenic hazards that threaten the Great
   Pelusium. This study aims to quantify the potential anthropogenic
   hazards. The change detection shows that in 1984 the area of the
   geoarcheomorphosites was 424.8 km(2), representing approximately 67.1\%
   of the Tineh Plain, in addition to the sand dune area of 75 km(2),
   representing 11.8\%. In 2018, the area saw agricultural activities, fish
   farms, and an urban expansion that covered approximately 244.2 km(2),
   representing 38\% of the Tineh Plain. The construction of a new hub in
   the Suez Canal corridor and the addition of a new community of one
   million people in an area of 164 km(2), representing 30.3\% of the
   plain, will add more pressure on the geodiversity. A conservation plan
   is recommended in the form of sustainable development to save an
   important area of geoheritage in Egypt and convert the area into a
   tourism destination.}},

Abstract = {{Pluvial or flash floods generated by heavy precipitation events cause
   large economic damage and loss of life worldwide. As discharge
   observations from such extreme occurrences are rare, especially on the
   scale of small catchments or even hillslopes, data from artificial
   sprinkling experiments offer valuable information on runoff generation
   processes, overland and subsurface flow rates, and response times. We
   conducted 132 large-scale sprinkling experiments on natural hillslopes
   at 23 sites with different soil types and geology on pastures and arable
   land within the federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg in south-western
   Germany. The experiments were realized between 2016 and 2017. Simulated
   rainfall events of varying durations were based on (a) the site-specific
   100-year return periods of rainfall with different durations and (b) the
   maximum rainfall intensity observed locally. The 100m(2) experimental
   area was divided into three individual plots, and overland and
   subsurface flow, soil moisture, and water level dynamics in the
   temporarily saturated soil zone were measured at 1 min resolution.
   Furthermore, soil characteristics were described in detail for each
   site. The data were carefully processed and corrected for measurement
   errors and combined into a consistent and easy-to-use database. The
   experiments revealed large variability in possible runoff responses to
   similar rainfall characteristics. In general, agricultural fields
   produced more overland flow than grassland. The latter generated hardly
   any runoff during the first simulated 100-year event on initially dry
   soils. The data set provides valuable information on runoff generation
   variability from natural hillslopes and may be used for the development
   and evaluation of hydrological models, especially those considering
   physical processes governing runoff generation during extreme
   precipitation events.}},

Abstract = {{Flooding is one of the most devastating natural events and leads to
   enormous and recurring loss of life, properties, and resources around
   the globe. With climate change and accelerating urbanization, flood
   disasters in China have increasingly affected the sustainable
   development of metropolitan areas. Risk assessment is an essential step
   in flood management and disaster mitigation, which provide a
   quantitative measure of flood risk. However, the difficulty of flood
   risk zoning is dealing with the uncertainty of the evaluation process
   and the complicated non-linear relationship between indicators and risk
   levels. To address this issue, a fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) method
   based on combined weight (CW) was utilized in this paper to generate
   flood risk maps at a grid-scale (1 x 1 km). For the case study in the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area (BTH) in China, fourteen
   indicators were selected to construct the flood risk assessment model
   based on the FSE approach integrated with ArcGIS. The research
   demonstrates that moderate, high, and very high risk zones are
   distributed in the southeast fluvial plain of the BTH area, accounting
   for 31.36\% of the total land area. Meanwhile, low and very-low risk
   zones occupy 68.64\% of the total land area, and are primarily located
   in the high plateau and mountain regions in the northwest. We analyzed
   the risk level of each county and proposed risk mitigation measures
   based on field investigations. The verified risk assessment results were
   spatially consistent with the historical flood disaster records and loss
   positions, indicating the accuracy and reliability of the risk
   assessment map using the FSE approach. Compared with the IPCC
   (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) TAR (Third Assessment
   Report) and AR5 (Fifth Assessment Report) methods, FSE has significant
   advantages in handling uncertainty, complexity, and the non-linear
   relationship between indices and risk grades. This study provides a
   novel quantitative method for flood risk assessment in metropolitan
   areas and practical implications for urban flood management.}},

   Pakistan}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Pakistan experiences several torrential rainfall events for many years
   due to interactive role of midlatitude atmospheric and warm moist
   monsoon circulations. Deadly events such as flash flooding, runoff, and
   mudslides may trigger by torrential rainfall events which pose
   significant threat to human assets. This study was undertaken based on
   three severe weather events (1988, 2010, and 2013) by using percentage
   departure to identify wet and dry years during the period 1985-2016,
   which occurred over northern Pakistan. Rainfall data were obtained from
   14 synoptic stations of Pakistan Meteorological Department, which were
   analyzed at daily, monthly, and annual bases. The data sets of Climate
   Research Unit, Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, and Pakistan
   Meteorological Department are used to justify the Weather Research and
   Forecasting model simulation and for analyzing the various atmospheric
   and diagnostic variables. Results showed teleconnection between
   large-scale circulation pattern and South Asian summer monsoon during
   the selected events. Detailed analysis revealed that during all three
   events, a westerly trough was moving in the north of Pakistan and
   well-marked monsoon circulations were present at the lower levels. It
   was observed that the interaction of two weather systems triggered heavy
   rainfall over area of interest. In addition, high vorticity at all
   levels and extension of westerly trough to the surface resulted in heavy
   rainfall and the penetration of upper-level circulations anomalies
   consists of blocking signature over Eurasia along with Tibetan
   anticyclone. Hence, the monsoon low-pressure system provides moisture
   convergence and upper-level westerly trough results in upper-level
   divergence to enhance the extreme rainfall events.}},

Title = {{Exposure to Geo-Hydrological Hazards of the Metropolitan Area of Genoa,
   Italy: A Multi-Temporal Analysis of the Bisagno Stream}},

Abstract = {{Geo-hydrological risk reduction policies are becoming a critical
   challenge for environmental sustainability, both at the national and
   international levels. The reason is twofold: On the one hand, climate
   change has increase rainfall frequency and intensity, while on the
   other, reckless urban expansion has increased exposure to such hazards
   over time. Italy is a country that is very vulnerable to flood and
   landslide hazard; the city of Genoa, which, in recent decades, has been
   frequently hit by severe floods, has risen to symbolize Italian
   geo-hydrological risk. Recent studies on Genoa's geo-hydrological hazard
   have focused on the analysis of hydro-geomorphological features of the
   Bisagno stream basin, yet their main focus was on hazard control. Very
   little research has been done to enhance the understanding of the source
   of risk in such catchments. This paper presents a study on the increased
   urban exposure and vulnerability to geo-hydrological hazard along the
   Bisagno stream catchment area over the last 200 years. Morphometric
   analyses were coupled with historical documents showing the evolution of
   the urban layout in this area. The results show that the ``Bisagno
   Master Plan{''}, a territorial planning strategy aimed at reducing
   geo-hydrological hazard and risk, has not produced the expected
   benefits. In spite of the plan, critical changes in land use and the
   hydrographic network, along with uncontrolled anthropization of the
   Genoa metropolitan area, has continued over the last two decades.}},

Title = {{Implementation of Nature-Based Solutions for Hydro-Meteorological Risk
   Reduction in Small Mediterranean Catchments: The Case of Portofino
   Natural Regional Park, Italy}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Nature-based solutions (NBS) are usually defined as complementary or
   alternative solutions to ``grey infrastructures{''} (traditionally made
   with cement) aimed at conserving and regenerating the functionality of
   natural and semi-natural ecosystems. The research to date shows a
   considerable potential of NBS to address the current challenges related
   to climate change and geo-hydrological risks. Despite significant
   interest in NBS by researchers and practitioners, knowledge concerning
   their practical implementation, monitoring, and evaluation is still
   lacking. This is particularly true for large-scale NBS. The present
   paper discusses how such solutions can be implemented in the context of
   hydro-meteorological risk reduction in small Mediterranean catchments
   with a strong tourist vocation. The work presented here is situated
   within the RECONECT Project (Regenerating ECOsystems with Nature-based
   solutions for hydro-meteorological risk rEduCTion), which aims to
   contribute to a European reference framework on NBS by demonstrating,
   upscaling, and replicating large-scale NBS in rural and natural areas.
   The Italian case study of RECONECT is the Portofino Natural Regional
   Park, which represents a unique natural landscape element with high
   ecologic, social, and economic (touristic) value, which is threatened by
   a range of geo-hydrological hazards, such as flash floods,
   hyper-concentrated floods, shallow landslides, rockfalls, and storm
   surges. This paper also presents details of NBS interventions in two
   pilot catchments (San Fruttuoso and Paraggi) visited by thousands of
   tourists throughout the year. It addresses some of the key aspects
   related to monitoring meteorological and hydrological processes, as well
   as remote sensing activities (i.e., LiDAR surveys), which are necessary
   for the identification of critical-instability areas along waterways and
   the reconstruction of dry stone walls. Lastly, a discussion of relevant
   mitigation and adaptation strategies that are potentially replicable at
   national and international levels is also provided.}},

   Flooding}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Floods are a prominent risk factor in the world of public health, as
   there is a risk of dispersal of harmful biological and chemical
   contaminants in floodwater. As climate change increases, the occurrence
   of natural disasters and risk of adverse health outcomes due to flash
   flooding also increases. Fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia
   coli and Enterococci, are often encountered in contaminated floodwater
   and can cause gastrointestinal illnesses as well as a variety of
   infections. In August 2016, East Baton Rouge and surrounding parishes in
   Louisiana suffered heavy floods due to intense rainfall. No study of
   water quality during flooding has been conducted previously in Baton
   Rouge, Louisiana. Twenty-three pre-flush and post-flush water samples
   were collected immediately from accessible homes that had been affected
   by the floods in order to quantify concentrations of fecal indicator
   bacteria. These samples were analyzed for the presence of E. coli and
   Enterococci through both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
   and the IDEXX enzyme substrate method. The qPCR results indicated that
   30\% of the samples contained Enterococci and 61\% of the samples
   contained E. coli, with the highest concentrations found in the
   pre-flush outdoor hose and the pre-flush kitchen tap. The IDEXX method
   yielded total coliforms in 65\% of the samples, E. coli in 4\%, and
   Enterococci in 35\%, with the highest concentrations in the pre-flush
   outdoor faucet and the pre-flush post-filtration kitchen tap. Physical
   parameters including temperature, barometer pressure, dissolved oxygen,
   oxidation reduction potential, pH, conductivity, and salinity of these
   samples were also recorded. Of these parameters, conductivity and
   salinity were significant, suggesting they may positively influence E.
   coli and Enterococci growth.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters. The
   comprehensive identification of the spatiotemporal characteristics and
   driving factors of a flash flood is the basis for the scientific
   understanding of the formation mechanism and the distribution
   characteristics of flash floods. In this study, we explored the
   spatiotemporal patterns of flash floods in Fujian Province from 1951 to
   2015. Then, we analyzed the driving forces of flash floods in geomorphic
   regions with three different grades based on three methods, namely,
   geographical detector, principal component analysis, and multiple linear
   regression. Finally, the sensitivity of flash floods to the gross
   domestic product, village point density, annual maximum one-day
   precipitation (Rx1day), and annual total precipitation from days > 95th
   percentile (R95p) was analyzed. The analytical results indicated that
   (1) The counts of flash floods rose sharply from 1988, and the spatial
   distribution of flash floods mainly extended from the coastal low
   mountains, hills, and plain regions of Fujian (IIA2) to the low-middle
   mountains, hills, and valley regions in theWuyi mountains (IIA4) from
   1951 to 2015. (2) From IIA2 to IIA4, the impact of human activities on
   flash floods was gradually weakened, while the contribution of
   precipitation indicators gradually strengthened. (3) The sensitivity
   analysis results revealed that the hazard factors of flash floods in
   different periods and regions had significant differences in Fujian
   Province. Based on the above results, it is necessary to accurately
   forecast extreme precipitation and improve the economic development
   model of the IIA2 region.}},

Abstract = {{Model accuracy and running speed are the two key issues for flood
   warning in urban areas. Traditional hydrodynamic models, which have a
   rigorous physical mechanism for flood routine, have been widely adopted
   for water level prediction of rainwater pipe network. However, with the
   amount of pipes increasing, both the running speed and data availability
   of hydrodynamic models would be decreased rapidly. To achieve a
   real-time prediction for the water level of the rainwater pipe network,
   a new framework based on a machine learning method was proposed in this
   paper. The spatial and temporal autocorrelation of water levels for
   adjacent manholes was revealed through theoretical analysis, and then a
   support vector machine (SVM)-based machine learning model was developed,
   in which the water levels of adjacent manholes and
   rivers-near-by-outlets at the last time step were chosen as the
   independent variables, and then the water levels at the current time
   step can be computed by the proposed machine learning model with
   calibrated parameters. The proposed framework was applied in Fuzhou
   city, China. It turns out that the proposed machine learning method can
   forecast the water level of the rainwater pipe network with good

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods are common in small Mediterranean watersheds and the alerts
   provided by real-time monitoring systems provide too short anticipation
   times to warn the population. In this context, there is a strong need to
   develop flood forecasting systems in particular for developing countries
   such as Morocco where floods have severe socio-economic impacts. In this
   study, the AROME (Application of Research to Operations at Mesoscale),
   ALADIN (Aire Limited Dynamic Adaptation International Development) and
   WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) meteorological models are
   evaluated to forecast flood events in the Rheraya and Ourika basin
   located in the High-Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The model evaluation is
   performed by comparing for a set of flood events the observed and
   simulated probabilities of exceedances for different precipitation
   thresholds. In addition, two different flood forecasting approaches are
   compared: the first one relies on the coupling of meteorological
   forecasts with a hydrological model and the second one is a based on a
   linear relationship between event rainfall, antecedent soil moisture and
   runoff. Three different soil moisture products (in-situ measurements,
   European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative ESA-CCI remote sensing
   data and ERA5 reanalysis) are compared to estimate the initial soil
   moisture conditions before flood events for both methods. Results showed
   that the WRF and AROME models better simulate precipitation amounts
   compared to ALADIN, indicating the added value of convection-permitting
   models. The regression -based flood forecasting method outperforms the
   hydrological model-based approach, and the maximum discharge is better
   reproduced when using the WRF forecasts in combination with ERA5. These
   results provide insights to implement robust flood forecasting
   approaches in the context of data scarcity that could be valuable for
   developing countries such as Morocco and other North African countries.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed considerable developments in multiple fields
   with the potential to enhance our capability of forecasting pluvial
   flash floods, one of the most costly environmental hazards in terms of
   both property damage and loss of life. This work provides a summary and
   description of recent advances related to insights on atmospheric
   conditions that precede extreme rainfall events, to the development of
   monitoring systems of relevant hydrometeorological parameters, and to
   the operational adoption of weather and hydrological models towards the
   prediction of flash floods. With the exponential increase of available
   data and computational power, most of the efforts are being directed
   towards the improvement of multi-source data blending and assimilation
   techniques, as well as assembling approaches for uncertainty estimation.
   For urban environments, in which the need for high-resolution
   simulations demands computationally expensive systems, query-based
   approaches have been explored for the timely retrieval of pre-simulated
   flood inundation forecasts. Within the concept of the Internet of
   Things, the extensive deployment of low-cost sensors opens opportunities
   from the perspective of denser monitoring capabilities. However,
   different environmental conditions and uneven distribution of data and
   resources usually leads to the adoption of site-specific solutions for
   flash flood forecasting in the context of early warning systems.}},

Title = {{Leveraging machine learning for predicting flash flood damage in the
   Southeast US}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Flash flood is a recurrent natural hazard with substantial impacts in
   the Southeast US (SEUS) due to the frequent torrential rainfalls that
   occur in the region, which are triggered by tropical storms,
   thunderstorms, and hurricanes. Flash floods are costly natural hazards,
   primarily due to their rapid onset. Therefore, predicting property
   damage of flash floods is imperative for proactive disaster management.
   Here, we present a systematic framework that considers a variety of
   features explaining different components of risk (i.e. hazard,
   vulnerability, and exposure), and examine multiple machine learning
   methods to predict flash flood damage. A large database of flash flood
   events consisting of more than 14 000 events are assessed for training
   and testing the methodology, while a multitude of data sources are
   utilized to acquire reliable information related to each event. A
   variable selection approach was employed to alleviate the complexity of
   the dataset and facilitate the model development process. The random
   forest (RF) method was then used to map the identified input covariates
   to a target variable (i.e. property damage). The RF model was
   implemented in two modes: first, as a binary classifier to estimate if a
   region of interest was damaged in any particular flood event, and then
   as a regression model to predict the amount of property damage
   associated with each event. The results indicate that the proposed
   approach is successful not only for classifying damaging events (with an
   accuracy of 81\%), but also for predicting flash flood damage with a
   good agreement with the observed property damage. This study is among
   the few efforts for predicting flash flood damage across a large domain
   using mesoscale input variables, and the findings demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces an unprecedented flash flood that resulted in nine
   casualties in Shimen Valley, China, 2015. Through field survey and
   numerical simulation the causes of the disaster are systematically
   analyzed, finding that the intense storm, terrain features, and the
   large woody debris (LWD) played important roles. The intense storm
   induced fast runoff and, in turn, high discharges as a result of the
   steep catchment surfaces and channels. The flood flushed LWD and
   boulders downstream until blockage occurred in a contraction section,
   forming a debris lake. When the debris dam broke, a dam break wave
   rapidly propagated to the valley mouth, washing people away. After
   considering the disaster-inducing factors, measures for preventing
   similar floods are proposed. The analysis presented herein should help
   others manage flash floods in mountain areas.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme storms and
   flash floods, which could be more damaging under climate change. This
   study presented an integrated framework for assessing climate change
   impact on extreme rainfall and urban drainage systems by incorporating a
   number of statistical and modelling techniques. Starting from synthetic
   future climate data generated by the stochastic weather generator, the
   simple scaling method and the Huff rainfall design were adopted for
   rainfall disaggregation and rainfall design. After having obtained 3-min
   level designed rainfall information, the urban hydrological model (i.e.,
   Storm Water Management Model) was used to carry out the runoff analysis.
   A case study in a tropical city was used to demonstrate the proposed
   framework. Particularly, the impact of selecting different general
   circulation models and Huff distributions on future 1-h extreme rainfall
   and the performance of the urban drainage system were investigated. It
   was revealed that the proposed framework is flexible and easy to
   implement in generating temporally high-resolution rainfall data under
   climate model projections and offers a parsimonious way of assessing
   urban flood risks considering the uncertainty arising from climate
   change model projections, downscaling and rainfall design.}},

Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{2493-2509}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Short-duration precipitation extremes are widely used in the design of
   engineering infrastructure systems and they also lead to high impact
   flash flood events and landslides. Better understanding of these events
   in a changing climate is therefore critical. This study assesses
   characteristics of short-duration precipitation extremes of 1-, 3-, 6-
   and 12-h durations in terms of the precipitation-temperature (P-T)
   relationship in current and future climates for ten Canadian climatic
   regions using the limited area version of the global environment
   multiscale (GEM) model. The GEM simulations, driven by ERA-Interim
   reanalysis and two coupled global climate models (CanESM2 and MPI-ESM),
   reproduce the general observed regional P-T relationship characteristics
   in current climate (1981-2010), such as sub-CC (Clausius-Clapeyron) and
   CC scalings for the coastal and northern, and inland regions,
   respectively, albeit with some underestimation. Analysis of the
   transient climate change simulations suggests important shifts and/or
   extensions of the P-T curve to higher temperature bins in future climate
   (2071-2100) for RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, particularly for 1-h duration.
   Analysis of the spatial patterns of dew point depression (temperature
   minus dew point temperature) and convective available potential energy
   (CAPE) corresponding to short-duration precipitation extremes for
   different temperature bins show their changing relative importance from
   low to high temperature bins. For the low-temperature bins,
   short-duration precipitation extremes are largely due to high relative
   humidity, while for high-temperature bins, strong convection due to
   atmospheric instability brought by surface warming is largely
   responsible. The analysis thus addresses some of the key knowledge gaps
   related to the behavior of P-T relationship and associated mechanisms
   for the Canadian regions.}},

Title = {{Assessing Nature-Based and Classical Engineering Solutions for
   Flood-Risk Reduction in Urban Streams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization of stream ecosystems with the purpose of managing the
   flash-flood events is nowadays considered responsible for habitat loss
   and alteration of the natural flow regime with severe implications for
   the ecosystem functioning. Unsurprisingly, the river scientists have
   started seeking alternative options inspired from nature for mitigating
   the flood-risk and maintaining the stream at its natural state. With
   this article the authors demonstrate the effects of a nature-based
   solution (NBS) for managing an urban stream based on the use of
   bioengineering materials (e.g. plants) and the implementation of the
   actions that restore the stream to its natural form (e.g channel
   widening). The HEC-RAS software was employed to simulate the flow and
   hydraulic components of an approximately 800m long reach of an urban
   stream under three different scenarios of flood risk management with a
   design flow set to 400 m(3)/s. The first scenario was based on the
   current situation of the stream, the second scenario concerned the
   stream restoration by following the nature-based solutions, while the
   third scenario was based on the classical ``grey{''} engineering
   approach of concrete channelization. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
   photogrammetry methods and the Pix4Dmapper software were used in order
   to develop a detailed 3D model of the studied reach that accurately
   captured the current geomorphology. The obtained results showed that
   with concrete channelization, the average and maximum flow of the stream
   increases significantly in relation to the current situation, from 2.48
   and 4.88m/s to 9.82 and 11.22 m/s, respectively, while the average
   Froude number raises from 0.36 to 1.69 implying super-critical flows. In
   contrast, the NBS scenario retained lower flow velocities and average
   Froude number similar to those under the current conditions. In
   addition, a cost estimation analysis for both stream management
   techniques revealed that the NBS is much cheaper than the traditional
   channelization (1.1 mil (sic) vs 5.6 mil (sic)). In conclusion, our
   findings suggest that the future restoration of urban streams should
   consider the nature-based solutions since i) they can be effective with
   regard to the reduction of flood-risk, ii) are cheaper than the
   traditional ``grey{''} techniques and, most importantly, iii) maintain
   the natural state of the ecosystem which improves not only the ecosystem
   functioning but also the aesthetic value within the urban context.}},

Abstract = {{High magnitude flash flood has occurred several times in some areas in
   Central Sulawesi Province after the 2018 Palu Earthquake, one of them is
   in the Bangga River, Sigi Regency, Indonesia. It has caused massive
   impacts such as damaging agricultural and plantation areas and
   submerging public facilities and infrastructure and even causing
   fatalities. The flood carries a variety of materials, especially high
   concentration sediments which are thought to originate from eroded soils
   due to landslides induced by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. These materials
   are eroded and transported by the flow at the upstream watershed due to
   heavy rainfall. This study intends to investigate the potential of
   landslides, factors that trigger floods and increased flooding after the
   earthquake. This research was conducted by investigating the landslides
   potency based on field surveys and interpretation of the latest
   satellite imagery, analyzing the characteristics of rainfall as a
   trigger for flooding, and predicting the flood potency as the primary
   impact of these two factors. Rainfall-flood transformation was simulated
   with the HEC-HMS Model, one of the freeware semi-distributed models
   commonly used in hydrological analysis. The model input is the
   configuration of river networks generated from the National DEM
   (DEMNAS), hourly rainfall during floods and other watershed parameters
   such as land cover, soil types and river slope. The similar simulation
   was also carried out on the condition of the watershed before the
   earthquake. Based on the results of the analysis, It can be inferred
   that flash floods in the Bangga River are mainly caused by heavy
   rainfall with long duration and landslide areas in the upper watershed
   triggered by the 2018 Palu Earthquake with an area of approximately 10.8
   km(2). The greatest depth of rainfall as a trigger for flooding is 30.4
   mm with a duration of 8 hours. The results of the study also showed that
   landslides in the upper watershed could increase the peak flood by
   33.33\% from 118.56 m(3)/s to 158.08 m(3)/s for conditions before and
   after the earthquake.}},

   and Its Cascading Hydrological Response? A Case Study of Hurricane
   Harvey Using EF5 Modeling Framework}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{A new generation of precipitation measurement products has emerged, and
   their performances have gained much attention from the scientific
   community, such as the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor system (MRMS) from the
   National Severe Storm Laboratory (NSSL) and the Global Precipitation
   Measurement Mission (GPM) from the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration (NASA). This study statistically evaluated the MRMS and
   GPM products and investigated their cascading hydrological response in
   August of 2017, when Hurricane Harvey brought historical and
   record-breaking precipitation to the Gulf Coast (>1500 mm), causing 107
   fatalities along with about USD 125 billion worth of damage. Rain-gauge
   observations from Harris County Flood Control District (HCFCD) and
   stream-gauge measurements by the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
   were used as ground truths to evaluate MRMS, GPM and National Centers
   for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) gauge-only data by using statistical
   metrics and hydrological simulations using the Ensemble Framework for
   Flash Flooding Forecast (EF5) model. The results indicate that remote
   sensing technologies can accurately detect and estimate the
   unprecedented precipitation event with their near-real-time products,
   and all precipitation products produced good hydrological simulations,
   where the Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency coefficients (NSCE) were close
   to 0.9 for both the MRMS and GPM products. With the timeliness and
   seamless coverage of MRMS and GPM, the study also demonstrated the
   capability and efficiency of the EF5 framework for flash flood modeling
   over the United States and potentially additional international domains.}},

Title = {{Comparison analysis of six purely satellite-derived global precipitation
   estimates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{581}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We executed a comprehensive evaluation and intercomparison between six
   purely satellite-derived precipitation estimates (i.e., IMERG-Late,
   IMERG-Early, GSMaP-NRT, GSMaP-MVK, TMPA-RT and PERSIANN-CCS) at global
   and regional scales for the period from February 2017 to January 2019.
   The results show that IMERG-Late exhibits the best performance among six
   evaluated products, while the worst performance was found in GSMaP-NRT
   and GSMaP-MVK. The root mean squared error (RMSE) has a power function
   to the logarithm of precipitation intensity in all six satellite
   products. On the basis of our findings, the RMSE of all products in
   rainfall events with intensity exceeding 32 mm/day (or 8 mm/h) accounts
   for beyond 30\% of the corresponding precipitation intensity, which
   might result in a significant impact on the detectability and forecast
   of flash floods simulated by satellite precipitation. Additionally, both
   IMERG and GSMaP overestimate the proportions of light rainfall
   occurrences, and also display relatively larger errors in light
   precipitation (0.2-0.4 mm/h or 1-2 mm/day) with the RMSE values
   exceeding 0.5 mm (or 2 mm) at hourly (or daily) time scale. As for the
   error analysis, we decomposed the total bias of each product into hits,
   misses and false biases at hourly and 0.1 degrees resolution over
   mainland China except for TMPA-RT. We found that the false bias is the
   dominated error sources for these five products in cold season over
   semi-humid areas despite that the hit bias accounts for a non-negligible
   proportion for GSMaP suite. The missed precipitation is the dominated
   error sources of PERSIANN-CCS both in two seasons over most of humid
   regions, and meanwhile is one of major error sources for other four
   products. We expect that the findings of this study not only provide
   some valuable feedbacks for algorithm developers to improve the
   GPM-based satellite precipitation retrievals, but also provide some
   guidance for data users across the world.}},

Title = {{Providing guidance on efficient flash flood documentation: an
   application based approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{581}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Flash flood research crucially relies on historical event information
   for hypothesis testing. However, flash flood science suffers from data
   scarcity. Due to the high effort for event data collection, few
   long-term and comprehensive flash flood datasets exist. Yet, to advance
   flash flood research, scientists should spend time on creating event
   datasets. Therefore, to reduce the data collection and preparation
   effort, this paper takes a first step towards structuring the flash
   flood documentation procedure. In this context, we first investigate the
   current documentation approaches by reviewing 11 published flash flood
   datasets. We found great differences between the flash flood datasets
   regarding temporal and spatial scope, information density, flash flood
   definition, and usability by others. Based on the review findings and
   the cross-industry standard process for data mining, we propose a
   structured 4-step approach for flash flood documentation. We provide
   recommendations on efficient flash flood documentation and exemplify a
   possible implementation based on a German flash flood dataset, starting
   from flash flood definition through the identification of sources to the
   schematic event documentation. The key feature of our approach is a
   documentation scheme specifying what event information to report and
   how. Within the documentation scheme, it proved particularly helpful to
   use fixed categories for attribute description, to rate information
   quality, and to document events separated by source. Following our
   approach, we were able to create a comprehensive event dataset composed
   of a variety of sources. In addition to flash flood events, our dataset
   also includes surface runoff events triggered by heavy rain, adding up
   to nearly 23,800 German events. Scientists can employ this approach to
   document flash floods more efficiently in the future.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{581}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This study proposed and compared several novel hybrid models that
   combined swarm intelligence algorithms and Deep Learning Neural Network
   for flood susceptibility mapping. Lai Chau, a province in the northwest
   mountainous region of Vietnam was chosen as a case study since it had
   recently undergone severe flashflood in 2018. For this purpose,
   numerical predictor variables such as topographically derived factors
   (Digital Elevation Model, Aspect, Slope, Curvature, Topographic Wetness
   Index), climatic variables (Rain), and hydrological variables (stream
   density, stream power index, distance to river) and multiple remote
   sensing indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized
   Difference Buildup Index) were used. These predictor variables were
   selected because they are globally collectible and reproducible. The
   performances of these models were evaluated by using common statistical
   indicators, namely Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Overall
   Accuracy and Area under Receiving Operating Characteristics, and the
   statistical test of differences. The results showed that the proposed
   swarm intelligence models outperformed benchmarked methods, namely
   Particle Swarm Optimization, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest in
   almost all comparing indicators. It is suggested that proposed models
   are more robust than the classifiers, which were used for benchmarking
   and they are good alternatives for flood susceptibility mapping given
   the availability of dataset.}},

Abstract = {{This study used a simulation methodology for dam break analysis and
   flood simulation in an urbanized arid region, namely Um Al-Khair dam in
   Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The analysis was performed using the 2011 rainfall
   storm of 111 mm and 281 min duration. The results show that the rainfall
   depth corresponds to a return period between 50 and 100 years. The
   hydrograph resulting from this storm was estimated using a
   rainfall-runoff model. The hydrograph was found to fall in between 100-
   and 200-years return period. This confirms that it is not necessarily to
   have the same return period for both rainfall and its corresponding
   flood due to the nonlinearity of the rainfall-runoff process. The dam
   breach parameters and the inflow hydrograph were used to model the flood
   propagation due to Um Al-Khair dam breach using HEC-RAS-2D software. A
   comparison between the modeled and observed water depths showed a
   relatively reasonable correlation coefficient of 0.57 and the RMSE of
   the water depth is 0.45 m, which are acceptable in such studies under
   the scarcity of accurate field measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The intermittent dry spells during growing season of winter or sali
   rice, cultivated in NBPZ of Assam located in the foothills of Eastern
   Himalayan region, is a major weather risk causing widespread damage to
   the crop. Herein, variability of rainfall in Lakhimpur district situated
   in NBPZ was studied. A significant decreasing trend of annual and
   seasonal rainfall was observed. Significant decrease in monsoon rainfall
   and increase in monthly rainfall variability clearly explains the recent
   rainfall fluctuations with increasing frequency of intermittent dry
   spells and flash floods. A participatory evaluation trial was conducted
   in Chamua village of Lakhimpur district having different land situations
   to identify climate resilient technologies to cope with seasonal drought
   in sali rice. High-yielding short-duration varieties, viz., Dishang,
   Luit, Lachit and Kolong, and medium-duration varieties, viz.,
   Basundhara, Mohan, Mulagabhoru and TTB-404 performed consistently better
   than the long-duration HYV or the traditional varieties under upland and
   medium land situations, respectively. Though the effect of dry spells on
   long-duration varieties cultivated on low lands was least, yield of
   these varieties reduced up to 43.07\% when sowing was delayed beyond
   23rd of June. Performance of the delayed sown varieties was further
   declined, when exposed to dry spells at later growth stages. However,
   adverse impact of dry spells can be managed effectively by replacing
   farmers' varieties with short and medium-duration high-yielding
   varieties in upland and medium lands, respectively, and manipulating
   sowing time of long-duration varieties for low lands.}},

Title = {{A 45 kyr laminae record from the Dead Sea: Implications for basin
   erosion and floods recurrence}},
Journal = {{QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{229}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Recording and analyzing how climate change impacts flood recurrence,
   basin erosion, and sedimentation can improve our understanding of these
   systems. The aragonite-detritus laminae couplets comprising the
   lacustrine formations that were deposited in the Dead Sea are considered
   as faithful monitors of the freshwater supply to the lakes. We count a
   total of -5600 laminae couplets deposited in the last 45 kyr (MIS3-MIS1)
   at the Dead Sea center, which encompass the upper 142 m of the ICDP Core
   5017-1. The present study shows that aragonite and detritus laminae are
   thinner and occur at high frequency during MIS 3-2, while they are much
   thicker and less frequent during MIS 1. By analyzing multiple
   climateconnected factors, we propose that significant lake-level drops,
   enhanced dust input, and low vegetative cover in the drainage basin
   during the last deglaciation (22-11.6 ka) have considerably increased
   erodible materials in the Dead Sea watershed. We find a decoupling
   existed between the significant lakelevel drop/lake size reduction and
   lamina thickness change during the last deglaciation. We argue that
   during the Last Glacial and the Holocene, the variation of lamina
   thickness at the multiple-millennium scale was not controlled directly
   by the lake-level/size change. We interpret this decoupling implying the
   transport capacity of flash-floods is low and might be saturated by the
   oversupply of erodible materials, and indicating a transport-limited
   regime during the time period. We suggest the observed thickness and
   frequency distribution of aragonite-detritus laminae points to the high
   frequency of small magnitude floods during the Last Glacial, in contrast
   to low frequency, but large -magnitude floods during the Holocene. (C)

Title = {{Multiscale analysis of a record-breaking heavy rainfall event in
   Guangdong, China}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{232}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{An extremely heavy rainfall event hit eastern Guangdong province, China
   on 30 August 2018, during which Gaotan station observed a
   record-breaking 1056.7 mm of precipitation in a 24-h period. Using
   analysis data, observations from soundings, automatic weather stations
   and radar, as well as a Lagrangian model, the multiscale characteristics
   of this record-breaking rainfall event are investigated, including
   large-scale forcing, moisture transport, mesoscale circulations, and
   microphysical features. The monsoon depression near the Indo-China
   Peninsula and the Beibu Gulf played an important role in sustaining the
   moisture supply from main source regions of the Arabian Sea, the Bay of
   Bengal and the South China Sea. The low-level winds turned from
   southwesterly to southerly-southeasterly, favoring back-building
   processes mainly due to orographic lifting by the southwest-northeast
   oriented Mt. Lianhua. The repeated formation and maintenance of
   rainbands along Mt. Lianhua, which were attributable to the
   back-building processes, local convergence near Gaotan, and the high
   terrain to the northeast of Gaotan, accounted for the extremely heavy
   rainfall over Gaotan. Graupel dominated above the freezing level over
   Gaotan during the period of intense precipitation, suggesting that
   riming and melting processes were vital contributors to the surface
   heavy rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{Debris flow events, generated by surface runoff, occur with great
   frequency in the Dolomites (Northeastern Italian Alps) during the summer
   season. Summer thunderstorms, which are common in the region, can
   quickly generate runoff at the base of rocky cliffs, which then entrains
   and propagates downstream the underlying unconsolidated material. In the
   past, the main atmospheric feature considered in evaluating the
   initiation of debris flow events was rainfall. Observations led to the
   development of rainfall intensity-duration thresholds for sediment
   mobilization, which compared incoming severe rainfalls with the
   potential for triggering debris flows. This study works toward the
   examination of another characteristic of the atmosphere, the atmospheric
   electric field. In particular, the behavior of the electric field prior
   to convective rainfall is investigated as an indicator of rainfall
   intensities capable of triggering debris flows, in a basin near Cortina
   d'Ampezzo (Italy). Results suggest that prior to bursts of intense
   rainfall, the electric field derivative frequency distribution exhibits
   a recurrent pattern roughly half the time. When it occurs, the amplitude
   of derivative frequency distribution intersects the zero axis twice
   before rainfall reaches maximum intensity. A regression model is
   designed which considers the amplitude maximum and the difference in
   time between the crossings of the zero axis. The validation of this
   model suggests a mild relationship between electric field and rainfall
   intensity in an alpine environment.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-criteria method is a widely used technique to study and
   analyze the impact and causes of natural hazards. Our study area, that
   forms a part of the governorate of Sohag, lies in Southeast Sohag and is
   one of the most flash flood prone regions of Egypt's Eastern Desert. In
   the last decades, this area of Sohag has suffered from frequent flash
   floods, with some flood events resulting in human casualties. In our
   study, we use a multi-criteria process combined with geographical
   information system (GIS) and remotely sensed data to produce a flash
   flood susceptibility map. In addition, we discuss the various factors
   related to flash flooding such as elevation, slope, drainage network,
   lithology, topographic wetness index, as well as land use, and
   reclassify these based on their contribution and their effect on flood
   probability. To calculate the weighted factor for each raster, a
   pairwise matrix was constructed. Results from our multi-criteria
   analysis for flash flooding indicate that approximately 5\% of the total
   study area is at a very high risk of flooding, 10\% at a high risk, and
   25\% at a moderate flood risk. Furthermore, our results highlight the
   areas at risk of flooding and the need for the development of relevant
   warning systems. Our results also indicate that the southeastern part of
   the study area is most susceptible to flash floods and we suggest that
   the necessary focus be given to this region as well as the
   implementation of a flood warning system. A consistency index was used
   to determine the accuracy of our model and was calculated to be 0.058,
   indicating a well-performing model.}},

Title = {{Potential release of legacy nitrogen from soil surrounding onsite
   wastewater leaching pools}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{169}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{This study examined whether the accumulation of nitrogen (legacy
   nitrogen) within and surrounding leaching pools for onsite wastewater
   treatment may act as a source of nitrogen contamination to groundwater
   upon changes to the quantity and/or composition of the influent to the
   pool. In this study, one concrete leaching pool with neutral pH (A, pH
   6.9) and one leaching pool after acid washing (B, pH 3.7) were selected
   to examine the quantity and composition of legacy nitrogen in the
   surrounding soil, as well as evaluate the potential release of this
   nitrogen under two environmentally relevant leaching scenarios: (i) the
   concrete leaching pool serves as the final discharge unit for aerobic
   treatment unit (ATU) effluent; (ii) extreme weather events (flash
   flood/heavy rains) act to increase the quantity and dilute the
   composition of flow to the pool. Core sample analysis showed that
   organic nitrogen accounts for the majority (97.3-99.7\%) of the total
   nitrogen (TN) at site A (4.1 +/- 0.6 mg N/g soil) and site B (3.0 +/-
   0.4 mg N/g soil); while ammonium was the major form of inorganic
   nitrogen present at the sites. The TN accumulated under the two leaching
   pools was equivalent to approximately 17-39 days of nitrogen loading to
   the system. pH had a significant impact on the mass of TN leached from
   the soil, while no significant difference in leached TN was observed for
   the two leaching scenarios. The amount of TN leached from the soil
   matrix was not affected by the flow rate (18.6 mL/d in scenario i vs.
   547.2 mL/d in scenario ii) or flow pattern (intermittent dosing vs.
   continuous flow). The quantity of TN leached from soils in both scenario
   (i) and (ii) was low and accounted for 2.6-8.9\% of the total nitrogen
   in the soil. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   quasi-normal surface flow in rectangular channel coupled with vertical
   seepage: Vedernikov-Riesenkampfs legacy revisited}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{136}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Channels are widely used for conveying natural flash floods or managed
   aquifer recharge (MAR) released treated wastewater. Adequate models are
   needed for describing the interaction between hydraulics of surface flow
   downslope the channel and vertical seepage into a porous bed for
   evaluation of the depth of water and the length to which surface water
   ``jet{''} propagates over a porous bed. Experiments with surface
   ``jets{''} (consumed by bed infiltration) are compared with numerical
   and analytical modeling of these coupled flows. In the field (Al-Hail
   site, Oman), at a pedestal and slope of a dune, two rectangular trenches
   had a sand bed and a mild and steep slope S (3 degrees and 25 degrees,
   correspondingly). After applying constant discharges at the inlet of the
   trenches, the length, L, of the water ``jets{''} propagating until
   complete extinction has been measured. The wetting front into the
   subjacent sand has been detected by measuring the volumetric soil
   moisture content at different depths in an excavation, immediately after
   termination of discharging the surface water. Analytically (by the
   hodograph method), 2-D steady phreatic seepage flow from a rectangular
   channel was examined as a special case of Vedernikov's solution for a
   soil without capillarity. Since the depth of water was small, the
   Riesenkampf analytical solution, involving capillarity in the
   tension-saturated flanks of the channel, has been also utilized.
   Numerically, Richard's equation has been solved by a finite element
   method, HYDRUS2D for arbitrary soils. The boundary condition was a
   hydrostatic pressure head along the wetted perimeters of the channels
   with water depth gradually dropping downslope. Coupling of surface and
   subsurface flows has been done by the ``kinematic waves{''}
   approximation with Manning's friction slope equal to S. In the ODE for
   conservation of mass, the sink term (infiltration) was computed by
   either HYDRUS or analytical solution. The corresponding boundary value
   problem was solved by computer algebra routines.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a hydrologic assessment approach implemented in a
   safety-inspection methodology for river bridges in Turkey was developed
   in which various hydrologic indicators such as morphometric parameters,
   land cover and use, precipitation magnitude and type, flood history, and
   presence of retention structures were selected to assess hydrologic
   behavior and flash-flood potential of the bridge watershed. According to
   the proposed approach, hydrologic grading of the watersheds was
   performed by summing up the grades of the indicators and classifying the
   bridge watershed with regard to the flash-flood susceptibility of the
   bridge. This hydrologic assessment approach was applied to 10 river
   bridges in the Western Black Sea Basin in Turkey, where bridges are
   often affected by severe flash floods. It was found that the selected
   indicators encouragingly exhibited the flood potential and hydrologic
   behavior of the watersheds by comparing the grades of the bridges
   considered. So, hydrologic assessment could enable engineers to take
   necessary precautions against effects of flooding on river bridges both
   in design and operation stages. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil

Volume = {{148}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{597-612}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Mean daily to monthly precipitation averages peak in late July over
   eastern Colorado and some of the most damaging Front Range flash floods
   have occurred because of extreme 1-day rainfall events during this
   period. Tree-ring chronologies of adjusted latewood width in ponderosa
   pine from eastern Colorado are highly correlated with the highest 1-day
   rainfall totals occurring during this 2-week precipitation maximum in
   late July. A regional average of four adjusted latewood chronologies
   from eastern Colorado was used to reconstruct the single wettest day
   observed during the last two weeks of July. The regional chronology was
   calibrated with the CPC 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees Daily U.S. Unified
   Gauge-Based Analysis of Precipitation dataset and explains 65\% of the
   variance in the highest 1-day late July precipitation totals in the
   instrumental data from 1948 to 1997. The reconstruction and instrumental
   data extend fully from 1779 to 2019 and indicate that the frequency of
   1-day rainfall extremes in late July has increased since the late
   eighteenth century. The largest instrumental and reconstructed 1-day
   precipitation extremes are most commonly associated with the intrusion
   of a major frontal system into a deep layer of atmospheric moisture
   across eastern Colorado. These general synoptic conditions have been
   previously linked to extreme localized rainfall totals and widespread
   thunderstorm activity over Colorado during the summer season.
   Chronologies of adjusted latewood width in semiarid eastern Colorado
   constitute a proxy of weather time-scale rainfall events useful for
   investigations of long-term variability and for framing natural and
   potential anthropogenic forcing of precipitation extremes during this
   2-week precipitation maximum in a long historical perspective.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods are the highest sediment transporting agent, but are
   inaccessible for in-situ sampling and have rarely been analyzed by
   remote sensing technology. Laboratory and field experiments were done to
   develop linear spectral unmixing (LSU) remote sensing model and evaluate
   its performance in simulating the suspended sediment concentration (SSC)
   in flash floods. The models were developed from continuous monitoring in
   the laboratory and the onsite spectral signature of river bed sediment
   deposits and flash floods in the Tekeze River and in its tributary, the
   Tsirare River. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine
   the variability of correlations between reflectance and SSCs. The
   coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square of error (RMSE)
   were used to evaluate the performance of the generated models. The
   results found that the Pearson correlation coefficient between SSCs and
   reflectance varied based on the level of the SSCs, geological colors,
   and grain sizes. The performance of the LSU model and empirical remote
   sensing approaches were computed to be R2 = 0.92, and RMSE = +/- 0.76
   g/l in the Tsirare River and R2 = 0.91, and RMSE = +/- 0.73 g/l in the
   Tekeze River and R2 = 0.81, RMSE = +/- 2.65 g/l in the Tsirare river and
   R2 = 0.76, RMSE = +/- 10.87 g/l in the Tekeze River, respectively.
   Hence, the LSU approach of remote sensing was found to be relatively
   accurate in monitoring and modeling the variability of SSCs that could
   be applied to the upper Tekeze River basin. (C) 2019 International

Abstract = {{Soil and water conservation measures such as vegetation cover and
   terraces effectively reduce runoff and sediment yield. However, there is
   little information available on how vegetation cover and terraces affect
   peak flow under extreme rainstorm conditions. The purpose of this study
   was to investigate the effect of vegetation cover and terraces on peak
   flow rate in small catchments under ``7.26{''} extreme rainstorm
   conditions on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Thirty-two small watersheds
   located in Chabagou Watershed, Zizhou County, Shaanxi Province, were
   selected. The watershed areas ranged from 0.03 to 1.55 km(2). An aerial
   image with a resolution of 0.2 m was used to determine the land use and
   engineering practice by means of visual interpretation. The
   cross-section at the watershed outlets were investigated. At each
   cross-section, the flow depth, cross-sectional area of flow, wetted
   perimeter, and slope gradient of the channel were measured. Then, flow
   velocity was calculated using Manning's equation. Peak flow rate was
   calculated based on flow velocity and cross-sectional area of flow. The
   results showed that peak flow rates varied from 0.35 to 79.89 m(3)/s.
   Unit flood peak ranged from 4.3 to 153.0 m(3)/(km(2)center dot s). Peak
   flow rate was significantly correlated with watershed area, main channel
   length of the watershed, mean slope gradient of the watershed, and area
   percentage of the grassland at p < 0.01. The unit flood peak in the
   grassland and woodland decreased by 36\% and 64\%, respectively,
   compared with that in the watershed with the largest cropland component.
   Terraces reduced the unit flood peaks in the farmland and grassland by
   48\% and 39\%, respectively. Thus, vegetation cover and terraces
   effectively reduced peak flow rate, and the susceptibility of the
   sampled watersheds to flood generation was evaluated as ``average''
   under extreme storm conditions. Our findings indicate that vegetation
   cover and terraces play an important role in soil conservation onsite
   and flood safety offsite under extreme rainstorm conditions.}},

Title = {{AI based mechanistic modeling and probabilistic forecasting of hybrid
   low salinity chemical flooding}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{261}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decades, it has been widely shown that Low Salinity
   Waterflooding (LSW) outperformed High Salinity Waterflooding (HSW) in
   terms of higher oil recovery, particularly in combining with other
   conventional Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods such as chemical
   flooding to benefit from their synergies. This paper presents a novel
   approach to mechanistically model Hybrid Low Salinity Chemical Flooding,
   with: (1) development of a hybrid EOR concept from past decades; (2)
   utilizing a Multilayer Neural Network (ML-NN) artificial intelligent
   technique in a robust Equation-of-State reservoir simulator fully
   coupled with geochemistry; (3) systematic validation with laboratory
   data; and (4) uncertainty assessment of the LSW process at the field
   scale.
   Various parameters such as polymer, surfactant, and salinity can affect
   on the relative permeability simultaneously during hybrid recovery
   processes. To overcome this problem, the ML-NN technique was applied for
   multidimensional interpolation of the relative permeability.
   Additionally, ML-NN was used within a Bayesian workflow to capture the
   uncertainties in both history matching and forecasting stages of LSW at
   field scale. The proposed model indicated good agreements with various
   coreflooding experiments including HSW, LSW, and Low Salinity Surfactant
   flooding (LSS), where it can efficiently capture the complex
   geochemistry, wettability alteration, microemulsion phase behavior, and
   the synergies occurring in these hybrid processes.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The Yandafero spate irrigation system, both traditional and modern, has
   experienced community floodwater management for the last 25 years.
   However, most of the intakes were severely damaged by high flood. The
   weak relationship between governmental organization and water users,
   absence of policy and institutional structure for operation and
   maintenance, result conflicts on water sharing at upstream and
   downstream, then lead to collapse or dysfunctional of scheme. Hence, the
   study was conducted to evaluate the existing performance of
   institutional setup concerning operation and maintenance, water sharing
   and conflict management, provision of self-finance and performance
   impacts on agricultural productivity and recommendation that build
   strengths and address limitations of current institutions for better
   spate flow management in Yandafero-Konso lowland. Primary data including
   socio-economic data like household income were collected through a
   household survey and questionnaires. Interview, focus group discussion
   and field visit were employed to understand operational and maintenance
   activities. Grey literature and documents were also used to realize the
   general description and role of organizations in Yandafero spate system.
   Then five principals: right to organize, operation and maintenance of
   infrastructure, water sharing dynamics, conflict resolution mechanism
   and facilities for self-finance were developed to evaluate the existing
   institutional arrangement. As the study showed that farmers were
   organized under formal and informal Irrigation Water User Cooperative
   (IWUC), out of the nine proposed IWUCs, only three of them got the right
   to be organized with clearly stated (written) responsibilities. Oneya
   and Potota sub-schemes were with poor status of diversion weir such as
   damaging of headwork, barred gate, malfunction of flood flash that
   results in high accumulation of sediment on the weir. Though water
   rights and distribution rule were similarly established among three
   schemes, their performance was varying. In Potota sub-scheme, negligence
   of enforcement of water distribution regulation and codification was
   experienced compared to Oneya (56.7\%) and Tarakoma (43.3\%). There was
   good performance of IWUC at Oneya and Tarakoma sub-schemes regarding the
   construction irrigation canals and ensuring equal floodwater
   distribution. Conflict resolution mechanism was established only at
   Oneya and Tarakoma sub-schemes. Farmers practiced credit and loan
   facilities for self-finance through formal cooperative mechanisms. In
   Potota sub-scheme, the average annual production before and after the
   improvement of diversion weir was the same (< 1000 kg per annual),
   whereas dramatic increment was witnessed at Oneya and Tarakoma (> 4000
   kg per annual).}},

Abstract = {{Private risk reduction behaviours can significantly reduce the negative
   impacts of flooding and flash floods. Over the past decades, researchers
   have used various socio-cognitive models or threat and coping mechanisms
   to explain individual protective behaviours. However, these models
   ignore the fact that people are not equally ready to act upon a danger,
   and they (the models) give limited insights into the effectiveness of
   communication strategies to foster risk reduction behaviours. Therefore,
   we explored the current state of homeowners' readiness to undertake risk
   reduction behaviours in flood risk areas by applying a dynamic
   protection motivation framework. We conducted a survey in an Italian
   municipality that experienced severe flash flooding in September 2018.
   The results show that people are motivated by different factors in
   prompting risk reduction behaviour based on their chosen types of
   protective measures. For example, people that undertook structural or
   avoidance measures are more likely to be motivated to protect themselves
   by increased perceptions of vulnerability and response efficacy and are
   less worried about expected flood losses compared to people that
   undertook only basic emergency measures. In this paper, we argue how
   these new insights contribute to targeting flood risk communication
   strategies to groups of individuals characterized by different readiness
   stages and motivations to protect themselves.}},

Title = {{Impact of high-resolution sea surface temperature representation on the
   forecast of small Mediterranean catchments' hydrological responses to
   heavy precipitation}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{269-291}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Operational meteo-hydrological forecasting chains are affected by many
   sources of uncertainty. In coastal areas characterized by complex
   topography, with several medium-to-small size catchments, quantitative
   precipitation forecast becomes even more challenging due to the
   interaction of intense air-sea exchanges with coastal orography. For
   such areas, which are quite common in the Mediterranean Basin, improved
   representation of sea surface temperature (SST) space-time patterns can
   be particularly important. The paper focuses on the relative impact of
   different resolutions of SST representation on regional operational
   forecasting chains (up to river discharge estimates) over coastal
   Mediterranean catchments, with respect to two other fundamental options
   while setting up the system, i.e. the choice of the forcing general
   circulation model (GCM) and the possible use of a three-dimensional
   variational assimilation (3D-Var) scheme. Two different kinds of severe
   hydro-meteorological events that affected the Calabria region (southern
   Italy) in 2015 are analysed using the WRF-Hydro atmosphere-hydrology
   modelling system in its uncoupled version. Both of the events are
   modelled using the 0.25 degrees resolution global forecasting system
   (GFS) and the 16 km resolution integrated forecasting system (IFS)
   initial and lateral atmospheric boundary conditions, which are from the
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), applying the
   WRF mesoscale model for the dynamical downscaling. For the IFS-driven
   forecasts, the effects of the 3D-Var scheme are also analysed. Finally,
   native initial and lower boundary SST data are replaced with data from
   the Medspiration project by Institut Francais de Recherche pour
   L'Exploitation de la Mer (IFRE-MER)/Centre European Remote Sensing
   d'Archivage et de Traitement (CERSAT), which have a 24 h time resolution
   and a 2.2 km spatial resolution. Precipitation estimates are compared
   with both ground-based and radar data, as well as discharge estimates
   with stream gauging stations' data. Overall, the experiments highlight
   that the added value of high-resolution SST representation can be hidden
   by other more relevant sources of uncertainty, especially the choice of
   the general circulation model providing the boundary conditions.
   Nevertheless, in most cases, high-resolution SST fields show a
   non-negligible impact on the simulation of the atmospheric boundary
   layer processes, modifying flow dynamics and/or the amount of
   precipitated water; thus, this emphasizes the fact that uncertainty in
   SST representation should be duly taken into account in operational
   forecasting in coastal areas.}},

Title = {{Modeling the effects of sediment concentration on the propagation of
   flash floods in an Andean watershed}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{221-241}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Rain-induced flash floods are common events in regions near mountain
   ranges. In peri-urban areas near the Andes the combined effects of the
   changing climate and El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have resulted
   in an alarming proximity of populated areas to flood-prone streams,
   increasing the risk for cities and infrastructure. Simulations of rapid
   floods in these watersheds are particularly challenging, due to the
   complex morphology, the insufficient hydrometeorological data, and the
   uncertainty posed by the variability of sediment concentration. High
   concentrations produced by hillslope erosion and rilling by the overland
   flow in areas with steep slopes and low vegetational covering can
   significantly change the dynamics of the flow as the flood propagates in
   the channel. In this investigation, we develop a two-dimensional
   finite-volume numerical model of the nonlinear shallow water equations
   coupled with the mass conservation of sediment to study the effects of
   different densities, which include a modified version of the quadratic
   stress model to quantify the changes in the flow rheology. We carry out
   simulations to evaluate the effects of the sediment concentration on the
   floods in the Quebrada de Ramon watershed, a peri-urban Andean basin in
   central Chile. We simulate a confluence and a total length of the
   channel of 10.4 km, with the same water hydrographs and different
   combinations of sediment concentrations in the tributaries. Our results
   show that the sediment concentration has strong impacts on flow
   velocities and water depths. Compared to clearwater flow, the wave-front
   velocity slows down more than 70 \% for floods with a volumetric
   concentration of 60 \% and the total flooded area is 36 \% larger when
   the sediment concentration is equal to 20 \%. The maximum flow momentum
   at cross sections in the urban area increases 14.5 \% on average when
   the mean concentration along the main channel changes from 30 \% to 44
   \%. Simulations also show that other variables such as the arrival time
   of the peak flow and the shape of the hydrograph at different locations
   along the channel are not significantly affected by the sediment
   concentration and depend mostly on the steep channel morphology. Through
   this work we provide a framework for future studies aimed at improving
   hazard assessment, urban planning, and early warning systems in urban
   areas near mountain streams with limited data and affected by rapid
   flood events.}},

Abstract = {{This research proposes and evaluates a new approach for flash flood
   susceptibility mapping based on Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN))
   algorithm, with a case study at a high-frequency tropical storm area in
   the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam. Accordingly, a DLNN
   structure with 192 neurons in 3 hidden layers was proposed to construct
   an inference model that predicts different levels of susceptibility to
   flash flood. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the sigmoid were
   selected as the activate function and the transfer function,
   respectively, whereas the Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was used to
   update and optimize the weights of the DLNN. A database for the study
   area, which includes factors of elevation, slope, curvature, aspect,
   stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall, was
   established to train and validate the proposed model. Feature selection
   was carried out for these factors using the Information gain ratio. The
   results show that the DLNN attains a good prediction accuracy with
   Classification Accuracy Rate = 92.05\%, Positive Predictive Value =
   94.55\% and Negative Predictive Value = 89.55\%. Compared to benchmarks,
   Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Support Vector Machine, the
   DLNN performs better; therefore, it could be concluded that the proposed
   hybridization of GIS and deep learning can be a promising tool to assist
   the government authorities and involving parties in flash flood
   mitigation and land-use planning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Heavy rainfall is expected to intensify with increasing temperatures,
   which will likely affect rainfall spatial characteristics. The spatial
   variability of rainfall can affect streamflow and sediment transport
   volumes and peaks. Yet, the effect of climate change on the small-scale
   spatial structure of heavy rainfall and subsequent impacts on hydrology
   and geomorphology remain largely unexplored. In this study, the
   sensitivity of the hydro-morphological response to heavy rainfall at the
   small-scale resolution of minutes and hundreds of metres was
   investigated. A numerical experiment was conducted in which synthetic
   rainfall fields representing heavy rainfall events of two types,
   stratiform and convective, were simulated using a space-time rainfall
   generator model. The rain-fall fields were modified to follow different
   spatial rainfall scenarios associated with increasing temperatures and
   used as inputs into a landscape evolution model. The experiment was
   conducted over a complex topography, a medium-sized (477 km(2)) Alpine
   catchment in central Switzerland. It was found that the responses of the
   streamflow and sediment yields are highly sensitive to changes in total
   rainfall volume and to a lesser extent to changes in local peak rainfall
   intensities. The results highlight that the morphological components are
   more sensitive to changes in rainfall spatial structure in comparison to
   the hydrological components. The hydro-morphological features were found
   to respond more to convective rainfall than stratiform rainfall because
   of localized runoff and erosion production. It is further shown that
   assuming heavy rainfall to intensify with increasing temperatures
   without introducing changes in the rainfall spatial structure might lead
   to overestimation of future climate impacts on basin hydro-morphology.}},

Journal = {{URBAN WATER JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{The increasing flash floods phenomenon in arid and semi-arid regions of
   Algeria has led to a search for practical and feasible solutions. The
   use of mapping to delineate floodplain areas has become one of the
   solutions to mitigate this phenomenon. El Bayadh city has experienced a
   catastrophic flood on 1 October 2011 causing significant human and
   material damage. The present study aims to produce a flood hazard map of
   El Bayadh city based on rainfall amounts. Four precipitation values were
   proposed 40, 60, 80, and 100 mm, through which four flooded areas were
   obtained. This flood hazard map proves its effectiveness when used in
   conjunction with the weather warnings issued by the National Office of
   Meteorology. In this work, a hydrological study was done, and ArcGIS and
   HEC-RAS software were used.}},

Journal = {{URBAN WATER JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Within this work, the impact of mitigation measures and infiltration on
   flash floods is investigated by using a 2D robust shallow water model

   effectiveness of bypass channels in addition to retention basins.
   Retention basins at appropriate locations could reduce the maximum water
   depth at critical locations by 23\%, while the additional implementation
   of drainage channels lead to a reduction of 75\%, considering also
   infiltration lead to a further reduction of 97\%. If infiltration was
   considered without mitigation measures, the peak water depth was reduced
   by 67\%. For an exceptional extreme event the measures lead to a
   reduction of 73\% at some locations, while at other locations the
   overflow from retention basins due to overstraining generated even
   higher inundations with an increase of 58\%.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are unexpected events, which evolve rapidly and affect
   relatively small areas. The short time available for minimising risks
   requires preparedness and active response. In this context of risk
   management, the flood risk perception of the local population is the
   first step towards achieving resilience of people and communities.
   Although flood risk perception has intrinsic spatial variability, few
   previous studies take this into account. This paper explores the spatial
   variability of flash flood risk perception in the village of Navaluenga
   in Central Spain, using nonparametric and multivariate geostatistical
   tools. How local people perceived the flash flood risk to their homes
   was assessed interviewing a representative sample. Results show that
   considering these flash flood risk related spatial variables enhances
   people's psychological interpretation of risk perception: the perception
   of flash flood risk in a short time event is congruent with those
   spatial variables. These findings determine priority areas for future
   risk communication plans. They could also be extrapolated to other urban
   areas with a similar hydrographic configuration, when there is a flood
   hazard from a main river and potentially flooded minor water courses,
   which are even closer to houses but are not considered dangerous by the
   local population.}},

Abstract = {{Concentration of time (Tc) is a frequently used parameter in the
   evaluation of the hydrological response of different sizes hydrographic
   basin in case of rainfall events. The present study is innovative,
   because it has created an index that identifies the small-sized
   hydrographic basins that are exposed to the risk of flooding. The
   Moldavian Plain is an area located in the northeast of Romania where the
   local population is frequently affected by floods and flash floods
   caused by heavy rainfall events. The main purpose of the current study
   is to identify the settlements located in the small-sized hydrographic
   basins, which are associated with low concentration times and powerful
   surface runoff. The empirical method was applied in order to calculate
   the Tc for rainfall water, for each drainage basin, for a time class
   less than 6 hr. Calculations of the runoff water were also done for a
   theoretical extreme precipitation event, corresponding to the 1\%
   occurrence probability. A total number of 312 basins were identified
   that are smaller than 30 km(2), out of which 112 have Tc of less than 6
   hr. These basins, in particular, pose flood risk for 12.4\% of the

Abstract = {{In developing countries, the urbanisation process occurs with empirical
   urban management, a high increase of impermeable areas, and a lack of
   connection between water resource management and planning. In Brazil,
   concentrated rainfall and ineffective urban drainage systems add to this
   context and may impact the population with flash floods. Although
   sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) are widely used for flood
   mitigation, it is still not very well known how those strategies behave
   in semi-arid regions, where most of the time the weather is very dry. In
   Brazil, flood mitigation still mostly involves structural measures such
   as larger pipes or channels, with limited guidance for SuDS use due to
   the great resistance to change by citizens and managers. This study
   sought to analyse the efficacy of SuDS in Campina Grande, a semi-arid
   region of Brazil. A land-use and legislation-based methodology was
   developed with physical, climate, hydrological and governance data for
   three catchments and 312 sub-catchments in 30 applications and
   simulations. Simulations suggest that these strategies would be
   appropriate for semi-arid regions, with reductions in the flooded area,
   flooding volume, and impacts. This study is of relevance for cities with
   a similar climate to reach a sustainable level of urban drainage
   services, supporting the integration of urban planning and water
   resources management.}},

Abstract = {{The hilly regions of India have suffered many disasters, both natural
   and anthropogenic. In the hilly state like Uttarakhand, the hazards like
   flash flood, forest fires, and landslide affect the community at the
   large scale. These hazards cause severe physical injuries, loss of life,
   and at large scale property damage. To understand the impact of such
   natural hazards, we need to examine vulnerability of the society, so
   that we can define vulnerability as the status of a community to
   prevent, mitigate, prepare for or respond to a natural and a man-made
   hazard. The absence of coping strategies, which is also known as
   resilience, has altered the vulnerability of a community. Thus,
   vulnerability index of a community has to be calculated considering
   physical, social, economic and environmental factors associated with the
   community. This research paper tries to find out an integrated social
   vulnerability factor. The proposed integrated social vulnerability
   factor is determined by considering various factors, such as physical,
   social, economic, and environmental. All these factors increase the
   susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards. Poverty,
   occupation, child population, literacy rate, disability,
   marginalization, and inequities in wealth distribution of a society or
   community will also change the social vulnerability. Proposed Integrated
   social vulnerability index for the hilly terrain of Uttarakhand
   incorporated local technical knowledge insight and skills, so that local
   people and local administration are able to identify problems and can
   offer a solution to resist future emergencies i.e. the proposed social
   vulnerability indicator will support state, local, and traditional
   disaster management officials to determine areas of the most sensitive
   populations and better mitigation operation can be performed in case of
   disaster.}},

Abstract = {{Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a widely used method in solving
   classification and regression applications in industries, engineering,
   and science. This study investigates the optimizing capability of a
   swarm intelligence algorithm named moth flame optimizer (MFO) for the
   optimal search of a CNN hyper-parameters (values of filters) and weights
   of fully connected layers. The proposed model was run with a
   3-dimensional dataset (7 width height depth), which was constructed
   through including seven neighbor pixels (vertically and horizontally)
   from landslide location and 12 predictor variables. Muong Te district,
   Lai Chau province, Vietnam was selected as the case study, as it had
   recently undergone severe impacts of landslides and flash floods. The
   performance of this proposed model was compared with conventional
   classifiers, i.e., Random forest, Random subspace, and CNN-optimized
   Adaptive gradient descend, by using standard metrics. The results showed
   that the CNN-optimized MFO (Root mean square error \& x003D; 0.3685,
   Mean absolute error \& x003D; 0.2888, Area under Receiver characteristic
   curve \& x003D; 0.889 and Overall accuracy \& x003D; 80.1056 \& x0025;)
   outperformed the benchmarked methods in all comparing indicators.
   Besides, the statistical test of difference was also carried out by
   using the Wilcoxon signed ranked test for non-parametric variables. With
   these statistical measurements, the proposed model could be used as an
   alternative solution for landslide susceptibility mapping to support
   local disaster preparedness plans.}},

Abstract = {{Ultimate extreme flash floods can be acknowledged as a main reason of
   high casualties and infrastructure loss in many countries like Pakistan,
   Malaysia, Philippines, Southern France, India, Bangladesh, China, Nepal,
   Canada, United States of America and others. Run offs can devastate huge
   buildings and personal belongings within fraction of seconds. Flash
   floods usually occurs due to many reasons like higher precipitation
   velocity, melting of ice debris in ocean, high wave current at sea
   shore, broken reservoir (dam), Cloud to ground flashes, thunderstorm and
   hurricane inside the ocean. More than one hundred and twenty thousand
   casualties resulted due to the flash floods during the 1992 and 2005.
   According to the literature review deadliest flash floods have been
   observed in past history. Many approaches have been completed to
   investigate the flash floods accurately and precisely with less false
   alarm rate. Disaster management authorities are unable to forecast the
   natural disasters accurately and precisely like tsunami, flash floods,
   hurricanes and seismic events due to the poor efficiency of the sensors
   and transmission of missed information. It has also been observed that
   during the wireless data transmission of sensors to the controller unit
   some bits of the data are missed, due to these phenomena data is not
   transmitted properly or indicate the wrong observations. Several
   diversified approaches have been made to identify the run offs more
   accurately and precisely. Generally, the approaches can be classified
   into two categories a) Engineering Based b) Non-Engineering Based.
   Engineering techniques based on the construction of the dams and
   reservoirs to store the excess water which causes severe run offs.
   Designing of various Artificial Intelligence Based competent algorithms
   to predict the flash floods vigorously can be considered as
   non-engineering based approaches. Authors have tried their best to
   summarize and portray all the successful techniques that can be used for
   the early prediction of flash floods. Scientists can be benefited by
   this research paper as this research paper is the detailed capsulization
   of all the approaches that has been carried out for the robust
   investigation of flash floods. Extensive literature review has been done
   to observe the comparative analysis for the investigation of flash
   floods identification accurately. Literature review has been categorized
   into following types; 1. Sensory Fusion based 2. Artificial Intelligence
   Based methods 3. Radar and Satellite based approaches 4. Modeling and
   Nowcasting. According to the exhaustive literature review it can be
   concluded that swarm intelligence weights optimization for multi-layer
   perceptron neural network configuration performed better among all the
   forecasting approaches and recommended as the future enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Risk of flash floods is currently an important problem in many parts of
   Vietnam. In this study, we used four machine-learning methods, namely
   Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), Radial Basis Function Classifier
   (RBFC), Multinomial Naive Bayes (NBM), and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) to
   generate flash flood susceptibility maps at the minor part of Nghe An
   province of the Center region (Vietnam) where recurrent flood problems
   are being experienced. Performance of these four methods was evaluated
   to select the best method for flash flood susceptibility mapping. In the
   model studies, ten flash flood conditioning factors, namely soil, slope,
   curvature, river density, flow direction, distance from rivers,
   elevation, aspect, land use, and geology, were chosen based on
   topography and geo-environmental conditions of the site. For the
   validation of models, the area under Receiver Operating Characteristic
   (ROC), Area Under Curve (AUC), and various statistical indices were
   used. The results indicated that performance of all the models is good
   for generating flash flood susceptibility maps (AUC = 0.983-0.988).
   However, performance of LMT model is the best among the four methods
   (LMT: AUC = 0.988; KLR: AUC = 0.985; RBFC: AUC = 0.984; and NBM: AUC =
   0.983). The present study would be useful for the construction of
   accurate flash flood susceptibility maps with the objectives of
   identifying flood-susceptible areas/zones for proper flash flood risk
   management.}},

Abstract = {{In this overview (introductory article to a special issue including 14
   papers), we consider all main types of natural and artificial inland
   freshwater habitas (fwh). For each type, we identify the main
   biodiversity patterns and ecological features, human impacts on the
   system and environmental issues, and discuss ways to use this
   information to improve stewardship. Examples of selected key
   biodiversity/ecological features (habitat type): narrow endemics,
   sensitive (groundwater and GDEs); crenobionts, LIHRes (springs);
   unidirectional flow, nutrient spiraling (streams); naturally turbid,
   floodplains, large-bodied species (large rivers); depth-variation in
   benthic communities (lakes); endemism and diversity (ancient lakes);
   threatened, sensitive species (oxbow lakes, SWE); diverse, reduced
   littoral (reservoirs); cold-adapted species (Boreal and Arctic fwh);
   endemism, depauperate (Antarctic fwh); flood pulse, intermittent
   wetlands, biggest river basins (tropical fwh); variable hydrologic
   regime-periods of drying, flash floods (arid-climate fwh). Selected
   impacts: eutrophication and other pollution, hydrologic modifications,
   overexploitation, habitat destruction, invasive species, salinization.
   Climate change is a threat multiplier, and it is important to quantify
   resistance, resilience, and recovery to assess the strategic role of the
   different types of freshwater ecosystems and their value for
   biodiversity conservation. Effective conservation solutions are
   dependent on an understanding of connectivity between different
   freshwater ecosystems (including related terrestrial, coastal and marine
   systems).}},

Title = {{GIS-Based Geomorphological Map of the Calore River Floodplain Near
   Benevento (Southern Italy) Overflooded by the 15th October 2015 Event}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{On 15 October 2015, the floodplain of the Calore River underwent a
   destructive flood, with a stream stage increase up to 10 m. In this
   paper, we describe the GIS-based, object-oriented geomorphological map
   of the overflooded sectors of the Calore River floodplain near
   Benevento. The map graphically represents the field-checked results of a
   detailed geomorphological study carried out by means of GIS analysis of
   historical and topographic maps and orthophotos. Particular attention
   was devoted to the analysis of the channel adjustments experienced by
   the Calore River since the end of the 19th century, which shaped most of
   the landforms in the floodplain. The results showed that the
   investigated floodplain is characterized by abandoned channels,
   anthropogenic landforms, and five orders of recent river terraces
   separated by gently-sloping inactive fluvial scarps, less than 2 m high.
   On the oldest and/or more distal sectors of the floodplain, landforms
   are badly preserved, probably due to the more prolonged reshaping by
   natural erosional processes and anthropogenic activities, and to the
   high erodibility of the loose sediments in which they are shaped. The
   proposed map could be a key tool for a correct flood hazard assessment
   in the Benevento area, permitting thematic maps that avoid or reduce the
   negative effects of events similar to the 15 October 2015 flood.}},

Title = {{Flash Flood Forecasting Based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods occur frequently and distribute widely in mountainous areas
   because of complex geographic and geomorphic conditions and various
   climate types. Effective flash flood forecasting with useful lead times
   remains a challenge due to its high burstiness and short response time.
   Recently, machine learning has led to substantial changes across many
   areas of study. In hydrology, the advent of novel machine learning
   methods has started to encourage novel applications or substantially
   improve old ones. This study aims to establish a discharge forecasting
   model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for flash flood
   forecasting in mountainous catchments. The proposed LSTM flood
   forecasting (LSTM-FF) model is composed of T multivariate single-step
   LSTM networks and takes spatial and temporal dynamics information of
   observed and forecast rainfall and early discharge as inputs. The case
   study in Anhe revealed that the proposed models can effectively predict
   flash floods, especially the qualified rates (the ratio of the number of
   qualified events to the total number of flood events) of large flood
   events are above 94.7\% at 1-5 h lead time and range from 84.2\% to
   89.5\% at 6-10 h lead-time. For the large flood simulation, the small
   flood events can help the LSTM-FF model to explore a better
   rainfall-runoff relationship. The impact analysis of weights in the LSTM
   network structures shows that the discharge input plays a more obvious
   role in the 1-h LSTM network and the effect decreases with the
   lead-time. Meanwhile, in the adjacent lead-time, the LSTM networks
   explored a similar relationship between input and output. The study
   provides a new approach for flash flood forecasting and the highly
   accurate forecast contributes to prepare for and mitigate disasters.}},

Abstract = {{Floods not only induce vast economic damages but also pose a great
   danger to human life. In Slovenia, floods rank number one on the scale
   of damage magnitude. Different factors external to the hazard of
   flooding influence the gravity and extent of the impacts. A
   comprehensive collection and analysis of the information related to the
   understanding of causative factors of human impacts can substantially
   contribute to the mitigation and the minimisation of fatalities and
   injuries. In this work, historical analysis was performed for flood
   fatalities in the years between 1926 and 2014, with 10 flood events that
   induced 74 casualties considered. A detailed collection and review on
   human impacts was made. Victims in cars have seemed to increase in
   recent years and rural areas tend to be more vulnerable and susceptible
   to having victims of flooding. With regards to gender, the majority of
   victims are male. The focus was on demographic aspects (age and gender)
   of fatalities and analysis of the circumstances of loss of life. Based
   on a description of the activities of victims during flood events and
   repetitive patterns, groups were made based on the type of flood
   fatality. Eight interviews were performed with rescuers and people who
   were affected by floods in order to obtain more extensive information on
   preventative measures, received help, and flood risk perception.}},

Abstract = {{Floods represent frequent hazards in both low- and first-order
   catchments; however, to date, the investigation of peak flow discharges
   in the latter catchments has been omitted due to the absence of gauging
   stations. The quantification of flood parameters in a first-order
   catchment (1.8 km(2)) was realised in the moderate relief of NE Czechia,
   where the last flash flood event in 2014 caused considerable damage to
   the infrastructure. We used an integrated approach that included the
   dendrogeomorphic reconstruction of past flood activity, hydraulic
   modelling of the 2014 flash flood parameters using a two-dimensional
   IBER model, and evaluation of the channel stability using
   sedimentological parameters. Based on 115 flood scars, we identified 13
   flood events during the period of 1955 to 2018, with the strongest
   signals recorded in 2014, 2009 and 1977. The modelled peak flow
   discharge of the last 2014 flood was equal to 4.5 m(3)s(-1) (RMSE = 0.32
   m) using 26 scars as palaeostage indicators. The excess critical unit
   stream power was observed at only 24.2\% of the reaches, representing
   predominantly bedrock and fine sediments. Despite local damage during
   the last flood, our results suggest relatively stable geomorphic
   conditions and gradual development of stream channels under discharges
   similar to that in 2014.}},

Title = {{Flash Flood Early Warning Coupled with Hydrological Simulation and the

   Sichuan Province, China}},
Journal = {{WATER}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods in mountainous areas have become more severe and frequent
   as a result of climate change and are a threat to public safety and
   social development. This study explores the application of distributed
   hydrological models in flash floods risk management in a small watershed
   in Sichuan Province, China, and aims to increase early warning lead time
   in mountainous areas. The Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic
   Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model was used to simulate the flash flood
   process and analyze the variation in flood hydrographs. First, the
   HEC-HMS model was established based on geospatial data and the river
   network shape, and eight heavy rainfall events from 2010 to 2015 were
   used for model calibration and validation, showing that the HEC-HMS
   model was effective for the simulation of mountain floods in the study
   area. Second, with the assumption that rainfall and flood events have
   the same frequency, the flood hydrographs with different frequencies (p
   = 1\%, 2\%, 5\%, and 10\%) were calculated by the HEC-HMS model. The
   rising limbs of the flood hydrographs were significantly different and
   can be divided into three parts (0-5 h, 6-10 h, and 11-15 h). The rising
   rate of the flood stage for each part of the flood hydrograph increases
   in multiples. According to the analysis of the flood hydrographs, two
   critical early warning indicators with an invention patent were
   determined in the study: the flood stage for immediate evacuation and
   the rising rate. The application of the indicators in the study shows
   that it is feasible to advance the time of issuing an early warning
   signal, and it is expected that the indicators can offer a reference for
   flash flood early warning in the study area and other small watersheds
   in mountainous areas.}},

Title = {{A regional similarity-based approach for sub-daily rainfall
   nonparametric generation}},
Journal = {{RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Abstract = {{Rainfall time series with high temporal resolution are required for
   estimating storm events for the design of urban drainage systems, for
   performing rainfall-runoff simulation in small catchments and for
   modeling flash-floods. Nonetheless, large and continuous sub-daily
   rainfall samples are often unavailable. For dealing with the limited
   availability of high-resolution rainfall records, in both time and
   space, this paper explored an alternative version of the k-nearest
   neighbors algorithm, coupled with the method of fragments (KNN-MOF
   model), which utilizes a state-based logic for simulating consecutive
   wet days and a regionalized similarity-based approach for sampling
   fragments from hydrologically similar nearby stations. The proposed
   disaggregation method was applied to 40 rainfall gauging stations
   located in the Sao Francisco and Doce river catchments. Disaggregation
   of daily rainfall was performed for the durations of 60, 180 and 360
   minutes. Results indicated the model presented an appropriate
   performance to disaggregate daily rainfall, reasonably reproducing
   sub-daily summary statistics. In addition, the annual block-maxima
   behavior, even for low exceedance probabilities, was relatively well
   described, although not all expected variability in the quan tiles was
   properly summarized by the model. Overall, the proposed approach proved
   a sound and easy to implement alternative for simulating continuous
   sub-daily rainfall amounts from coarse-resolution records.}},

   analysis is the morphometric survey of a river basin, which allows
   establishing evaluation parameters on the behavior of the hydrological
   system of the river basin areas. Geographical information system (GIS)
   has emerged as an efficient tool in delineation of drainage pattern and
   ground water potential and its planning. A total of 122 river basins
   were identified and delineated, but only 3 (those of larger surface
   area) were selected for morphometric analysis and as a suitable case to
   evaluate the potential magnitude of flash floods in relation to their
   associated hazard level in the region. In addition, a peak discharge
   analysis was performed to predict approximately the behavior of the
   river basin in the presence of a series of theoretical rainstorms that
   may generate unusual runoff volumes that make up such flash floods. This
   study, when properly combined with geomorphology and geology analyses,
   helps to elaborate a primary hydrological diagnosis to predict the
   approximate behavior of the river basin at the time of heavy rainstorms.}},

   This work analyzes various morphometric characteristics of Rio Talacasto
   basin, situated approximately 80 km northwest of the city of San Juan,
   in the Central Precordillera geological province. Various morphometric
   parameters were analyzed in order to evaluate its flash flood hazard.
   For this purpose, some measurements (area, perimeter, length, width,
   maximum and minimum height and Strahler order, slope, aspect, curvature
   and convergence index, topographic position index, and roughness index)
   were calculated. These measurements allow a future analysis to predict
   approximately the behavior of the basin in the presence of a series of
   theoretical rainstorms that may generate unusual runoff volumes.
   The importance of this evaluation is that the studied basin includes the
   National Route 149 and the Provincial Route 436, both being the main
   accesses to the northern and western portions of the province. The
   results obtained conclude that the basin has a significant
   susceptibility to the occurrence of flash floods and other landslides.}},

Abstract = {{The present study evaluated submergence responses in 88 lowland
   indigenous rice (Oryza sativa L.) landraces from Koraput, India, to
   identify submergence-tolerant rice genotypes. In pot experiments,
   variations in survival rate, shoot elongation, relative growth index,
   dry matter, chlorophyll, soluble sugar and starch contents were
   evaluated in two consecutive years under well-drained and completely
   submerged conditions. Principal component analysis showed that the first
   three axes contributed 96.820\% of the total variation among the
   landraces, indicating wide variation between genotypes. Major traits
   such as survival rate, relative growth index, soluble sugar and starch
   contents appeared to be important determinants of phenotypic diversity
   among the landraces. Phenotypic coefficient of variance was higher than
   genotypic coefficient of variance for all the traits and all showed high
   heritability (90.38\%-99.54\%). Five rice landraces (Samudrabali,
   Basnamundi, Gadaba, Surudaka and Dokarakuji) were the most tolerant to
   submergence. When submerged for up to 14 d, Samudrabali, Basnamundi and
   Godoba were notable for having greater survival rates than a standard
   submergence tolerant variety FR13A, and also notable for elongating more
   vigorously and accumulating more biomass. These three landraces may
   therefore be especially useful in lowland rice growing areas that are
   affected by both moderate stagnant water and flash flooding. Molecular
   genotyping revealed that the submergence tolerance of Samudrabali,
   Basnamundi and Godoba is linked to the presence of one or more different
   Sub1 loci and it may well prove useful for breeding improved submergence
   tolerant rice varieties, thereby assising to improve yield stability in
   the rainfed lowland agro-ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Concerning the significant increase in the negative effects of
   flash-floods worldwide, the main goal of this research is to evaluate
   the power of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), fi (kNN), K-Star
   (KS) algorithms and their ensembles in flash-flood susceptibility
   mapping. To train the two stand-alone models and their ensembles, for
   the first stage, the areas affected in the past by torrential phenomena
   are identified using remote sensing techniques. Approximately 70\% of
   these areas are used as a training data set along with 10 flash-flood
   predictors. It should be remarked that the remote sensing techniques
   play a crucial role in obtaining eight out of 10 flash-flood
   conditioning factors. The predictive capability of predictors is
   evaluated through the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) method. As expected,
   the slope angle results in the factor with the highest predictive
   capability. The application of the AHP model implies the construction of
   ten pair-wise comparison matrices for calculating the normalized weights
   of each flash-flood predictor. The computed weights are used as input
   data in kNN-AHP and KS-AHP ensemble models for calculating the
   Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI). The FFPI also is determined through
   kNN and KS stand-alone models. The performance of the models is
   evaluated using statistical metrics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity and
   accuracy) while the validation of the results is done by constructing
   the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and Area Under Curve
   (AUC) values and by calculating the density of torrential pixels within
   FFPI classes. Overall, the best performance is obtained by the kNN-AHP
   ensemble model.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to monitor the flash flood response of Vidor/Wadore hill

   Management Model PCSWMM (hydrologic) and HEC-RAS 5.x (hydraulic) models.
   The method leverages remote sensing and GIS derive estimates of measured
   and inferred parameters of Vidor rural catchment to quantify the flash
   flood events of the last four years: 2014-2017. The calibration of the
   PCSWMM is performed using the sensitivity-based radio tuning calibration
   (SRTC) tool. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of
   determination (R-2), and relative error (RE) values were found between
   0.75-0.97, 0.94-0.98, and -0.22--0.09 respectively. The statistical
   indicators prove the accuracy of PCSWMM for rural catchments. The runoff
   response of Vidor torrent is also analyzed for 0.5/12.7, 1.5/38.1, and
   2.0/50.8-inch/mm rainfall hyetographs. The generated hydrographs are
   used to simulate 2D-module in HEC-RAS 5.x for floodplain demarcation in
   the piedmont area. The accuracy of the flood extent is analyzed using
   spatial overlay analogy in the ArcGIS environment by comparing simulated
   and historically available flood extents. The simulated flood extent
   shows 76\% accuracy with historic flood extent. The impact of flash
   flood events shows wheat, maize, and fruit orchards are the most
   effected agriculture in piedmont area. The results revealed that the
   integration of hydrological, hydraulic, and geospatial modeling
   approaches can be used to model a full picture of catchment response
   during flash flood events.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood is an uncertain and most catastrophic disaster worldwide
   that causes socio-economic problems, devastation and loss of
   infrastructure. One of the major triggering factors of flash floods is
   the extreme events like cloudburst that causes flooding of area within a
   short span of time. Therefore, this study aims to understand the
   variations in hydro-meteorological variables during the devastating
   Kedarnath cloudburst in the Uttarakhand, India. The hydro-meteorological
   variables were collected from the global satellites such as Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Tropical Rainfall Measuring
   Mission, modelled datasets from Decision Support System for
   Agrotechnology Transfer and National Center for Environmental Prediction
   (NCEP). For the validation of satellite meteorological data, the NCEP
   Global analysis data were downscaled using Weather Research and
   Forecasting model over the study area to achieve the meteorological
   variables' information. The meteorological factors such as atmospheric
   pressure, atmospheric temperature, rainfall, cloud water content, cloud
   fraction, cloud particle radius, cloud mixing ratio, total cloud cover,
   wind speed, wind direction and relative humidity were studied during the
   cloudburst, before as well as after the event. The outcomes of this
   study indicate that the variability in hydro-meteorological variables
   over the Kedarnath had played a significant role in triggering the
   cloudburst in the area. The results showed that during the cloudburst,
   the relative humidity was at the maximum level, the temperature was very
   low, the wind speed was slow and the total cloud cover was found at the
   maximum level. It is expected that because of this situation a high
   amount of clouds may get condensed at a very rapid rate and resulted in
   a cloudburst over the Kedarnath region.}},

Abstract = {{High rainfall events and flash flooding are becoming more frequent,
   leading to severe damage to crop production and water infrastructure in
   Burkina Faso, Western Africa. Special attention must therefore be given
   to the design of water control structures to ensure their flexibility
   and sustainability in discharging floods, while avoiding overdrainage
   during dry spells. This study assesses the hydroclimatic risks and
   implications of floodplain climate-smart rice production in southwestern
   Burkina Faso in order to make informed decisions regarding floodplain
   development. Statistical methods (Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope
   estimator, and frequency analysis) combined with rainfall--runoff
   modeling (HBV model) were used to analyze the hydroclimatic conditions
   of the study area. Moreover, the spatial and temporal water availability
   for crop growth was assessed for an innovative and participatory water
   management technique. From 1970 to 2013, an increasing delay in the
   onset of the rainy season (with a decreasing pre-humid season duration)
   occurred, causing difficulties in predicting the onset due to the high
   temporal variability of rainfall in the studied region. As a result, a
   warming trend was observed for the past 40 years, raising questions
   about its negative impact on very intensive rice cultivation packages.
   Farmers have both positive and negative consensual perceptions of
   climatic hazards. The analysis of the hydrological condition of the
   basin through the successfully calibrated and validated hydrological HBV
   model indicated no significant increase in water discharge. The sowing
   of rice from the 10th to 30th June has been identified as optimal in
   order to benefit from higher surface water flows, which can be used to
   irrigate and meet crop water requirements during the critical flowering
   and grain filling phases of rice growth. Furthermore, the installation
   of cofferdams to increase water levels would be potentially beneficial,
   subject to them not hindering channel drainage during peak flow.}},

Abstract = {{The Western Mediterranean, in common with other subtropical regions, has
   certain characteristics that make a purely surface-based synoptic
   classification inadequate. Sometimes, despite the surface synoptic
   situation not being conducive to precipitation, a depression aloft can
   trigger convection and produce strong rains and flash floods. To account
   for this, we develop a new synoptic classification centred on Catalonia
   (north-east of the Iberian Peninsula) which combines upper air and
   surface pressure situations. The existing Jenkinson-Collison
   classification of the surface pressure field is combined with a new
   simplified upper air classification based on 500 hPa geopotential
   height. Despite a reduced number of types at 500 hPa, the combination of
   both surface and 500 hPa gives many potential combinations. A reduction
   in the overall number was achieved by adjusting the combined
   classification to replicate the manual classification of Martin-Vide.
   The final classification is reduced to 13 synoptic patterns each of
   which provides a clear and well-defined daily synoptic situation. It is
   used to characterize days with/without cold air pool (CAP) events,
   derived from a network of 50 temperature sensors distributed across
   Cerdanya in Eastern Pyrenees. We show our new classification to be
   better at discriminating strong CAP days from no-CAP days than
   classifications based on surface pressure alone. Thus there is potential
   for the classification to be used by forecasters as a first step for
   predicting temperature inversions and weather in the Eastern Pyrenees.}},

   Growth, Extreme Climate, and Mismanagement}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Urban growth, extreme climate, and mismanagement are crucial controlling
   factors that affect flood vulnerability at wadi catchments. Therefore,
   this study attempts to understand the impacts of these three factors on
   the flash flood vulnerability in different climatic regions in Egypt. An
   integrated approach is presented to evaluate the urban growth from 1984
   to 2019 by using Google Images and SENTINEL-2 data, and to develop
   hazard maps by using a rainfall-runoff-inundation model (RRI). Annual
   rainfall trend analysis was performed to evaluate the temporal
   variability trend. The hazard maps that were created were classified
   into three categories (low, medium, and high) and integrated with the
   urban growth maps to evaluate the impacts on the flood-vulnerable areas.
   The results show a significant increase in urban growth resulting in an
   increase of prone areas for flood hazards over time. However, the degree
   of this hazard is mainly related to growth directions. Mismanagement
   affects urban growth directions in both planned and unplanned growth,
   whether by loss of control over unplanned growth or by deficiencies in
   approved plans. The rainfall analysis showed that there is no explicit
   relationship to increases or decreases in the flood vulnerable areas. An
   urban planning approach is recommended for risk reduction management
   based on a comprehensive study considering such factors.}},

Title = {{Is local flood hazard assessment in urban areas significantly influenced
   by the physical complexity of the hydrodynamic inundation model?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{580}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Flood hazard in urban areas is usually assessed by the estimations of
   parameters like flood extent, water depths, flow velocities and other
   related quantities. These hydrodynamic variables can be computed using
   flood inundation numerical models, the complexity of which has been
   analyzed in several papers in the literature. However, the question of
   how detailed a model should be in order to give reasonable results is
   still an open issue and no shared and general conclusions have been
   reached so far. One of the main reasons for this is that model
   benchmarking is very often carried out with reference to the flooded
   areas extent only, sometimes analyzing also the simulated water depths
   values and, quite rarely, evaluating the computed velocities. This is in
   contrast with the main purpose of the simulation models which are, from
   a practical point of view, advanced tools for flood hazard and
   vulnerability assessments. Finally, the lack of sufficient data on
   inundation extent and depths for the calibration and validation of the
   numerical models has been recognized, especially in complex situations
   that often characterize the flood evolution in a given area due to
   bridge obstructions, interaction with buildings and so on.
   In this paper, the performances of three different approaches to
   two-dimensional flood modeling (fully dynamic, diffusive and porosity
   approaches) have been evaluated with reference not only to the
   hydrodynamic variables, water depths and velocities, but also focusing
   the attention on their product and, thus, to the consequences associated
   to their different estimations on the vulnerability assessment. This
   analysis has been focused first on a flash flood flow experiment in a
   simplified urban district and then to the event which occurred in the
   city of Crotone (Calabria, Italy) in 1996.
   The results highlight that fully-dynamic modeling should be the
   unavoidable reference tool when the goal of the urban flood mapping
   activity is not limited to the evaluation of the flood-prone areas
   extent but involves also the local estimation of flood
   hazard/vulnerability.}},

Title = {{Utility of satellite-derived burn severity to study short- and long-term
   effects of wildfire on streamflow at the basin scale}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{580}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the changes in hydrologic response in a forested
   catchment impacted by wildfire in Colorado U.S.A. from the storm event
   to the inter-annual scales. We also evaluated the utility of a
   remotely-sensed burn severity index to study post-fire shifts in
   streamflow. At the storm-scale, we evaluated hydrologic shifts through
   changes in the effective runoff (Q{*}/P-Tot), peak streamflow (Q(pk))
   and response time (T-R/T-B) from multiple hydrographs, while at seasonal
   and inter-annual-scales we quantified hydrologic shifts through the
   runoff fraction (Q/P-Tot) and flow duration curves. Vegetation anomalies
   were monitored through comparisons of the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)
   between the burned and a hydrologically-similar, forested, neighboring,
   unburned catchment. We found short-term acute and long-term chronic
   transient streamflow shifts from the minute to the inter-annual scales.
   Flow duration curves indicate an order of magnitude increase in maximum
   flows. Event-average Q{*}/P-Tot rot increased by two orders of magnitude
   and Q(pk) increased by one order of magnitude relative to multiple
   representative pre-fire events of similar precipitation intensities.
   Decreases in T-R/T-B appear to be minimal. At the inter-annual scale,
   increases in the difference between simultaneous unburned and burned NBR
   are associated with increases in Q/P-Tot. A hydrologic recovery pathway
   is evident resembling a hysteresis effect driven by vegetation
   re-growth. Results illustrate the non-steady physical processes that
   increase flash-flooding risks post-fire in mountainous catchments and
   the utility of Delta NBR as a hydrologic predictor in ungauged
   watersheds.}},

   aims to predict water level and different weather conditions such as
   temperature, humidity soil moisture. The collected data can be used to
   report and to forecast alarms for possible and future disasters. In our
   proposal system, the collected flooding information will be send at real
   time to IBM Blue mix cloud platform. This cloud platform helps the
   regulatory and welfare authorities to take suitable action and allow
   proper flood alerts notifications in particularly for citizen. In this
   work, we address the problem of real time floods alerting, so we propose
   a novel design of floods prediction system based on Wsn and Internet of

   deduce about a true or a false alarms.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA)
   Warn-on-Forecast (WoF) program is to provide frequently updating,
   probabilistic model guidance that will enable National Weather Service
   (NWS) forecasters to produce more continuous communication of hazardous
   weather threats (e.g., heavy rainfall, flash floods, damaging wind,
   large hail, and tornadoes) between the watch and warning temporal and
   spatial scales. To evaluate the application of this WoF concept for
   probabilistic short-term flash flood prediction, the 0-3-h rainfall
   forecasts from NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory's (NSSL)
   experimental WoF System (WoFS) were integrated as the forcing to the NWS
   operational hydrologic modeling core within the Flooded Locations and
   Simulated Hydrographs (FLASH) system. Initial assessment of the
   potential impacts of probabilistic short-term flash flood forecasts from
   this coupled atmosphere-hydrology (WoFS-FLASH) modeling system were
   evaluated in the 2018 Hydrometeorology Testbed Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor
   Hydrology experiment held in Norman, Oklahoma. During the 3-week
   experiment period, a total of nine NWS forecasters analyzed three
   retrospective flash flood events in archive mode. This study will
   describe specifically what information participants extracted from the
   WoFS-FLASH products during these three archived events, and how this
   type of information is expected to impact operational decision-making
   processes. Overall feedback from the testbed participants' evaluations
   show promise for the coupled NSSL WoFS-FLASH system probabilistic flash
   flood model guidance to enable earlier assessment and detection of flash
   flood threats and to advance the current warning lead time for these

Title = {{A 68 ka precipitation record from the hyperarid core of the Atacama
   Desert in northern Chile}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{184}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Atacama Desert in northern Chile is one of the driest deserts on
   Earth. Hyperaridity persists at least since the Miocene and was
   punctuated by pluvial phases. However, very little is known about the
   timing, regional spread and intensities of precipitation changes. Here,
   we present a new precipitation record from a sedimentary sequence
   recovered in a tectonically blocked endorheic basin that is located in
   the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. The chronostratigraphic
   framework of the record is given by a multi-disciplinary dating
   approach, suggesting an age of ca. 68 ka BP for the core base. The
   sequence consists of three sediment types, whose sedimentological and
   geochemical characteristics suggest different depositional processes
   that reflect different degrees in humidity. First, particularly
   fine-grained sediments with high clastic but low calcium sulfate and
   carbonate contents reflect a particularly dry climate with only sporadic
   precipitation events and fluvial supply via channel systems. Second,
   more coarse-grained sediments with lower clastic and higher calcium
   sulfate and carbonate contents reflect more moist conditions with
   stronger precipitation events that lead to fluvial activity not
   restricted to the channels but involving the slopes and plains in the
   catchment. Third, normally graded layers with an equally high proportion
   of calcium sulfate and carbonate reflect occasional high-precipitation
   events that caused sediment supply also from most distant parts of the
   catchment via severe flash floods. The sedimentary succession suggests
   that precipitation changes took place on orbital but also on millennial
   time scales. Rather moist periods occurred during most of MIS 2, several
   shorter periods within MIS 3 and parts of MIS 4. Comparison of the
   findings from the Huara record with selected climate records from
   continental and marine sites in South America suggests a strong
   precipitation heterogeneity across the Atacama. This heterogeneity is
   caused by pronounced differences in the dominating climate patterns and
   a shift from predominant summer rain in the north to winter rain in the
   south. Precipitation supply to the Huara clay plan is controlled by the
   atmospheric circulation rather than the surface temperature of the
   adjacent ocean.}},

Abstract = {{This research examines the environmental and storm-scale characteristics
   of the extreme rainfall and flooding in the Houston, Texas, area on 18
   April 2016, known as the ``Tax Day{''} flood. Radar and local mesonet
   rain gauge observations were used to identify the locations and
   structures of extreme rain-rate-producing cells, with special attention
   given to rotating updrafts. To supplement this observation-based
   analysis, a WRF-ARW simulation of the Tax Day storm in 2016 was examined
   for the influence of any attendant rotation on both the dynamics and
   microphysics of the cells producing the most intense short-term (i.e.,
   subhourly to hourly) rainfall accumulations. Results show that the most
   intense rainfall accumulations in the model analysis, as in the
   observational analysis, are associated with rotating convective
   elements. A lowering of the updraft base, enhancement of the low-level
   vertical velocities, and increased low-level rainwater production is
   seen in rotating updrafts, compared to those without rotation. These
   differences are also maintained despite increased hydrometeor loading.
   The results agree with the findings of previous idealized model
   simulations that show dynamical accelerations associated with
   meso-gamma-scale rotation can enhance convective rainfall rates.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme hourly rainfall accumulations (e.g., exceeding 75 mm h(-1)) in
   several noteworthy flash flood events have suggested that the most
   intense accumulations were attendant with discrete mesoscale rotation or
   rotation embedded within larger organized systems. This research aims to
   explore how often extreme short-term rain rates in the United States are
   associated with storm-scale or mesoscale vortices. Five years of METAR
   observations and three years of Stage-IV analyses were obtained and
   filtered for hourly accumulations over 75 and 100 mm, respectively,
   clustered into events, and subjectively identified for rotation. The
   distribution of the short-term, locally extreme events shows the
   majority of the events were located along the Atlantic and Gulf of
   Mexico coastlines with additional events occurring in the central plains
   and into the Midwest. Nearly 50\% of the cases were associated with
   low-level rotation in high-precipitation supercells or mesoscale
   vortices embedded in organized storm modes. Rotation events occurred
   more clearly in the warm sector, while nonrotation events tended to
   occur along a surface boundary. The rotation events tended to produce
   higher hourly accumulations over a larger region, but were associated
   with somewhat stronger synoptic-to-mesoscale forcing for ascent and more
   total column moisture. These results support recent modeling results
   suggesting that rotationally induced dynamic vertical pressure
   perturbations should not be ignored when it comes to extreme
   precipitation and can potentially enhance the short-term rain rates.}},

Title = {{Torrential flood risk assessment and environmentally friendly solutions

Abstract = {{The management of torrential flood risk areas located in natural
   protected sites requires special approaches. Also, those processes can
   cause casualties and damage socioeconomic structures (roads, railways,
   houses, etc.) The processes intercept protected landscapes, sometimes
   endangering protected species and habitats. The restoration of the
   streambed's stability in protected areas and the protection of the
   economic objectives affected by the torrential floods, imply special
   measures of planning. The planning measures are based on the use of
   ecological materials and technologies with minimal impact on the
   environment.
   The article presents a methodology for identifying small river basins
   with high torrential risk and the endangered economic objectives, as
   well as applying this methodology into three Natura 2000 sites from
   central Romania (ROSCI0207 Postavaru, ROSCI0195 Piatra Mare and ROSCI
   0038 Ciucas).
   Identification of the basins was made considering their geomorphological
   and hydrological characteristics and the vulnerability of the
   intercepted socio-economic objectives. Into identified watershed,
   measurements of the streambed topography and the geometric
   characteristics of the endangered structures were made.
   Based on hydraulic simulations, maps were generated for floods with a
   100-year return period. Using these flood maps, the maximum water level
   was determined to highlight the flood risk areas for each socioeconomics
   structural objective.
   In areas identified as floodplain, special structural and nonstructural
   solutions are proposed for guiding water into convenient paths to avoid
   the endangered structures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Multiple environmental factors analysis of flash flood risk in Upper
   Hanjiang River, southern China}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Identifying the environmental factors and analyzing the causal mechanism
   of flash floods help to manage the risk. Maximum 24-h precipitation
   (MP), digital elevation (DE), slope degree (SD), soil type (ST),
   drainage density (DD), and vegetation cover (VC) are selected as the
   risk factors of flash floods in this study. Precipitation is the
   important meteorological components in flash floods; thus spatial
   characteristics of precipitation trend have been analyzed by using
   Mann-Kendall tests, and a positive trend of precipitation in Upper
   Hanjiang River is detected. Then, association rule mining approach is
   proposed to investigate the multiple environmental factors of flash
   floods, in which both single and multiple dimension data mining have
   been conducted by Apriori algorithm. Considering the high rate of 5-year
   return period floods in the flash flood inventory, further association
   rule mining after sampling has been conducted in order to deeply mine
   the causal patterns of flash floods in different risk magnitudes.
   Results show that soil type, slope degree, and digital elevation are the
   dominant environmental factors of flash floods in the study area, and
   precipitation is one of the important causal factors in severe flash
   flood hazards. It is also highlighted that flash floods might easily
   occur even with a slight rainfall present due to the instability of sand
   clay and saturated soil moisture. The proposed novel use of field data
   and data mining has the potential for providing procedures and solutions
   for an effective interpretation of flash flood mechanism. The results
   are expected to be applicable for decision-making and sustainable
   management in flooding risk.}},

Abstract = {{In recent past, rainfall-induced debris flow events in Ladakh-Nubra
   region have caused loss of lives and damages to civil infrastructures
   and army locations. Therefore, there is a need of high spatial and
   temporal monitoring of precipitation, and further to assess susceptible
   rainfall-induced debris flow zones in the area. We assessed the rainfall
   data collected at two gauge stations and observed a significant increase
   in the rainfall amount over the study region during summer-monsoonal
   period 1997-2017. Increasing trend was also observed from CRU gridded
   precipitation dataset. A GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation (MCE)
   method was performed by combining topographical, environmental and
   hydrological parameters for mapping of rainfall-induced susceptible
   zones. Suitability analysis of precipitation forecasts from WRF model at
   higher resolution (3 km) was also performed. A good agreement (r = 0.76)
   was observed between 4-day model forecast and field observed rainfall.
   Further, the simulated precipitation from WRF was incorporated into GIS
   model for assessment of debris flow susceptible zones for two cases of
   heavy precipitation events. The modelled high, medium, low and very low
   risk susceptible zones identified for the year 2015 events are validated
   with field survey and pre-post satellite imageries, and found in good
   agreement (ROC = 76.6\%). The model was able to identify affected areas
   during the Leh cloud burst event in year 2010. In addition, a threshold
   value of rainfall for initiation of debris flow in the region was also
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Several coastal regions on Earth have been increasingly affected by
   intense, often catastrophic, flash floods that deliver significant
   amounts of sediment along shorelines. One of the critical questions
   related to the impact of these impulsive runoffs is ``are flash floods
   more efficient in delivering non-cohesive sandy sediment along the
   coasts?{''} Here we relate flow stages (i.e., from erratic to
   persistent) to the grain size distribution of the suspended load, by
   performing a synergic analysis of in-situ river discharge and
   satellite-retrieved grain size distribution, from 2002 to 2014, covering
   the 2012 Tiber River (Italy) exceptional flood event. Our analysis shows
   novel and promising results regarding the capability of remote sensing
   in characterizing suspended sediment in terms of grain size distribution
   and reveals that erratic stages favour delivering of non-cohesive sandy
   sediment more than the persistent stages. This conclusion is supported
   by numerical simulations and is consistent with previous studies on
   suspended sediment rating curves.}},

Title = {{Optimal Location of Wells for Storage and Recovery of Surplus
   Desalinated Water in Coastal Aquifers}},
Journal = {{GROUNDWATER}},
Abstract = {{Storage of water in aquifers using injection wells is an efficient way
   for utilizing excess desalinated water in arid regions. In this
   investigation we estimate the benefits of optimally recharging seasonal
   surplus desalinated water into a strategic coastal aquifer already
   benefitting from natural recharge of flash-floods water by a recharge
   dam. Since, usually the buyers of desalinated water commit to purchase
   surplus desalinated water under take-or-pay contracts, any attempt in
   utilizing the paid water is beneficial. Coastal cities are observing an
   increased urbanization leaving limited space for aquifer recharge
   infrastructure. In order to determine the optimal location of wells and
   maximize the use of surplus desalinated water available in winter
   period, a decision tool combining a numerical groundwater flow
   simulation model (MODFLOW) with an optimization model is developed. The
   results of this study show that increasing the number of wells from the
   existing 45 wells to 173 would allow storing 31.4 million cubic meter
   per year of excess desalinated water into the aquifer that can be used
   during later during summer months. The net benefit would reach US\$55
   million/year while the cost of drilling the new wells is US\$5.11
   million.}},

Title = {{Farmers' decisions to adapt to flash floods and landslides in the
   Northern Mountainous Regions of Vietnam}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{252}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Understanding household's decision making in agricultural production to
   natural hazards is significant for policymakers and extension
   organizations in supporting farmers to optimize adaptive strategies,
   there are, however, still limited empirical researches that emphasize
   the determinants affecting the choice of measures in the process of
   adaptation. This paper explores the decision-making process of rural
   households in adapting to flash floods and landslides (FF\&LS) by
   conducting a household survey on 405 purposively selected households in
   Yen Bai province, one of the poorest mountainous regions in Vietnam.
   Based on the multi-portfolio framework, the study assumes that farmers
   have multiple choice of adaptation strategies simultaneously and these
   adaptation measures are correlative. Multivariate Probit models were
   used to figure out the household decision making process in adapting to
   FF\&LS. Survey results showed that changing cropping patterns, crop
   variegation, diversifying types of crop varieties, as well as managing
   and implementing crop protection (soil and plant) are the primary
   adaptation measures applied by local farmers. Furthermore, lack of
   money, inadequate support from local government, shortage of machinery
   and technical equipment, as well as insufficient knowledge about FF\&LS
   were listed as major constraints in the study area. The MVP analysis
   indicated that all farmers' perception, socio-economic, farming
   features, and institutional conditions strongly influence the farmers'
   adaptation decisions regarding FF\&LS. Future policies may therefore
   need to consider these major contributing factors with appropriate
   interventions to facilitate suitable adaptations for local farmers.}},

Abstract = {{The magnitudes of flash floods and their effect on channel width changes
   were investigated for Hara River in the Raya graben (northern Ethiopia).
   Precipitation was measured using rain gauges evenly distributed over the
   study catchment. Event peak discharges were measured with crest-stage
   gauges at a reference cross-section. Changes in channel width were
   measured at six monitoring sites along a 1.5 km long reach. Decadal
   channel width change was analyzed over the period 1965-2014. The average
   rainfall depth of the rainy days was 14.2 +/- 9.4 mm whereas the highest
   was 41.9 mm and the lowest, capable to generate some flow in the river,
   was only 1.8 mm. The maximum calculated discharge peaked at 408 m(3)/s
   whereas the lowest flow was 19.5 m(3)/s. An average widening of 0.11 +/-
   0.19 m per flood (for a total of 3.74 m) was measured. The cumulative
   precipitation and cumulative channel widening suggest that larger and
   longer lasting rains have substantial influence on channel width change.
   A marked increase in channel width commonly accompanies 2-3 days of
   flood duration; it is less marked where there is riparian vegetation on
   the banks. The long-term (1965, 1986, 2005, and 2010) measurements
   indicate that channel width increased rapidly over the last 50 years;
   nearly 25 m of widening. Generally, channel changes are mainly induced
   by the duration of floods rather than by their intensity and the data
   clearly show that ephemeral streams channel dynamics can be triggered
   also by floods much smaller than bankfull.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{In the recent time, Submergence1 (Sub1)QTL, responsible for imparting
   tolerance to flash flooding, has been introduced in many rice cultivars,
   but resilience of the QTL to stagnant flooding (SF) is not known. The
   response of Sub1-introgression has been tested on physiology, molecular
   biology and yield of two popular rice cultivars (Swarna and Savitri) by
   comparison of the parental and Sub1-introgression lines (SwarnaSub1 and
   SavitriSub1) under SF. Compared to control condition SF reduced grain
   yield and tiller number and increased plant height and
   Sub1-introgression mostly matched these effects. SF increased ethylene
   production by over-expression of ACC-synthase and ACC-oxidase enzyme
   genes of panicle before anthesis in the parental lines. Expression of
   the genes changed with Sub1-introgression, where some enzyme isoform
   genes over-expressed after anthesis under SF. Activities of endosperm
   starch synthesizing enzymes SUS and AGPase declined concomitantly with
   rise ethylene production in the Sub1-introgressed lines resulting in low
   starch synthesis and accumulation of soluble carbohydrates in the
   developing spikelets. In conclusion, Sub1-introgression into the
   cultivars increased susceptibility to SF. Subjected to SF, the QTL
   promoted genesis of ethylene in the panicle at anthesis to the detriment
   of grain yield, while compromising with morphological features like
   tiller production and stem elongation.}},

Abstract = {{The 14 September 2015 Hildale, Utah, storm resulted in 20 flash flood
   fatalities, making it the most deadly natural disaster in Utah history;
   it is the quintessential example of the ``paroxysmal precipitation of
   the desert{''}. The measured peak discharge from Maxwell Canyon at a
   drainage area of 5.3 km(2) was 266 m(3)/s, a value that exceeds envelope
   curve peaks for Utah. The 14 September 2015 flash flood reflects
   features common to other major flash flood events in the region, as well
   as unique features. The flood was produced by a hailstorm that was
   moving rapidly from southwest to northeast and intensified as it
   interacted with complex terrain. Polarimetric radar observations show
   that the storm exhibited striking temporal variability, with the Maxwell
   Canyon tributary of Short Creek and a small portion of the East Fork
   Virgin River basin experiencing extreme precipitation. Periods of
   extreme rainfall rates for the 14 September 2015 storm are characterized
   by K-DP signatures of extreme rainfall in polarimetric radar
   measurements. Similar K-DP signatures characterized multiple storms that
   have produced record and near-record flood peaks in Colorado Plateau
   watersheds. The climatology of monsoon thunderstorms that produce flash
   floods exhibits striking spatial heterogeneities in storm occurrence and
   motion. The hydroclimatology of flash flooding in arid/semiarid
   watersheds of the southwestern United States exhibits relatively weak
   dependence on drainage basin area. Large flood peaks over a broad range
   of basin scales can be produced by small thunderstorms like the 14
   September 2015 Hildale Storm, which pass close to the outlet.}},

Title = {{Unmasking difference: intersectionality and smallholder farmers'
   vulnerability to climate extremes in Northern Ghana}},
Journal = {{GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines intersectionality and climate vulnerability in
   Ghana's Upper West Region. Located within the southern fringe of the
   West African Sahel, and inhabited largely by smallholder farmers, the
   Upper West faces recurring climate extremes. This paper asks, how do the
   intersections between different inequalities and power relations shape
   vulnerability to climate extremes? Evidence for the paper comes from
   intensive qualitative fieldwork. Focusing especially on lived
   experiences from four case studies, the paper demonstrates the textured
   ways in which masculinity ideals, health status, religion, gender, age,
   marital status, and poverty intersect to deepen farmers' vulnerability
   to dry spells, flash floods, and after-storm recovery. Overall, the
   paper advances two interrelated arguments. Firstly, it argues that
   vulnerability analysis that focuses independently on gender, class,
   religion, and other characteristics, is insufficient because it risks
   homogenizing entire groups. Secondly, the paper argues that climate
   extremes do not always affect women more adversely than men. Indeed,
   dominant ideals of threatened masculinity can make men highly vulnerable
   during extreme climatic events. In the end, the paper concludes that if
   vulnerability analysis fails to unmask difference or move beyond binary
   gender categories, ensuing interventions may miss the real needs of
   countless individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to explore the spatial distribution pattern
   and influencing factors of the Chinese marathon. Geographic Information
   System (GIS) related spatial analysis tools were used to calculate the
   following-averaged nearest neighbor index, nuclear density analysis and
   hot spot analysis among others. The spatial distribution evolution
   characteristics and the influencing factors of eighteen Chinese marathon
   events in 2010, 129 in 2015 and 342 in 2018 were analyzed. The results
   show that (a) in 2010 the nearest neighbor ratio was 1.164714, Moran's I
   was -0.010165 (type: Random), in 2015 it was 0.502146, Moran's I was
   0.066267 (type: Clustered) and in 2018 it was 0.531149 and Moran's I was
   0.083485 (type: Clustered); (b) in 2010 there was a 333.6 km search
   radius; the core circle of the Yangtze River Delta was adopted. In 2015
   and 2018, a search radius of 556 km was adopted, which was respectively
   obtained from the core circle of the Yangtze River Delta, the core
   circle of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the core circle of East China; (c)
   according to the Z-value data, East China and North China in 2015 passed
   95\% confidence in five provinces and municipal hot spots, passed 90\%
   confidence in three hot spots and passed 95\% confidence in Chongqing
   Cold Point. In 2018, East China, North China, Central Region and eight
   other provinces and cities' hot spots passed 95\% confidence, four hot
   spots passed 90\% confidence, the Tibet Autonomous Region cold spot
   passed 90\% confidence. Conclusion: The overall distribution of marathon
   events is greater in the eastern region than the western region, greater
   in the southern region than the northern region and greater in coastal
   regions than the inland regions; the nuclear density distribution has
   spread from the Yangtze River Delta mononuclear circle in 2010 to the
   core circle of the entire East China region. Moreover, it spread to
   North China, Central China and South China; the distribution of hot
   spots spread from Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang to the entire North
   China and East China regions. During the past thirty-eight years of
   development of the Chinese marathon, it has been divided into three
   stages due to different political, economic and social environments.}},

Abstract = {{Bulgaria is a country with a high frequency of hail and thunderstorms
   from May to September. For the May-September 2010-2015 period,
   statistical regression analysis was applied to identify
   predictors/classification functions that contribute skills to
   thunderstorm forecasting in the Sofia plain. The functions are based on
   (1) instability indices computed from radiosonde data from Sofia station
   F1, and (2) combination of instability indices and Integrated Water
   Vapor (IWV), derived from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   station Sofia-Plana, F2. Analysis of the probability of detection and
   the false alarm ratio scores showed the superiority of the F2
   classification function, with the best performance in May, followed by
   June and September. F1 and F2 scores were computed for independent data
   samples in the period 2017-2018 and confirmed the findings for the
   2010-2015 period. Analysis of IWV and lightning flash rates for a
   multicell and supercell thunderstorm in June and July 2014 showed that
   the monthly IWV thresholds are reached 14.5 and 3.5 hours before the
   thunderstorm, respectively. The supercell IWV peak registered 40 min
   before the thunderstorm, followed by a local IWV minimum corresponding
   to a peak in the flash rate. In both cases, an increase of IWV during
   severe hail was registered, which is likely related to the hydrometeor
   contribution to GNSS path delay. The results of this study will be
   integrated into the Bulgarian Integrated NowCAsting tool for
   thunderstorm forecasting in the warm/convective season.}},

Abstract = {{Pebbles up to 10 cm in diameter, as the main clastic component of gas
   reservoirs in the Permian Sulige Gas Field, deposited more than 150 km
   away from their northward provenance (Yinshan Mountains) in the northern
   Ordos Basin. The transportation and depositional mechanisms of these
   pebbles have been unclear for decades. Based on core examinations,
   facies analysis, and mathematical modeling (stress field calculation of
   pebbles), it is thought that (1) these coarse-grained deposits were
   transported and deposited in braided rivers; (2) the size of
   coarse-grained sediments and pebbles in the Sulige Gas Field is in
   accordance with the size of flash flood; (3) flash flood is regarded as
   a crucial important transporting mechanism of pebbles; and (4) the
   ``flash flood genesis{''} braided river-braided delta sedimentary model
   provides a reasonable understanding for prediction of coarse-grained
   reservoirs for gas exploration not only in the Permian Sulige Gas Field

Abstract = {{Flood modelling is an important first step towards understanding and
   managing floods, at all spatial scales, from a large catchment of a
   river to highly developed urban areas and to individual property and
   infrastructure. Recent advances in modelling techniques along with
   sophisticated computational tools and data products have facilitated a
   rapid progress in flood modelling. Despite this progress, an accurate
   assessment and forecasting of floods with the associated risk is still
   elusive due to uncertainties at each stage of the modelling. This paper
   presents a review of flood modelling with specific focus on India. In
   recent years, significant contributions have been made by Indian
   researchers to the hydrologic science in general, and to flood modelling
   in particular. Indian contributions to the areas of hydrologic modelling
   of floods, flood forecasting, flash flood modelling, urban floods, and
   risk assessment and mitigation are reviewed in the paper. Since the
   emphasis is on flood modelling, the related topics of flood frequency
   analysis are excluded, although some representative studies on extreme
   rainfall frequencies are briefly mentioned. The paper concludes with
   some perspectives on future directions in flood modelling and actions
   needed for sustainable flood management practices, in the country.}},

Title = {{River Discharge Simulation in the High Andes of Southern Ecuador Using

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of river discharge using hydrological models (HMs) is of
   utmost importance, especially in basins that provide drinking water or
   serve as recreation areas, to mitigate damage to civil structures and to
   prevent the loss of human lives. Therefore, different HMs must be tested
   to determine their accuracy and usefulness as early warning tools,
   especially for extreme precipitation events. This study simulated the
   river discharge in an Andean watershed, for which the distributed HM
   Runoff Prediction Model (RPM) and the semi-distributed HM Hydrologic
   Modelling System (HEC-HMS) were applied. As precipitation input data for
   the RPM model, high-resolution radar observations were used, whereas the
   HEC-HMS model used the available meteorological station data. The
   obtained simulations were compared to measured discharges at the outlet
   of the watershed. The results highlighted the advantages of distributed
   HM (RPM) in combination with high-resolution radar images, which
   estimated accurately the discharges in magnitude and time. The
   statistical analysis showed good to very good accordance between
   observed and simulated discharge for the RPM model (R-2: 0.85-0.92; NSE:
   0.77-0.82), whereas for the HEC-HMS model accuracies were lower (R-2:
   0.68-0.86; NSE: 0.26-0.78). This was not only due to the application of
   means values for the watershed (HEC-HMS), but also to limited rain gauge
   information. Generally, station network density in tropical mountain
   regions is poor, for which reason the high spatiotemporal precipitation
   variability cannot be detected. For hydrological simulation and
   forecasting flash floods, as well as for environmental investigations
   and water resource management, meteorological radars are the better
   choice. The greater availability of cost-effective systems at the
   present time also reduces implementation and maintenance costs of dense
   meteorological station networks.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation is a critical variable for comprehending various
   climate-related research, such as water resources management, flash
   flood monitoring and forecasting, climatic analyses, and hydrogeological
   studies, etc. Here, our objective was to evaluate the rainfall estimates
   obtained from Global Precipitation Mission (GPM), and Global Satellite
   Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) constellation over an arid environment
   like the Sultanate of Oman that is characterized by a complex topography
   and extremely variable rainfall patterns. Global Satellite-based
   Precipitation Estimates (GSPEs) can provide wide coverage and high
   spatial and temporal resolutions, but evaluating their accuracy is a
   mandatory step before involving them in different hydrological
   applications. In this paper, the reliability of the Integrated
   Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the GPM (IMERG) V04 and GSMaP V06
   products were evaluated using the reference in-situ rain gauges at
   sub-daily (e.g., 6, 12, and 18 h) and daily time scales during the
   period of March 2014-December 2016. A set of continuous difference
   statistical indices (e.g., mean absolute difference, root mean square
   error, mean difference, and unconditional bias), and categorical metrics
   (e.g., probability of detection, critical success index, false alarm
   ratio, and frequency bias index) were used to evaluate recorded
   precipitation occurrences. The results showed that the five GSPEs could
   generally delineate the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall while
   they might have over- and under-estimations of in-situ gauge
   measurements. The overall quality of the GSMaP runs was superior to the
   IMERG products; however, it also encountered an exaggeration in case of
   light rain and an underestimation for heavy rain. The effects of the
   gauge calibration algorithm (GCA) used in the final IMERG (IMERG-F) were
   investigated by comparison with early and late runs. The IMERG-F V04
   product did not show a significant improvement over the early (i.e.,
   after 4 h of rainfall observations) and late (i.e., after 12 h of
   rainfall observations) products. The results indicated that GCA could
   not reduce the missed precipitation records considerably.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, Malaysia has become one of the world's most urbanized
   nations, causing severe flash flooding. Urbanization should meet the
   population's needs by increasing the development of paved areas, which
   has significantly changed the catchment's hydrological and hydraulic
   characteristics. Therefore, the frequency of flash flooding in
   Malaysia's urban areas has grown year after year. Numerous techniques
   have been used, including the statistical approach, modeling, and storm
   design methods, in flood simulation. This research integrated hydrology
   and hydraulic models to simulate the urban flood events in the Aur River
   catchment. The primary objective is to determine water level and
   forecast peak flow based on hydrological assessment in the drainage
   system using XPSWMM software. The rainfall data for 60 min was used for
   this study in the hydrological analysis by obtaining an
   intensity-duration-frequency curve and peak flow value (Q peak). XPSWMM
   is used to simulate the response of a catchment to rainfall events in
   which runoff, water depth profile, and outflow hydrograph are obtained.
   Peak runoff is also obtained from the modified rational method for
   validation purposes. The proposed method was verified by comparing the
   result with the standard method. This is essential to identify flash
   flooding, which can lead to efficient flood mitigation planning and
   management in the urban catchment. The increase in residential areas
   results in the alteration of time of concentration, water quantity, and
   flow rate. Thus, to mitigate present and future problems, the effects of
   urbanization on water resources and flood should be analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{This study shows the feasibility of the combined use of multi-satellite
   data and an energy-water balance model for improving the estimates of
   water fluxes over time and distributed in space in the Yangtze River
   basin. In particular, a new methodology is used to constrain an internal
   model variable of the distributed hydrological model based on the
   satellite land surface temperature. The hydrological FEST-EWB model
   (flash flood event-based spatially distributed rainfall-runoff
   transformation-energy water balance model) with its energy-water balance
   scheme allows to continuously compute in time and distributed in space
   soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes thanks to a double link
   with satellite-derived data as input parameters (e.g., LAI) and as
   variables for model states' updates as the land surface temperature
   (LST). This LST was used to calibrate the model soil parameters instead
   of using only dedicated ground measurements. The effects of the
   calibration procedure were evaluated at four available river
   cross-sections along the Yangtze River, considering also the presence of
   the Three Gorges Dam. Flow duration curves were also considered to
   understand the volume storages' changes. The Poyang and Dongting Lakes
   dynamics were simulated from FEST-EWB and compared against satellite
   water extended from MERIS and ASAR data and water levels from LEGOS
   altimetry data (Topex/Poseidon). The FEST-EWB model was run at 0.009
   degrees spatial resolution and three hours of temporal resolutions for
   the period between 2003 and 2006. Absolute errors on LST estimates of 3
   degrees C were obtained while discharge data were simulated with errors
   of 10\%. Errors on the water area extent of 7\% and on the water level
   of 3\% were obtained for the two lakes.}},

   Warnings}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Owing to their short duration and high intensity, flash floods are among
   the most devastating natural disasters in metropolises. The existing
   warning tools-flood potential maps and two-dimensional numerical
   models-are disadvantaged by time-consuming computation and complex model
   calibration. This study develops a data-driven, probabilistic
   rainfall-inundation model for flash-flood warnings. Applying a modified
   support vector machine (SVM) to limited flood information, the model
   provides probabilistic outputs, which are superior to the Boolean
   functions of the traditional rainfall-flood threshold method. The
   probabilistic SVM-based model is based on a data preprocessing framework
   that identifies the expected durations of hazardous rainfalls via
   rainfall pattern analysis, ensuring satisfactory training data, and
   optimal rainfall thresholds for validating the input/output data. The
   proposed model was implemented in 12 flash-flooded districts of the
   Xindian River. It was found that (1) hydrological rainfall pattern
   analysis improves the hazardous event identification (used for
   configuring the input layer of the SVM); (2) brief hazardous events are
   more critical than longer-lasting events; and (3) the SVM model exports
   the probability of flash flooding 1 to 3 h in advance.}},

Abstract = {{The inner continental shelf is regarded as a repository of hyperpycnal
   flow (HF) deposits the analysis of which may contribute to
   hydrogeological risk assessment in coastal areas. In line with the
   source to sink paradigm, we examined the dynamics of the coastal
   watersheds facing the Salerno Gulf (Southern Tyrrhenian Sea) in
   generating hyperpycnal flows and investigated the shallow marine
   sediment record to verify their possible occurrence in the recent past.
   Thus, the morphometric properties (hypsometric integral, hypsometric
   skewness, hypsometric kurtosis, density skewness and density kurtosis)
   of the watersheds together with the potential rivers' discharge and
   sediment concentration, calculated by applying altitude- and extent
   -based experimental relations, allowed to detect the rivers that were
   prone to producing HFs. In the shallow marine environment record of the
   last 2 kyr, anomalous sedimentation, possibly linked to HF events, was
   identified by comparing the sand-mud ratio (S/M) down-core -at three
   sites off the main river mouths - to the expected S/M calculated by
   applying the relation governing the present-day distribution of sand at
   the seabed in the Salerno Gulf. A return period of major HF events <=
   0.1 kyr can be inferred for rivers which fall into the category ``dirty
   rivers{''}. In these cases, the watersheds have a hypsometric index
   ranging between 0.2 and 0.3, coastal plains not exceeding 30\% of the
   entire catchment area and a maximum topographic height >= 1000 m. A
   return period of about 0.3 kyr has been inferred for the ``moderately
   dirty rivers{''}. In these other cases, about 50\% of the watersheds
   develop into a low gradient coastal plain and have a hypsometric index
   ranging between 0.09 and 0.2. The observations on land and offshore have
   been complemented to reach a more comprehensive vision of the coastal
   area dynamics. The method here proposed corroborates the effectiveness
   of the source to sink approach and is applicable to analogous sediment
   records in temperate continental shelves which encompass the last 3 kyr,
   a time interval in which the oscillations of relative sea level can be
   overlooked.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many urban areas face an increasing flood risk, which includes the risk
   of flash floods. Increasing extreme precipitation events will likely
   lead to greater human and economic losses unless reliable and efficient
   early warning systems (EWS) along with other adaptation actions are put
   in place in urban areas. The challenge is in the integration and
   analysis in time and space of the environmental, meteorological, and
   territorial data from multiple sources needed to build up EWS able to
   provide efficient contribution to increase the resilience of vulnerable
   and exposed urban communities to flooding. Efficient EWS contribute to
   the preparedness phase of the disaster cycle but could also be relevant
   in the planning of the emergency phase. The RainBO Life project
   addressed this matter, focusing on the improvement of knowledge,
   methods, and tools for the monitoring and forecast of extreme
   precipitation events and the assessment of the associated flood risk for
   small and medium watercourses in urban areas. To put this into practice,
   RainBO developed a webGIS platform, which contributes to the
   ``planning{''} of the management of river flood events through the use
   of detailed data and flood risk/vulnerability maps, and the ``event
   management{''} with real-time monitoring/forecast of the events through
   the collection of observed data from real sensors, estimated/forecasted
   data from hydrologic models as well as qualitative data collected

Abstract = {{Objective: Heavy rain and flash flooding left behind a trail of disaster
   in the western and south-western provinces of Iran in April 2016. The
   purpose of this study is to highlight the response functions that should
   be undertaken when such disasters strike. Methods: Secondary data, such
   as documents, organizational reports, and forms completed during
   response to the flood visits, were the methods of data collection in
   this study. Then, collected data were analyzed according to the response
   functions to disasters. Results: The study found that a strong disaster
   response function was the early warning system, by the Iran
   Meteorological Organization, announced 1 week before the flood. Weaker
   functions were the lack of coordination among response organizations and
   the lack of a safety officer in the Incident Command System structure
   during the flash flood. Conclusions: The list of the disaster response
   functions identified by this study should aid the decision makers and
   first responders in facing natural or man-made disasters and enable them
   to better prepare for response functions in the future disasters.}},

Abstract = {{The use of PIT tags has rapidly proliferated since their introduction,
   and new mobile detection methods have been developed. However, the
   presence of ghost tags (i.e., PIT tags left in the system after a fish
   dies) creates uncertainty about the status (live or dead) of tags
   detected. Herein, we describe our raft-based mobile PIT tag antenna
   system, which was used to evaluate the movements of ``seeded tags{''}
   (i.e., PIT tags that we placed in the river as ghost tag analogs) and
   their interactions with habitat features. We deployed 5,000 seeded tags
   in the San Juan River, a large sand-bed river in the southwestern USA.
   Total distances moved by PIT tags ranged from 0.8 to 4,124 m, but 75\%
   of movements were less than 100 m. Flow conditions causing the smallest
   to largest movements were (1) base flows, (2) spring runoff flows, (3)
   flash flood flows, and (4) a combination of spring runoff and flash
   flood flows. Based on Ivlev's electivity index, tags were more likely to
   be detected in riffles than in runs. These findings will help to
   classify mobile PIT tag detections as ghost tags or live fish, a
   critical data gap limiting the accurate estimation of demographic rates,
   population status metrics, and descriptions of the habitat use of
   fishes.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{41}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Floods are among the most frequent phenomena leading to disastrous, long
   term social and economic impacts globally. On November 15, 2017, 24
   people were killed and hundreds were left homeless in the vicinities of
   the towns of Mandra and Nea Peramos in Attica region, Greece, as a
   result of a catastrophic flash flood triggered by extreme rainfall. The
   impact of such events has been the focus of studies for years
   consistently indicating adverse effects ranging from short to long term,
   on post-disaster physical and psychological health. This paper explores
   the initial impact of extreme flash floods on communities in terms of
   psychological and physical health, by means of a self-report
   questionnaire. Findings are investigated in relation to demographic
   variables and vulnerability predictors. Self-reports differed prior and
   after the flash flood, with negative changes in both domains. Results
   indicated significant differences in both physical and physiological
   health by gender, age, marital and occupational status. According to
   Spearman's correlation coefficient, physical and psychological effects
   showed moderately positive correlations for most independent variables.
   Results indicate a need to align prevention, aid and intervention
   strategies in the recovery phase and address issues such as public
   awareness, information provision and post disaster coping strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The trend of flood damages triggered by heavy downpour continues in the
   southeastern region of Bangladesh due to a lack of non-structural
   approaches, effective planning and policy. Appropriate guidelines will
   be needed to develop a robust strategy for improving flood risk
   management based on advanced technologies, research and practices. The
   experience gained through the recent EU-funded projects for flash
   floods, the EU Water Framework Directive and Floods Directive, and the
   Driver Pressure State Impact Response (DPSIR) framework provide useful
   insights to solve the problems associated with the flash floods in
   Bangladesh. Flood marks, post-flood analysis and witness interviews in
   FLOODsite basins of Europe provide good practices for improving the
   flash flood risk management. This paper presents normative conclusions
   from case studies conducted in Feni, Bangladesh on how to manage pluvial
   flood risk resiliently using strategic planning by considering
   EU-policy, practice and framework. Interviews were conducted,
   questionnaires, field observations and focus group discussions were
   undertaken with the affected community with and without flood
   experience, national water experts, water management practitioners and
   local authorities responsible for decision-making on flood risk
   management. The paper concludes with a number of recommendations for
   pluvial flood risk management policy making, strategy formulating and

Title = {{Physically-based landfalling tropical cyclone scenarios in support of
   risk assessment}},
Journal = {{WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{26}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Populations and property values are increasing in tropical cyclone prone
   regions, driving up repair and replacement costs following a tropical
   cyclone impact. Climate change influences on tropical cyclones and sea
   levels will only exacerbate these rises. For example, Australia's Severe
   Tropical Cyclone Debbie in 2017 was one of the most destructive cyclones
   to make landfall in Australia since Tropical Cyclone Tracy in 1974. The
   primary impacts of Cyclone Debbie were due to extreme short duration
   intense wind driven rainfall and widespread major flooding, both linked
   to uncharacteristically warm sea surface temperatures. Studying the
   impact of climate change on tropical cyclones is limited by the lack of
   well observed historical events. Traditional hazard risk assessment
   approaches are limited since they are primarily based on statistical
   models which only deal with single meteorological hazards, or use
   simplified parameterized relationships when more than one phenomenon is
   included. Here we explore the value of dynamical models for creating
   targeted, detailed, and physically plausible multi-hazard tropical
   cyclone scenarios, through the development of a modeling system that i)
   retains a high degree of simulation control, ii) is globally applicable,
   and iii) is responsive to climate variability and change. Application of
   the modeling system to a thermodynamic climate change scenario finds
   that the tropical cyclone penetrates much further inland with a marked
   expansion of the heavy rainfall area, resulting in significantly larger
   areas subjected to damaging and destructive wind speeds and rainfall
   totals capable of producing flash and riverine flooding.}},

Abstract = {{The Flash Flood and Intense Rainfall (FFaIR) Experiment developed within
   the Hydrometeorology Testbed (HMT) of the Weather Prediction Center
   (WPC) is a pseudo-operational platform for participants from across the
   weather enterprise to test emerging flash flood forecasting tools and
   issue experimental forecast products. This study presents the objective
   verification portion of the 2017 edition of the experiment, which
   examines the performance from a variety of guidance tools (deterministic
   models, ensembles, and machine-learning techniques) and the
   participants' forecasts, with occasional reference to the participants'
   subjective ratings. The skill of the model guidance used in the FFaIR
   Experiment is evaluated using performance diagrams verified against the
   Stage IV analysis. The operational and FFaIR Experiment versions of the
   excessive rainfall outlook (ERO) are evaluated by assessing the
   frequency of issuances, probabilistic calibration, Brier skill score
   (BSS), and area under relative operating characteristic (AuROC). An ERO
   first-guess field called the Colorado State University Machine-Learning
   Probabilities method (CSU-MLP) is also evaluated in the FFaIR
   Experiment. Among convection-allowing models, the Met Office Unified
   Model generally performed optimally throughout the FFaIR Experiment when
   using performance diagrams (at the 0.5- and 1-in. thresholds; 1 in. =
   25.4 mm), whereas the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), version 3,
   performed best subjectively. In terms of subjective and objective
   ensemble scores, the HRRR ensemble scored optimally. The CSU-MLP
   overpredicted lower risk categories and underpredicted higher risk
   categories, but it shows future promise as an ERO first-guess field. The
   EROs issued by the FFaIR Experiment forecasters had improved BSS and
   AuROC relative to the operational ERO, suggesting that the experimental
   guidance may have aided forecasters.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The assessment of hydrological model parameters is impacted by
   uncertainties that may be attributed to several sources of errors. Many
   methods have been developed and applied to various hydrological models
   in order to address these uncertainties. The present study aims to apply
   two uncertainty analysis methods, i.e., generalized uncertainty
   estimation (GLUE) and differential evolution adaptive metropolis
   (DREAMzs), for the purpose of evaluating the parametric and predictive
   uncertainty of the HEC-HMS hydrological model. The HEC-HMS model was
   coupled to these two approaches in order to simulate flash floods in the
   Mekerra watershed (Algeria) and to estimate the uncertainty of 14 model
   parameters which are due to be calibrated. For this, six flood events
   were selected for the purpose of calibrating and validating the model,
   two informal likelihood measures L1 and L2 were applied in GLUE and one
   formal likelihood measure was applied in DREAMzs. Considering the
   difference between the results, and not the principles of the two
   methods, the analysis indicated that these parameters can be better
   identified by DREAMzs algorithm. Indeed, the coefficients of variation
   of their posterior distributions are generally lower. Compared to GLUE,
   DREAMzs algorithm is more efficient in exploring the parametric space.
   With regard to the predictive uncertainty, 95\% of the uncertainty
   intervals were estimated by both methods and then analyzed. The DREAMzs
   algorithm results suggested a good dynamics of the simulated floods,
   associated with a significant uncertainty that is due not to the
   parametric uncertainty but to other sources of errors. The GLUE
   algorithm generates similar results but does not distinguish between the
   total uncertainty and parametric uncertainty. Further studies would be
   desirable to evaluate the impact of other likelihood measures on the
   simulation results with both algorithms}},

Abstract = {{The failure of a 24{''}natural gas pipeline buried in the 1960s led to a
   blowout followed by fire. The damage caused the breakage and expulsion
   of 20 meters of tube; flames reached 30 meters high. The break occurred
   at the edge of a high transit route, in the opposite site of a
   thermoelectric plant, and under its high-voltage lines. The break was a
   consequence of a fracture propagated from a pre-existing defect in the
   reinforcement weld toe of a 3{''} connection to a nearby village, made
   20 years before. The preexisting defect propagated from small weld
   anomalies, due to external loads related to soil instabilities: removal
   of top soil for pipe recoating and flooding due to extraordinary rains
   paired with the recent construction of a highway that distorted normal
   water flows. Lessons were also learned in terms of the role of witness
   recounts. Even after root causes were technically established,
   responsibility was erroneously attributed to high voltage cables (in the
   ignition of the gas cloud) and dynamic loads from traffic (as cause for
   leak), due in large part to the credibility given to initial
   descriptions. Witnesses identified three events: (1) a noise associated
   with the blow-out, (2) noise and flashes associated with electrical
   arcing and (3) the final explosion of the gas cloud, although they did
   not agree on the sequence of the first two events. The immediacy of the
   three events and the witnesses' different places and distances from the
   blowout site justify the differences of time between their perceptions
   of light and sound.}},

   forested catchment in northern Iran}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The provinces of northern Iran that border the Caspian Sea are forested
   and may be prone to increased risks of flooding due to deforestation and
   other land use changes, in addition to climate change effects. This
   research investigated changes in runoff from a small forested catchment
   in northern Iran for several land use change scenarios and the effects
   of higher rainfall and high antecedent soil moisture. Peak discharges
   and total runoff volumes from the catchment were estimated using the
   U.S. Soil Conservation Service ``Curve Number{''} (SCS-CN) method and
   the SCS dimensionless unit hydrograph. This method was selected for
   reasons of data availability and operational simplicity for flood
   managers. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to manipulate
   spatial data for use in the catchment runoff modelling. The results show
   that runoff is predicted to increase as a result of deforestation, which
   is dependent on the proportion of the catchment area affected. However,
   climate change presents a significant flood hazard even in the absence
   of deforestation. Other land use changes may reduce the peak discharges
   of all return period floods. Therefore a future ban on timber
   extraction, combined with agricultural utilisation of rangeland, could
   prove effective as ``nature-based{''} flood reduction measures
   throughout northern Iran.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys the current state of knowledge regarding large-scale
   meteorological patterns (LSMPs) associated with short-duration (less
   than 1 week) extreme precipitation events over North America. In
   contrast to teleconnections, which are typically defined based on the
   characteristic spatial variations of a meteorological field or on the
   remote circulation response to a known forcing, LSMPs are defined
   relative to the occurrence of a specific phenomenon-here, extreme
   precipitation-and with an emphasis on the synoptic scales that have a
   primary influence in individual events, have medium-range weather
   predictability, and are well-resolved in both weather and climate
   models. For the LSMP relationship with extreme precipitation, we
   consider the previous literature with respect to definitions and data,
   dynamical mechanisms, model representation, and climate change trends.
   There is considerable uncertainty in identifying extremes based on
   existing observational precipitation data and some limitations in
   analyzing the associated LSMPs in reanalysis data. Many different
   definitions of ``extreme{''} are in use, making it difficult to directly
   compare different studies. Dynamically, several types of meteorological
   systems-extratropical cyclones, tropical cyclones, mesoscale convective
   systems, and mesohighs-and several mechanisms-fronts, atmospheric
   rivers, and orographic ascent-have been shown to be important aspects of
   extreme precipitation LSMPs. The extreme precipitation is often realized
   through mesoscale processes organized, enhanced, or triggered by the
   LSMP. Understanding of model representation, trends, and projections for
   LSMPs is at an early stage, although some promising analysis techniques
   have been identified and the LSMP perspective is useful for evaluating
   the model dynamics associated with extremes.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the impact on climate change on water resources provides
   useful information for long-term trend analyses of important issues such
   as control of floods, management of drought, agricultural production,
   etc. This work is an attempt to assess the flood events in Vaigai
   watershed, Tamil Nadu (India). The Mann-Kendall test was performed to
   assess the rainfall and temperature trends on data extracted from
   Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Community Climate System Model 4
   (CCSM4) model for historical and future scenarios. The CCSM4 model was
   compared with India Meteorological Department and CRU data sets to
   analyze the performance and consistency of model data among the years of
   flood, viz., 1993, 2010, and 2015. The CCSM4 model was able to capture,
   in a few instances, the historical as well as future flood events over
   the region. The maximum rainfall (738.11 mm) was predicted for 2021
   followed by 2038 and 2040, and the lowest rainfall (43.40 mm) was
   predicted for 2036. Besides, the temperature increased by 1 degrees C
   and rainfall was mostly maximum in September corresponding to the
   south-west monsoon (SWM) season. The predicted increases in rainfall can
   result in flash floods, which have serious implications on the
   agricultural sector and water resources of the basin, while the
   decreasing rainfall during the other seasons helps to reduce the flood
   severity.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The detection of zones exposed to flash-flood and also the torrential
   valleys on which flash-floods are propagated, represents a crucial
   measure intended to eliminate the issues generated by these phenomena.
   In this paper, in order to locate the regions prone to runoff
   occurrence, a number of 4 hybrid models were employed: Naive Bayes -
   Certainty Factor (NB-CF), Naive Bayes-Evidential Belief Function
   (NB-EBF), Multilayer Perceptron - Certainty Factor (MLP - CF) and
   Multilayer Perceptron - Evidential Belief Function (MLP - EBF). The
   first step of the methodology consisted in the mapping of the
   territories with torrential relief microforms. These areas were split
   into training sample (70\%) and validating sample (30\%). By mean of
   Information Gain statistic method, 10 flashflood causal variables were
   chosen to construct the models and to compute the Flash-Flood Potential
   Index values. In order to calculate the Flash Flood Potential Index
   (FFPI) values, the CF and EBF coefficients were determined and,
   subsequently, were incorporated into the NB and MLP models. The results
   of the four hybrid models were validated by using two methods: i)
   relative distribution of torrential pixels within FFPI classes; ii)
   Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC Curve). Since the MLP-CF model
   achieved the best performance, its results have been further used in a
   Flow Accumulation procedure for identifying torrential valleys within
   the research territory. Valleys with a high and very high torrentiality
   degree have a total a length of 1304 km. These valleys were mainly
   developed in the North-Western zone of Prahova river basin.}},

Title = {{Tropical cyclone-Induced heavy rainfall and flow in Colima, Western
   Mexico}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Tropical cyclone (TC) landfall is often accompanied by storm surges,
   strong winds, and heavy rain that cause destructive flash floods,
   especially in mountainous regions. However, there is limited
   understanding of the contribution of TCs to major flood events,
   especially in Western Mexico. In this study, we assess the contribution
   of TCs to the annual rainfall, extreme rainfall and stream flow in the
   mountainous region of Colima, one of the most TC-exposed areas in
   Western Mexico. The top 1\% of daily rainfall and stream flow, annual
   maximum rainfall and the highest 20 stream flow events from 1970 to 2015
   are examined for their association to TCs. Results indicate that the
   relative contribution of TCs to the average annual rainfall can exceed
   25\% in the coastal area of Colima. Over 25-35\% of heavy daily rainfall
   (top 1\% rainfall) recorded in the coastal rain gauges is found to be
   associated with TCs. In terms of high flow, approximately 20-24\% of the
   top 1\% flow events and 28-35\% (similar to 7 events) of the top 20 flow
   events are driven by TCs. The heaviest precipitation and high flow
   events occur typically in the late TC season (September and October).
   Our results provide insights on the role of TCs in inducing rainfall and
   stream flow relevant for water and flood risk management.}},

Abstract = {{Changes to precipitation patterns and extremes over the Nepalese
   Himalayas were examined using a high-resolution, station-based daily
   dataset, Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data
   Integration Towards Evaluation (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees APHRODITE)
   from 1951 to 2007. The annual statistics of extreme precipitation across
   Nepal show a significant increase since the end of the 20th century.
   However, seasonal mean precipitation shows a remarkable decrease in
   western Nepal, particularly since 1980, forming an east-west division in
   the precipitation change. This decreasing trend of precipitation led to
   a reduction to the dry-season stream flow of Karnali River, the major
   river in western Nepal. At the same time, the increasing extreme
   precipitation produced greater threat of flash flood in Nepal. This
   east-west division of the precipitation trend agrees with the second
   leading mode of the mean precipitation variability, which was traced to
   the interannual variability of the Indian Ocean sea surface temperature
   that showed a slowdown of warming. Similar to the APHRODITE trends,
   precipitation simulated by the fifth phase of the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models depicted the decreasing

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to provide an evaluation of the impact of two
   largely used data assimilation techniques, namely three- and
   four-dimensional variational data assimilation systems (3D-Var and
   4D-Var), on the forecasting of heavy precipitation events using the
   Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. For this purpose, two
   flash flood events in central Italy are analysed. The first occurred on
   September 14, 2012 during an Intensive Observation Period of the
   Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean experiment (HyMeX) campaign,
   while the other occurred on May 3, 2018. Radial velocity and
   reflectivity acquired by C-band weather radars at Mt. Midia (central
   Italy) and San Pietro Capofiume (northern Italy), as well as
   conventional observations (SYNOP and TEMP), are assimilated into the WRF
   model to simulate these damaging flash flood events. In order to
   evaluate the impact of the 3D-Var and 4D-Var assimilation systems on the
   estimation of short-term quantitative precipitation forecasts, several
   experiments are carried out using conventional observations with and
   without radar data. Rainfall evaluation is performed by means of
   point-by-point and filtering methodologies. The results point to a
   positive impact of the 4D-Var technique compared to results without
   assimilation and with 3D-Var experiments. More specifically, the 4D-Var
   system produces an increase of up to 22\% in terms of the Fractions
   Skill Score compared to 3D-Var for the first flash flood event, while an
   increase of about 5\% is achieved for the second event. The use of a
   warm start initialization results in a considerable reduction in the
   spin-up time and a significant improvement in the rainfall forecast,
   suggesting that the initial precipitation spin-up problem still occurs
   when using 4D-Var.}},

Title = {{Joint Sensing of Bedload Flux and Water Depth by Seismic Data Inversion}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Rivers are the fluvial conveyor belts routing sediment across the
   landscape. While there are proper techniques for continuous estimates of
   the flux of suspended solids, constraining bedload flux is much more
   challenging, typically involving extensive measurement infrastructure or
   labor-intensive manual measurements. Seismometers are potentially
   valuable alternatives to in-stream devices, delivering continuous data
   with high temporal resolution on the average behavior of a reach. Two
   models exist to predict the seismic spectra generated by river
   turbulence and bedload flux. However, these models require estimating a
   large number of parameters and the spectra usually overlap
   significantly, which hinders straightforward inversion. We provide three
   functions contained in the R package ``eseis{''} that allow generic
   modeling of hydraulic and bedload transport dynamics from seismic data
   using these models. The underlying Monte Carlo approach creates lookup
   tables of potential spectra, which are compared against the empirical
   spectra to identify the best fitting solutions. The method is validated
   against synthetic data sets and independently measured metrics from the
   Nahal Eshtemoa, Israel, a flash flood-dominated ephemeral gravel bed
   river. Our approach reproduces the synthetic time series with average
   absolute deviations of 0.01-0.04 m (water depth, ranging between 0 and 1
   m) and 0.00-0.04 kg/sm (bedload flux, ranging between 0 and 4 kg/sm).
   The example flash flood water depths and bedload fluxes are reproduced
   with respective average deviations of 0.10 m and 0.02 kg/sm. Our
   approach thus provides generic, testable, and reproducible routines for
   a quantitative description of key metrics, hard to collect by other
   techniques in a continuous and representative manner.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are a recurrent hazard for many developing Latin American
   regions due to their complex mountainous terrain and the rainfall
   characteristics in the tropics. These regions often lack the timely and
   high-quality information needed to assess, in real time, the threats to
   the vulnerable communities due to extreme hydrometeorological events.
   The systematic assessment of past extreme events allows us to improve
   our prediction capabilities of flash floods. In May 2015, a flash flood
   in the La Liboriana basin, municipality of Salgar, Colombia, caused more
   than 100 casualties and significant infrastructure damage. Despite the
   data scarcity, the climatological aspects, meteorological conditions,
   and first-order hydrometeorological mechanisms associated with the La
   Liboriana flash flood, including orographic intensification and the
   spatial distribution of the rainfall intensity relative to the basin's
   geomorphological features, are studied using precipitation information
   obtained using a weather radar quantitative precipitation estimation
   (QPE) technique, as well as from satellite products, in situ rain gauges
   from neighboring basins, quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs)
   from an operational Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)
   application, and data from reanalysis products. The La Liboriana flash
   flood took place during a period with negative precipitation anomalies
   over most of the country as a result of an El Nino event. However,
   during May 2015, moist easterly flow towards the upper part of La
   Liboriana caused significant orographic rainfall enhancement. The
   overall evidence shows an important role of successive precipitation
   events in a relatively short period and of orography in the spatial
   distribution of rainfall and its intensification as convective cores
   approached the steepest topography. There were three consecutive events
   generating significant rainfall within the La Liboriana basin, and no
   single precipitation event was exceptionally large enough to generate
   the flash flood, but rather the combined role of precedent rainfall and
   the extreme hourly precipitation triggered the event. The results point
   to key lessons for improving local risk reduction strategies in
   vulnerable regions with complex terrain.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change may considerably influence flash floods by increasing
   extreme precipitation. Coastal regions in eastern and southern China may
   experience especially negative effects because of the frequent
   occurrence of tropical cyclones (TCs). This study presented a hazard
   assessment framework for TCs-induced flash floods under dimate change
   scenarios and assessed future inundations in Hadahe River basin, which
   is in northeastern China. From 1965 to 2014, there were twenty-four TCs
   ranging from severe tropical storm to super typhoon over Hadahe River
   basin in twenty years. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are too coarse
   to depict the impact of TCs on extreme precipitation; therefore, hourly
   precipitation data from two gauges and the tracks of TCs were used to
   assess the impact of TCs. An extreme precipitation event on 3-4 August
   2012 and the same 600-year future probabilistic extreme rainfall were
   utilized to investigate the impact of climate change. Daily
   precipitation data from eight climate models from the NEX-GDDP dataset
   during 1965-2005 and 2050-2099 represented historical and future
   simulation conditions, respectively. The hydrologic model HEC-HMS was
   integrated with the hydraulic model FLO-2D to simulate discharges and
   inundations of past and future TCs episodes. The results showed that
   flooded area is projected to increase by 6.6\% and 7.8\% for inundation
   depth between 1.0 and 3.0 m under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios,
   respectively. For inundation depth over 3.0 m, flooded area is projected
   to increase by 17.6\% and 22.0\%. Relative change of flash flood extent
   increases as inundation depth increases, indicating that climate change
   is likely to increase the risk of flash floods. Additional adaptation
   measures are needed to make the Hadahe River basin and other similar
   coastal basins more resilient. The results also indicated that
   considering the impact of TCs produces a more reliable assessment of
   future flash floods in coastal regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Changes in future rainfall extremes over Northeast Bangladesh: A
   Bayesian model averaging approach}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we used a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach to
   analyse the changes in rainfall extremes in the periods 2041-2070 and
   2071-2099 over northeast Bangladesh as a consequence of climate change.
   Climate change over this region could potentially impact agricultural
   production, water resources management, and the overall economy of the
   country. We used six regional climate models (RCMs) over the Coordinated
   Regional Downscaling Experiment South Asia domain. We used one medium
   stabilization scenario (RCP4.5) and one high-emission scenario (RCP8.5)
   for projecting the extreme rainfall indices. A multi-model ensemble mean
   was generated using the BMA approach. The BMA mean is a weighted average
   related to each RCM's predictive skill during the training period. Most
   of the rainfall extremes are expected to increase in both pre-monsoon
   (March-May) and monsoon (June-September) seasons in the future compared
   with baseline (1976-2005). The average pre-monsoon rainfall of the study
   area is projected to increase by 12.93 and 18.42\% under RCP4.5 and
   18.18 and 23.85\% under RCP8.5 for the periods 2041-2070 and 2071-2099,
   respectively. The average monsoon rainfall of the study area is
   projected to increase by 4.96 and 2.27\% under RCP4.5 and 6.56 and
   6.40\% under RCP8.5 for the periods 2041-2070 and 2071-2099,
   respectively. All the extreme indices except consecutive wet day are
   expected to change significantly at the 95\% confidence level during the
   pre-monsoon season. The study area will potentially be subjected to more
   frequent floods in the future both in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons as
   a consequence of climate change. Notably, the intensity and the
   magnitude of flash flooding in the pre-monsoon season are expected to
   increase more in the future because the increase in extreme indices is
   more significant during that season.}},

Abstract = {{An extraordinary convective rainfall event, unforeseen by most numerical
   weather prediction models, generated a devastating flash flood (305 m(3)
   s(-1)) in the town of Sant Llorenc des Cardassar, Mallorca, on 9 October
   2018. Four people died inside this village, while casualties were up to
   13 over the entire affected area. This extreme event has been
   reconstructed by implementing an integrated flash flood modelling
   approach in the Ses Planes catchment up to Sant Llorenc (23.4 km(2)),
   based on three components: (i) generation of radar-derived precipitation
   estimates, (ii) modelling of accurate discharge hydrographs yielded by
   the catchment (using FEST and KLEM models), and (iii) hydraulic
   simulation of the event and mapping of affected areas (using HEC-RAS).
   Radar-derived rainfall estimates show very high agreement with rain
   gauge data (R-2 = 0.98). Modelled flooding extent is in close agreement
   with the observed extension by the Copernicus Emergency Management
   Service, based on Sentinel-1 imagery, and both far exceed the extension
   for a 500-year return period flood. Hydraulic simulation revealed that
   water reached a depth of 3 m at some points, and modelled water depths
   highly correlate (R-2 = 0.91) with in situ after-event measurements. The
   9 October flash flood eroded and transported woody and abundant sediment
   debris, changing channel geomorphology. Water velocity greatly increased
   at bridge locations crossing the river channel, especially at those
   closer to the Sant Llorenc town centre. This study highlights how the
   very low predictability of this type of extreme convective rainfall
   events and the very short hydrological response times typical of small
   Mediterranean catchments continue to challenge the implementation of
   early warning systems, which effectively reduce people's exposure to
   flash flood risk in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Flash-flood is considered to be one of the most destructive natural
   hazards in the world, which is difficult to accurately model and
   predict. The objective of the present research is to propose new
   ensembles of bivariate statistics and artificial intelligences and to
   introduce a comprehensive methodology for predicting flood
   susceptibility. The Putna river catchment of Romania is selected as a
   case study. In this regard, a total of six ensemble models were proposed
   and verified: Multilayer Perceptron neural network-Frequency Ratio
   (MLP-FR), Multilayer Perceptron neural network-Weights of Evidence
   (MLP-WOE), Rotation Forest-Frequency Ratio (RF-FR), Rotation
   Forest-Weights of Evidence (RF-WOE), Classification and Regression
   Tree-Frequency Ratio (CART-FR), and Classification and Regression
   Tree-Weights of Evidence (CART-WOE). In a first step, a geospatial
   database was created for the study area. This database includes 132
   flood locations and 14 conditioning factors (lithology, slope angle,
   plan curvature, hydrological soil group, topographic wetness index,
   landuse, convergence index, elevation, distance from river, profile
   curvature, rainfall, aspect, stream power index, and topographic
   position index). In the next step, the Information Gain Ratio was used
   to evaluate the predictive ability of these factors. Subsequently, the
   database was used to train and validate the six ensemble models. The
   Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve
   (AUC), and statistical measures were used to evaluate the performance of
   the models. The results show that the prediction capability of the
   proposed ensemble models varied from 86.8\% (the RF-FR model) to 93.9\%
   (the RF-WOE model). These values indicate a high prediction performance
   for all the models. Therefore, we can state that the proposed ensemble
   models are new reliable tools which can be used for flood susceptibility
   modelling. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The HyMeX international research project (Hydrological cycle in the
   Mediterranean eXperiment, ), as part of the multi-agency MISTRALS
   program launched in 2010 for a 10-y period, aims at advancing our
   understanding of the water cycle in the Mediterranean, and in particular
   to improve knowledge and forecasting of hydrometeorological risks. At
   the heart of the HyMeX project, are the study and forecasting of heavy
   precipitation and flash flood events that regularly affect the
   Mediterranean region. After a presentation of the general observation
   strategy which combined research field campaigns, reinforcement of
   observations during several autumns and collections of
   socio-hydrological data after the major events in the region during the
   period, an overall review of the scientific advances made since the
   launch of HyMeX is given both in terms of knowledge and modelling of
   Mediterranean episodes of intense rainfall and their impacts, and in
   terms of evaluation and improvement of forecasting methods and systems,
   in particular short-term hydrometeorological ensemble forecasting
   systems based on the numerical weather prediction model AROME of
   Meteo-France.}},

Abstract = {{The national warning system, Vigicrues Flash, developed by the French
   national service in charge of flood forecasting (SCHAPI), provides flash
   flood warnings at ungauged locations based on a discharge-threshold
   flood warning method called AIGA. The AIGA method leads to characterize
   flood hazard in real time at any point along the river network. A
   simplified hourly-distributed hydrologic model ingests the operational
   radar-based Quantitative Precipitation Estimate grids from Meteo-France
   at a 1-km(2) resolution to produce real-time peak discharge estimates
   along the river network. Every 15 minutes, these discharges are compared
   to reference flood quantiles, which were estimated from streamflow
   simulated time series (using the same model). A web interface provides
   in real time maps of the rivers exceeding the high flood and very high
   flood thresholds, as well as the associated municipalities. The
   automated system sends warning messages to registered users who might be
   impacted to help them better mitigate flood risk impacts. To better
   detect and anticipate flash flooding, the hydrologic model is being
   enhanced to ingest the Meteo-France's AROME-NWC high-resolution
   precipitation nowcasts, provided at a 1.3-km resolution for a 6-hr
   forecast horizon, and hourly updated. To account for the forecast
   uncertainties, the deterministic AROME-NWC forecasts are ingested as
   time-lagged ensembles and combined with multiple sets of hydrological
   regionalized parameters. The resulting flow ensembles lead to define
   probabilistic flood warnings. The evaluation, carried out on 13
   significant events from October 2015 to June 2017 for 750 French basins,
   shows significant improvements in terms of flash flood event detection
   and effective warning lead time, compared to warnings from the current
   Vigicrues Flash setup (without any future precipitation), and the added
   value of probabilistic warnings.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean flash floods can have dramatic consequences and it is
   crucial to increase the lead time for those flash floods to better
   anticipate their impact. But the hydrometeorological forecast is
   affected by several sources of uncertainty. The major uncertainty comes
   from the precipitation forecasts used to drive the hydrological models.
   The knowledge of the initial soil moisture and the hydrological model
   itself are also affected by uncertainty. In this work, several
   hydrometeorological ensemble prediction systems are designed and
   compared to sample these uncertainties. They are based on the AROME
   kilometer-scale atmospheric model and the ISBA-TOP coupled system, which
   is dedicated to Mediterranean fast responding catchments. Uncertainty in
   rainfall prediction is sampled using the AROME-EPS, ensemble prediction
   with AROME, to drive ISBA-TOP, or perturbing the AROME deterministic
   outputs. Those perturbations come from a climatology of rainfall
   prediction errors. To consider the uncertainties of hydrological
   modeling and initial soil moisture conditions, a perturbation method of
   the most sensitive parameters of ISBA-TOP and of initial soil moisture
   has been designed. The precipitation scenarios issued by AROME-EPS are
   then used to drive a version of ISBA-TOP where these parameter and
   initial conditions perturbation methods are applied. Evaluated on
   several basins and case studies, the so-built prediction system properly
   encompasses observed discharges. A reasonable number of members allows
   better skill for discharge prediction than a deterministic forecasting
   system.}},

Abstract = {{The city of Nimes is exposed to flood risks (especially to flash
   floods). No major river flows in the dense urban area of the city.
   Instead, dry canals called ``cadereaux{''} cross the city and are used
   to collect water runoff. The Mediterranean rains, the small catchment
   basins (size under 30 km(2)) and the karstic type as well as the
   piedmont situation are factors bringing about significant runoff with
   major overflow and flash floods. After the floods that took place on the
   3rd of October 1988, the city of Nimes launched a new ambitious policy
   aiming at preventing flooding risks, including important works on the
   ``cadereaux{''}. In 2004, as part of this process, the city implemented
   an alert system ESPADA (Evaluation et suivi des precipitations en
   agglomeration pour devancer l'alerte). The goal of this system is to
   forecast the ``cadereaux{''} flow rates up to 1 h 30 ahead, by using a
   hydrological model with sharp representation of the karstic ecosystem.
   In 2014, within the framework of the Programs of Actions for Inundations
   Prevention, the city of Nimes initiated the modernization of the ESPADA
   system to improve the quality of the input data in real time (5-min time
   step). A radio network dedicated to the collection of the data (through
   the city's hydrometeorological sensors) was put in place, thus offering
   a secure and efficient data collection. The radio network also enables
   real-time data collection from the SPC-GD (Service de prevision des
   crues du Grand Delta, regional office in charge of flood prevention)
   stations. Furthermore, the city developed a high resolution spatial
   radar which enables rain measurement and forecasting. By using 500 m
   pixels waves, this tool can identify local intensities on the small
   drainage basins. Data calibration is made with rain gauges which are
   available. As part of the second step of modernization, the forecasting
   model is now being improved in order to work continuously with 5-min
   time step. The propagation is managed by 1D hydraulic model. In
   addition, the linmnigraphic data are used in real time to update the
   flow rates values and the storage levels of the basins. Similarly, a web
   interface is currently under development, allowing crisis-management
   key-players to efficiently use the risk mitigation tools. Over time, the
   general public will have access to some of the ESPADA system, using an
   interface similar to the Vigicrues portal.}},

Abstract = {{After different failures observed in the use of church tombs for
   alerting the population during the early 1930 and under a passive
   defense following the Second World War, the French government have
   decided to deploy the National Alert Network (NAN) since 1954. The
   signal sent by the sirens was intended to interrupt all the social
   activities, and the sound was likely to induce ``adapted{''} behavior by
   the concerned authorities but also by the inhabitants. However, the NAN
   remains often not used to alert population, as recalled after the flash
   floods observed in the Aude basin river the 2018, October 15th. Thus,
   this article involves to a further assessment and evaluation of supports
   and drawbacks of the NAN face to flash floods. Results obtained in the
   department of Vaucluse confirm that most of the sirens are not located
   in sensitive areas, thus we cannot hope to use such notifications for
   alerting the populations. Several improvements are explored, namely
   because the government has decided to replace this NAN with a new
   system, SAIP (System of Alert and Information for the Population), whose
   deployment began at the metropolitan scale in 2017 and whose
   operationality is expected for 2022.}},

Abstract = {{The 15th of June 2010 an exceptional flash flood occurred in the Var
   region in southeastern France. This flood caused 25 casualties and
   catastrophic damages in the area of Draguignan. After this event several
   researchers and engineers teams conducted field surveys in order to
   gather information on the dynamics of the flood: peak discharge
   estimates for the main Argens River and all the tributaries hit by the
   event, and information on the chronology of the flood based on
   interviews of eyewitnesses. The SCHAPI and the DREAL PACA organised
   exchanges between the different teams involved in order to ensure a
   global coherence of discharge estimates, and to examine the question of
   the possible return period of the flood. This work of comparison
   revealed that despite the several sources of uncertainty, the discharge
   estimates proposed by the different teams were relatively close to each
   other. This work finally led to a complete cartography of peak
   discharges including almost 40 local estimates. The spatial repartition
   of peak discharges appears coherent with rainfall accumulations
   estimated based on radar data. A more detailed hydrological analysis of
   the flood was then conducted based on the comparison of estimated peak
   discharges and hydrographs simulated using a simple distributed
   rainfall-runoff model. This analysis revealed a great disparity of the
   hydrological answer of the tributaries of the Argens River. The
   strongest reactions were observed on the Florieye and the Real Rivers
   for which rainfall accumulations exceeded 350 mm in 24 h. The Aille
   River also had a strong reaction despite of much more limited rainfall
   accumulations on this watershed (up to 250 mm). On the other hand, the
   Nartuby River showed a very attenuated answer despite of very elevated
   rainfall accumulations (exceeding 300 mm): this could be attributed to
   the presence of large karst formations in this last watershed. Lastly,
   the discussion on the return periods of the flood enabled to identify
   the river reaches where a 100-year return period had probably been
   exceeded.}},

Title = {{Flood hazard risk forecasting index (FHRFI) for urban areas: The
   Hurricane Harvey case study}},
Journal = {{METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Hurricane Harvey caused at least 70 confirmed deaths, with estimated
   losses in the Houston urban area of Texas reaching above US\$150
   billion, making it one of the costliest natural disasters ever in the
   United States. The study tests two types of forecast index to provide
   surface flooding (inundation) warning over the Houston area: a
   meteorological index based on a global numerical weather prediction
   (NWP) system, and a new combined meteorological and land surface index,
   the flood hazard risk forecasting index (FHRFI), where land surface is
   used to condition the meteorological forecast. Both indices use the
   total precipitation extreme forecast index (EFI) and shift of tails
   (SoT) products from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF) medium-range ensemble forecasting system (ENS).
   Forecasts at the medium range (3-14 days ahead) were assessed against
   153 observed National Weather Service (NWS) urban flood reports over the
   Houston urban area between August 26 and 29, 2017. It is shown that the
   method provides skilful forecasts up to four days ahead using both
   approaches. Moreover, the FHRFI combined index has a hit ratio of up to
   74\% at 72 hr lead time, with a false-alarm ratio of only 45\%. This
   amounts to a statistically significant 20\% increase in performance
   compared with the meteorological indices. This first study demonstrates
   the importance of including land-surface information to improve the
   quality of the flood forecasts over meteorological indices only, and
   that skilful flood warning in urban areas can be obtained from the NWP
   using the FHRFI.}},

Title = {{Reconstruction of Seasonal Net Erosion in a Mediterranean Landscape
   (Alento River Basin, Southern Italy) over the Past Five Decades}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the low Mediterranean basin, late spring and autumn rainfall events
   have the potential to increase discharge and transport substantial
   amounts of sediment soil (that is, the net soil erosion from a
   watershed). For the Alento River Basin (ARB), located in the low
   Tyrrhenian coast of Italy, we estimated changes of net erosion as
   dependent on the seasonality of antecedent soil moisture and its control
   on rainfall-runoff and erosivity. Based on rainfall and runoff erosivity
   sub-models, we developed a simplified model to evaluate basin-wide
   sediment yields on a monthly basis by upscaling point rainfall input.
   For the period 1951-2018, the reconstruction of a time series of monthly
   net erosion data indicated a decreasing trend of the sediment yield
   after 1991. Revegetation and land abandonment that occurred in the last
   decades can explain such a decrease of net erosion, which occurred even
   when rainfall erosivity increased. This response, obtained at the basic
   scale, does not exclude that rapidly developing mesoscale convective
   systems, typically responsible for the heaviest and most destructive
   rainfall events in the ARB, can affect small catchments, which are the
   most vulnerable systems to storm-driven flash floods and soil erosion
   hazards during soil tilling in spring and at beginning of autumn.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, as extreme weather increasingly threatens human health and
   economy, early warning system approaches are critical for timely
   preparedness and response. Towards the implementation of a multi-model
   forecasting system for flood hazards, this study presents a coupled
   application of three (3) models: The WRF-ARW weather model, the
   WRF-Hydro hydrological model, and the HEC-RAS 2D hydraulic model. A
   flash flood event that occurred on 9 October 2006 in Volos city, Greece,
   is used as a case study to assess the accuracy of the integrated
   modelling approach to simulate the flood hydrograph and flood extent in
   Xerias ungauged catchment. The hydrometeorological simulation results
   indicated a severe persistent storm over Pelion mountain at the
   northeast of Volos, as the main factor of the major flash flood and
   extensive impacts. Historical flood records retrieved by several
   conventional and non-conventional sources are used to validate the
   flooded area. Compared to the collected data and prior studies, the
   generated inundation map of Xerias river is found to realistically
   capture highly impacted areas which experienced infrastructure damage
   and human rescues from inundated roads and buildings. Results from our
   analyses show that the proposed physically-based modelling approach can
   give reliable inputs into flood risk management.}},

Title = {{Analysis of a Flash Flood in a Small Basin in Crete}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Climate change will have a greater impact on the severity of flash
   floods, since precipitation intensity is expected to increase, even in
   areas where a reduction of precipitation is possible. This change in
   climate is expected to increase flood wave speed and its flood wave area
   extent. A case study of a small basin in the island of Crete was
   conducted to examine this effect, following the calibration and
   validation of the flow hydrograph of a flash flood event, in order to
   achieve model verification with the post-flood data. It was found that
   the most important parameters that affect the timing and magnitude of
   the peak discharge are the storage coefficient, the impervious rate and
   the curve number, as well as the time of concentration. Rainfall
   distribution was examined in different time intervals in order to study
   the effect of the intensity of precipitation on the peak hydrograph.
   From the precipitation records and according to the size of the
   watershed, the time step of the precipitation in the simulation model is
   recommended to be less than an hour. In other areas around the basin of
   interest, severe storms known as Medicanes that pass over Crete can
   produce higher precipitation in shorter time intervals. The impact of
   climate change scenarios results in an increase on the peak discharge by
   creating precipitation of higher intensity. Furthermore, the
   intensification of precipitation due to climate change results in higher
   flood depths and flooded area extent, as well as wave velocities.}},

Title = {{Drivers of climate over the Western Himalayan region of India: A review}},
Journal = {{EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Himalayas popularly known as the `Third Pole' and `Water tower' of
   Asia has attracted global attention under the context of climate change
   as rainfall in this region has decreased drastically, and temperature
   has risen very rapidly in the last century. Present study was attempted
   to quantify such abnormal warming and unexpected declining trend of
   rainfall vis-a-vis to identify factors influencing such abnormal
   behavior over the complex physiographical region technically known as
   Western Himalaya Region (WHR) through the available literature therein.
   It was revealed that frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall and
   temperature events have risen due to the variation of local weather
   events while mean climate has altered due to the influence of
   large-scale circulations like the Indian monsoon, Western Disturbances,
   and change in teleconnection pattern. Why the WHR has been a hotspot of
   several hazards like the cloudburst, Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF),
   convective storms, and forest fires in the past have been answered with
   appropriate evidence. Feedback from different atmospheric factors like
   snow-albedo, black carbon, and other suspended particulates was
   discussed in details to understand the complex nature of the Himalayan
   climate. WHR may face higher magnitude of heavy and extreme rainfall
   because of its accelerated warming. Information assembled in the present
   paper will be considered as a valuable resource document for the remote
   and vulnerable geographical locations of WHR, where research and
   developmental activities lag due to unavailability of adequate data and
   its quality and insufficient information and its proper access in a
   concise form.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{578}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are among the most disastrous natural hazards worldwide
   because of their rapid onset that limits effective emergency response
   and management. Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of
   flash floods can help emergency managers and stakeholders in devising
   solutions to mitigate the associated risks and damages. In this study, a
   data-driven approach is employed to characterize flash flood hazard
   across the contiguous United States (CONUS). The National Weather
   Service (NWS) Storm Events database is utilized, and a total of 74,814
   flash flood events are assessed during 1996-2017. The frequency,
   duration, property damages, and fatalities of flash floods are
   investigated across spatial domains (i.e. county, state, regional, and
   entire CONUS) and multiple temporal scales (i.e. annual, seasonal,
   monthly, and diurnal). Results indicate that flash flood frequency has
   slightly increased over the CONUS in the past 22 years, and the property
   damages have substantially raised. Flash floods are found to be more
   frequent in summer and less frequent but longer in winter. Our analyses
   indicate distinct regional patterns for duration of median versus
   extreme flash floods. In addition, the diurnal distribution of flash
   floods indicate that they are more likely to initiate in the evening and
   terminate around midnight. The average duration of flash floods in the
   past 22 years has been about 3.5 h, yet in some rare cases, they
   persisted for about two days. The findings of this study can shed light
   on flash flood hazard across the CONUS, which can be useful for
   mitigating flash flood risks.}},

   discharge measurement in mountain river flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{578}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) has been successfully
   applied for stream flow and flood measurements. In most LSPIV studies,
   the water surface has been approximated as a two-dimensional planar
   surface. Errors may arise due to this approximation for flows in steep
   channels and with complex riverbed topography, especially for small
   mountain rivers. In this study, a Stereo Imaging based LSPIV system
   (SI-LSPIV) is developed to reconstruct the three-dimensional topography
   and water surface distribution, in addition to surface velocity
   measurements. The SI-LSPIV system consists of two synchronized Raspberry
   Pi camera modules that can capture stereo images autonomously.
   Uncalibrated rectification and point cloud methods are implemented for
   surface reconstruction. Detailed three-dimensional surface topography as
   well as water level distribution can be obtained, which facilitates
   image ortho-rectification and wetted-area delineation for LSPIV
   calculation. Over the past years, an unattended SI-LSPIV system has been
   deployed in Longxi River, Sichuan, China. One major flow event was
   captured and the results were presented to demonstrate that LSPIV
   analysis aided with three-dimensional water surface distribution can
   improve velocity measurement and stream discharge estimation for
   torrential mountain river flows.}},

Journal = {{ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{114}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Tertiary palaeodrainage system in the Namibian calcrete-uranium
   province is deeply buried under Cenozoic sediments (such as fluvial,
   alluvial and desert flash-flood terrace sediments, duricrusts and/or
   aeolian and fluvially reworked aeolian sands) and has no obvious surface
   expression, because of which, this province remains under-explored in
   spite of hosting the world's largest calcrete-uranium deposit at Langer
   Heinrich. This paper presents first-pass bedrock geology and bedrock
   topography models for the Namibian calcrete-uranium province generated
   using air-borne magnetic data, which are further used to delineate
   subsurface Tertiary palaeochannels in the province. Conjunctive
   interpretations of surface geology, bedrock geology, and bedrock
   topography indicated that the major underlying controls on the spatial
   distribution and configuration of the Tertiary palaeochannels in the
   Namibian province are both lithological and structural; however, the
   basement structural fabric that formed during the Damaran orogeny
   possibly exerts a fundamental control on both palaeodrainage as well as
   present drainage. The analysis also indicated that the carnotite
   deposition in the Langer Heinrich palaeochannel is possibly a
   consequence of westward reorientation of the course of the proto-Swakop
   river. Finally, the paper presents a manual prospectivity analysis of
   the province for calcrete-uranium deposits, which resulted in the
   demarcation of five prospective sections of palaeochannels in the Tumas
   Basin, Swakop River and Khan River terraces and in the Gawib Flats (west
   of the Langer Heinrich Deposit).}},

Abstract = {{Cities increasingly use real-time control of combined sewer systems and
   green infrastructure to decrease emissions to surface waters, and
   incorporate infrastructure into the urban landscape to reduce flooding
   from short, intense rainfall events called cloudbursts, which can cause
   flash flooding. Inspired by the `smart cities' agenda, we propose the
   use of integrated stormwater inflow control to dynamically activate
   cloudburst conveyance infrastructure in the urban landscape as well as
   green storage elements more often than originally intended. This control
   facilitates synergy between sewers, green infrastructure and the urban
   landscape, and has lower environmental impacts than isolated control
   approaches. A simulated, yet realistic, case study in Copenhagen,
   Denmark, shows that combined sewage emissions can be eliminated or
   reduced substantially in this manner. Other potential benefits include
   increasing amenity value and educating citizens, for example. The
   results suggest that the proposed control concept potentially provides a
   viable path towards more resilient, liveable and sustainable cities.}},

Abstract = {{The deep sea has long been a mysterious and attractive habitat for
   protistologists. However, logistical difficulties severely limit
   sampling opportunities. Consequently, our knowledge of the protists in
   the deep sea, (arguably the largest habitat on earth), is relatively
   sparse. Here, we present a unique time-series concerning three different
   protist taxa that share only the characteristics of being relatively
   large, robust to sampling, and easily identifiable to species level
   using light microscopy: tintinnid ciliates, phaeogromid cercozoans (e.g.
   Challengerids) and amphisolenid dinoflagellates. We sampled a near-shore
   deep water site in the N.W. Mediterranean Sea at 250 m depth over a 2-yr
   period at approximately weekly intervals from January 2017 to December
   2018. To our knowledge, no previous studies have employed sampling on a
   similar time scale. We found taxa that appear to be restricted to deep
   waters, distinct seasonal patterns of abundance in some taxa, and in
   others nonseasonal successional patterns. Based on data from sampling
   following a flash flood event, the Challengerid population appeared to
   respond positively to a pulse of terrigenous input. Some of the distinct
   mesopelagic tintinnid ciliates and amphisolinid dinoflagellates were
   also found in two samples from the North Atlantic mesopelagic gathered
   from near the Azores Islands in September 2018. We conclude that there
   are a variety of protist taxa endemic to the mesopelagic, that the
   populations are dynamic, and they may be widely distributed in the deep
   waters of the world ocean.}},

Abstract = {{On December 2, 1959, the Malpasset arch dam in southeast France suddenly
   failed, flooding the valley down to the sea, causing huge destruction
   and more than 400 casualties. Built from 1952 to 1954 for water supply
   and irrigation, filling of the reservoir was delayed five years and the
   failure occurred following a flash flood of the river the dam was
   closing. Post failure studies and expertise during a trial revealed poor
   field investigations on a micaschist rock foundation crisscrossed by
   faults, and poor management of construction of the structure. The
   failure was ascribed to uplift, moving a rock dihedron defined by a
   conspicuous fault and a tear along foliation. This paper shows that, in
   addition to the many traps listed by previous investigations (mostly
   geological and geotechnical), the human and organizational factors can
   also shed a new light on this catastrophe. Keeping lessons from
   Malpasset alive and increasing the knowledge about this case is relevant
   since worldwide, after the catastrophe, not only did new regulations on
   dams appear but also both fields of geological engineering and rock
   mechanics were developed. Thus, consciously or not, every geological
   engineer or rock mechanics specialists is somehow, a descendant of this
   case.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal environment with high interaction between nature and societies
   is subject to multi-hazard interaction such as landslides, flood or
   cliff retreat. These territories are characterized by numerous elements
   at risk located in valley bottoms, front sea or at the outlets of small
   dry watershed. The aim is to quantify the potential consequences of EaR
   by integrating multiple hazards exposure at various scale analyses. To
   quantify the element at risk, three steps have been required. First, an
   initial rank has been attributed to each class of element at risk at
   three different scales analysis. Second, the potential consequences are
   weighted according to environmental dimension. Third, the consequences
   are combined with a linear combination of criteria in GIS environment.
   At medium-scale analysis, element at risk highlighted is built-up areas,
   national road, railway, lifeline and urban centers. At large-scale
   analysis, consequences concern any kind of house, apartment and complex
   located on multiple exposure areas. At local scale, consequences concern
   buildings located on multiple exposure areas with one floor in mixed
   materials and built after 1980. Thus, this method proposes an approach
   with multiple scales analysis and by integrating multiple exposure areas
   to quantify potential consequences. With the environmental dimension in
   element at risk analysis, it is an intermediate step to traditional risk
   analysis and, more specifically multirisk analysis without considering
   in this case the spatial and temporal dimension of hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods caused by extreme rainfalls are one of the most significant
   natural hazards. In the present study, the precipitation data of 69
   meteorological and climatological stations with temporal intervals
   (1961-2010) were obtained to determine the threshold of extreme
   precipitation as well as analyzing its significant patterns in the
   western regions of Iran. To determine the threshold of extreme
   precipitation, the theory of extreme value method was applied. In this
   method, precipitation of 22 mm and more than that covers 30\% of the
   area had been identified and extracted as extreme precipitation.
   Therefore, 119 extreme precipitation events during the study period had
   been identified. Then, four patterns were analyzed using cluster
   analysis. After that, network data of geopotential height levels of 200,
   300, 400 and 500 hPa for these days, from re-analyzed data series of
   NCEP/NCAR in the range of 10 degrees-80 degrees E and 0 degrees-70
   degrees N and in 13,460 cells 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees were extracted
   by GrADS software. The results of the study showed that the most
   important humidity source for precipitation was the Mediterranean Sea,
   the Black Sea and the Red Sea, respectively. The upward vertical speed
   at different levels, located on the east and southeast cyclones of upper
   levels, which matches low pressure of the Earth's surface, indicating
   unstable conditions in the region. Also, placing cutoff lows due to
   westerlies activities with warm and humid air advection at the surface
   and upper-level cold air were the main causes of severe atmospheric

Abstract = {{The applications of remote sensing in monitoring land cover features are
   an essential tool of natural resources management schemes. The
   sedimentation mapping of shallow shorelines is insufficient using
   passive remote sensing images because of the image corrections and
   weather implications that need to be considered, while active remote
   sensing data can overcome the difficulties of the weather interference
   and reach to more reliable results. The current research work took place
   in the shoreline on Umluj city, west of Saudi Arabia, representing one
   of the most sensitive wetland habitats within the country. Sentinel-1
   images were downloaded and analyzed to delineate the sedimentation
   process from the European Space Agency. The archive image was acquired
   in August 2018, while the crisis emerged was acquired in March 2019
   after an unusual rainfall event that took place in the vicinity of the
   study area. Remote sensing techniques of sedimentation mapping end
   change detection were implemented in the study area to estimate the
   sedimentation process and its influences on the wetlands. The wetland
   habitats were decreased by nearly 87\% throughout the period of flash
   floods between November 2018 and March 2019. Meanwhile, sediment
   deposits along the shoreline of the study area increased by nearly
   171\%. Therefore, monitoring of the shorelines sedimentation and the
   wetland habitats using temporal remote sensing data are decision-making
   priorities to conserve the natural resources within similar arid
   environments.}},

Title = {{The impact of intense rainfall on insurance losses in two Swedish cities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{While a major part of previous research in the field of flood damage has
   focused on water depth as the most important causal factor, little
   attention has been paid to the role of rainfall intensity. As a test,
   this paper used correlation and regression analyses to investigate
   rainfall intensity as a factor affecting flood damage. For a time period
   of 15 years, the relationship between insurance losses caused by floods
   and rainfall intensity data from rain gauges was examined in two Swedish
   cities. Another objective was to find an approach for damage functions
   based on rainfall intensity as explanatory variable. Using linear
   regression, two approaches with considerable high degrees of explanation
   were found-one based on an exponential function and one on a power
   function. Using a lower limit for rainfall intensity, the approaches
   reached degrees of explanation between 30 and 78\%. From this study it
   was concluded that rainfall intensity during the summer months and the
   occurrence of insurance damages per day caused by floods were correlated
   and further that rainfall intensity has a great potential to explain
   urban flood damages. In the future, additional studies are needed to
   validate the proposed methods and integrate other flood damage affecting
   factors in the approach.}},

Abstract = {{The increase in floods and flash floods over the last decades has
   motivated researchers to develop improved methodologies for flood risk
   prevention and warning. Flood forecasting models available today have
   evolved technologically but are subject to limitations due to the lack
   of data and limited community participation. This paper presents the
   Hydrological Alert Model with Participatory Basis (HAMPB) model, an
   approach for integrating water level data reported by citizens, which
   has the advantage of being inexpensive and potentially highly available,
   with traditional data to improve flood forecasting. The model
   assimilates spatiotemporal water levels measured in the field when they
   are available through a real-time estimator. We added random
   perturbations of up to |10| and |15| cm to those data using the Monte
   Carlo Method to mimic the uncertainty in citizen science data
   collection. Applying the HAMPB model for urban nested-scale catchments
   (0.11 km(2) <= Area <= 21.84 km(2)) in Brazil shows: (a) significant
   improvements in flood simulations when field data was assimilated even
   considering the volunteered data uncertainty; (b) capability to update
   simulations in more than one point in the semi-distributed hydrological
   model by a regionalization method; and (c) flood hazard indexes and
   their uncertainties show better estimations using field data for
   updating.}},

Title = {{Resilience of coastal agricultural systems in Bangladesh: Assessment for
   agroecosystem stewardship strategies}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{106}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Assessments of ``resilience{''} are becoming a priority across multiple
   sectors. Specifically, the coastal agricultural system in Bangladesh
   faces a multitude of problems such as sea level rise. Building
   resilience for this system is thus important in accelerating the
   country's socio-economic development. Therefore, the objectives of this
   study are (a) to assess resilience of coastal agricultural systems and
   (b) to develop coastal agroecosystem stewardship strategies in
   Bangladesh. Resilience was assessed quantitatively, based on an
   established framework that includes three capacities (i.e., absorptive,
   adaptive and transformative) and five dimensions, namely, social,
   economic, ecological, physical and institutional. Fifteen indicators
   were developed by applying an assemblage of top-down and bottom-up
   approaches. A structured questionnaire was used to survey 330 households
   from 15 villages in five coastal sub-districts. The percentile value of
   composite resilience indices revealed that one-fifths of the coastal
   farmers (or households) had a mixed ability (e.g., fish farming skills)
   and capacity (e.g., better decision-making) to recover, reorganise and
   evolve following shocks (e.g., flash flood) and stresses (e.g., water
   logging). Following resilience assessment, five coastal agroecosystem
   stewardship strategies (facilitating adaptive agricultural governance;
   promoting economic and ecological diversity; fostering social learning;
   investing in coastal infrastructure; and increasing agricultural
   productivity) are developed based on principal component analysis. The
   methods of objectively developing stewardship strategies can be
   replicable to other coastal areas. The findings of this study are
   intended to be used for contributing to coastal adaptation planning in
   Bangladesh, especially for the Delta Plan 2100.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},

Abstract = {{The Spanish Mediterranean river basin provides a good background for
   studying floods from documentary and bibliographical sources within the
   specialty of historical climatology. This study region's long history of
   human occupation and climatic conditions together determine a high risk
   of flooding. As a result, there exists an enormous amount of documentary
   heritage containing flood information. However, the heterogeneity of
   documentary sources and different approaches to classifying floods
   through historical documents can generate some biases and uncertainties
   about the quantity and quality of the available data.
   For this reason, this paper proposes a methodology for reconstructing
   historical floods based on cross-referencing documentary sources. This
   approach, together with additional archival work, has allowed us to
   increase the number of flood series for the Spanish Mediterranean coast
   by 17\% and has generated a surprising increase of 233\% in the number
   of flood cases detected.
   The data obtained have allowed us to analyze the variability of floods
   and their relationship with climatic and social factors from the
   fourteenth century to the present. Different climatic oscillations
   related to the Little Ice Age are detected between the 14th and 19th
   centuries. Additionally, we detected a strong influence of the defense
   infrastructures and urban growth, which explain the recent flood trends.
   However, the difficulty in analyzing the influence of social factors on
   long-term flood behavior invites us to reflect on the need for further
   work for emphasizing these issues.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are one of the deadliest weather-related natural disasters in the
   continental United States (CONUS). Given that rainfall intensity and the
   amount of CONUS population exposed to floods is expected to increase in
   the future, it is critical to understand flood characteristics across
   the CONUS. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a
   flood-producing storm climatology over the CONUS from 2002 to 2013 to
   better understand rainfall characteristics of these storms and
   spatiotemporal differences across the country. Flood reports from the
   NCEI Storm Events Database are grouped by causative meteorological event
   and are merged with a database of stream-gauge-indicated floods to
   provide a robust indication of significant hydrologic events with a
   meteorological linkage. High-resolution Stage IV rainfall data were
   matched to 5559 flood episodes across the CONUS to identify rainfall
   characteristics of flood-producing storms in a variety of environments.
   This storm climatology indicates that flash flood-producing storms
   frequently occur with high rainfall accumulations in the summer east of
   the Rockies. Slow-rise flood-producing storms frequently occur in the
   spring-early summer (winter), with high rainfall accumulations over the
   northern and central CONUS (Pacific Northwest) due to rain-on-snowmelt,
   synoptic systems, and mesoscale convective systems (atmospheric rivers).
   Hybrid flood-producing storms, sharing characteristics of flash and
   slow-rise floods, frequently occur in spring-summer and have high
   rainfall accumulations in the central CONUS, Northeast, and
   mid-Atlantic. Results from this climatology may provide useful for
   emergency managers, city planners, and policy makers seeking efforts to
   protect their communities against risks associated with flood-producing
   storms.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Decision making and hydrologic design for coping with floods are complex
   tasks in poorly gauged high-relief basins. The response of such basins
   is driven by precipitation and temperature, which controls the freezing
   level elevation and size of the runoff-contributing area. Moreover,
   early warning of floods based solely on real-time in situ monitoring is
   impractical. This study presents a meteorological characterization of
   daily flows based on off-site daily precipitation and temperature data
   in a high-relief catchment in central Chile. The results show that the
   variables that best explain daily discharges are the cumulative
   precipitation over the previous 3 days measured at a high elevation and
   the minimum temperature on the day of the maximum discharge measured at
   a lower elevation in the valley. These variables were used to build
   three multivariate regression models, based on principal component
   analysis, which are able to predict the occurrence of daily flows,
   particularly for low exceedance probabilities. Although developed for a
   particular catchment, and despite the specific meteorological threshold
   magnitudes identified for the catchment, the analysis is easily

Abstract = {{Lampung is currently vulnerable to flooding. There were 16 flood events
   in Lampung with the latest major flood, which occurred in February 2018,
   inundated 10 sub-districts. One of the main causes of flooding in
   Lampung is flash flooding caused by heavy rainfall on the upstream area.
   The villages along Way Seputih (Seputih River), one of the main rivers
   in Lampung, Indonesia, have been affected by flash flood for the last
   three years. One of the possible solutions to control the flood from
   causing heavy causalities is to create a flood route model of Way
   Seputih, which is the main focus of this study. In this study, a
   hydraulic model of Way Seputih is built by using HEC-RAS 4.1 software to
   simulate the effect of extreme rainfall and how it causes flooding along
   the Way Seputih. The hydraulic model is based on field topographic
   measurement, simulated tides, and synthetic hydrographs generated by
   rainfall data and validated by field water surface elevation
   measurement. The output of HEC-RAS 4.1 in form of water surface
   elevation time series of locations along the Way Seputih is then used to
   build a flood route model. By using this model, the flooding time
   interval between villages along the Way Seputih can be predicted which
   can be used as the basis for an early warning system or planning for
   flood defense infrastructures such as dikes and pump systems.}},

Title = {{Fasting in the ureotelic Lake Magadi tilapia, Alcolapia grahami, does
   not reduce its high metabolic demand, increasing its vulnerability to
   siltation events}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Lake Magadi, Kenya, is one of the most extreme aquatic environments on
   Earth (pH similar to 10, anoxic to hyperoxic, high temperatures).
   Recently, increased water demand and siltation have threatened the
   viable hot springs near the margins of the lake where Alcolapia grahami,
   the only fish surviving in the lake, live. These Lake Magadi tilapia
   largely depend on nitrogen-rich cyanobacteria for food and are 100\%
   ureotelic. Their exceptionally high aerobic metabolic rate, together
   with their emaciated appearance, suggests that they are energy-limited.
   Therefore, we hypothesized that during food deprivation, Magadi tilapia
   would economize their energy expenditure and reduce metabolic rate,
   aerobic performance and urea-N excretion. Surprisingly, during a 5-day
   fasting period, routine metabolic rates increased and swimming
   performance (critical swimming speed) was not affected. Urea-N excretion
   remained stable despite the lack of their N-rich food source. Their
   nitrogen use switched to endogenous sources as liver and muscle protein
   levels decreased after a 5-day fast, indicating proteolysis.
   Additionally, fish relied on carbohydrates with lowered muscle glycogen
   levels, but there were no signs indicating use of lipid stores. Gene
   expression of gill and gut urea transporters were transiently reduced as
   were gill rhesus glycoprotein Rhbg and Rhcg-2. The reduction in gill
   glutamine synthetase expression concomitant with the reduction in Rh
   glycoprotein gene expression indicates reduced nitrogen/ammonia
   metabolism, most likely decreased protein synthesis. Additionally, fish
   showed reduced plasma total CO2, osmolality and Na+ (but not Cl-)
   levels, possibly related to reduced drinking rates and metabolic
   acidosis. Our work shows that Lake Magadi tilapia have the capacity to
   survive short periods of starvation which could occur when siltation
   linked to flash floods covers their main food source, but their
   seemingly hardwired high metabolic rates would compromise long-term
   survival.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation is an important meteorological variable which is critical
   for weather risk assessment. For instance, intense but short
   precipitation events can lead to flash floods and landslides. Most
   statistical modelling studies assume that the occurrence of
   precipitation events is based on a Poisson process with exponentially
   distributed waiting times while precipitation intensities are typically
   described by a gamma distribution or a mixture of two exponential
   distributions. Here, we show by using hourly precipitation data over the
   United Sates that the waiting time between precipitation events is
   non-exponentially distributed and best described by a fractional Poisson
   process. A systematic model selection procedure reveals that the hourly
   precipitation intensities are best represented by a two-distribution
   model for about 90\% of all stations. The two-distribution model
   consists of (a) a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) model for bulk
   precipitation event sizes and (b) a power-law distribution for large and
   extreme events. Finally, we analyse regional climate model output to
   evaluate how the climate models represent the high-frequency temporal
   structure of U.S. precipitation. Our results reveal that these regional
   climate models fail to accurately reproduce the power-law behaviour of
   intensities and severely underestimate the long durations between
   events.}},

Abstract = {{Floods have strong impacts in the Mediterranean region and there are
   concerns about a possible increase in their intensity due to climate
   change. In this study, a large database of 171 basins located in
   southern France with daily discharge data with a median record length of
   45 years is considered to analyze flood trends and their drivers. In
   addition to discharge data, outputs of precipitation, temperature,
   evapotranspiration from the SAFRAN reanalysis and soil moisture computed
   with the ISBA land surface model are also analyzed. The evolution of
   land cover in these basins is analyzed using the CORINE database. The
   trends in floods above the 95th and 99th percentiles are detected by the
   Mann-Kendall test and quantile regression techniques. The results show
   that despite the increase in extreme precipitation reported by previous
   studies, there is no general tendency towards more severe floods. Only
   for a few basins is the intensity of the most extreme floods showing
   significant upward trends. On the contrary, most trends are towards
   fewer annual flood occurrences above both the 95th and 99th percentiles
   for the majority of basins. The decrease in soil moisture seems to be an
   important driver for these trends, since in most basins increased
   temperature and evapotranspiration associated with a precipitation
   decrease are leading to a reduction in soil moisture. These results
   imply that the observed increase in the vulnerability to these flood
   events in recent decades is mostly caused by human factors such as
   increased urbanization and population growth rather than climatic
   factors.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Flash flood is disastrous; it losses property and life. Its effect is
   intensified while it occurs in semiarid region because of less
   preparedness. The present case conferred about a flash flood in semiarid
   region in Gujarat which was affected by flood in 2015 and 2017. Massive
   loss of lives and properties has been observed after the event. Now,
   recuperating the region against flood losses, it was a prime requirement
   to distribute the flood relief packages to the flood-susceptible areas.
   To identify the flood hazards and flood risk and assess the flood
   vulnerability in Rel River catchment, the region is divided into 52
   micro-watersheds using RS and GIS techniques. The morphology of the Rel
   River catchments has been explored using the morphometric analysis. The
   priority rank and category for each micro-watershed were assigned based
   on compound factor values, whereas compound factor was calculated using
   weighted sum analysis techniques. Flood hazard zone map was prepared,
   and flood vulnerability has been characterized from very low to very
   high. Furthermore, the multi-criteria analysis was used to calculate the
   risk factor for the basin and AHP-MCE method was used to find the
   normalized weights of each factor (LU/LC, CF, soil, slope, drainage
   density) that were significant to the flood disaster. The integration of
   flood hazard map along with these parameters helped to understand the
   sensitivity of flash floods at different locations within the study
   area. Flood risk map was further analyzed at village level, and it has
   been identified that 17 out of 39 villages were at high risk, 12
   villages were at moderate risk and 10 villages were at low risk. The
   study helped to clearly identify villages vulnerable to flood risk where
   more relief and flood insurance packages need to be allotted. Thus, the
   present method and integrated approach would be a useful tool for the
   decision maker to distribute the flood relief package in flash
   flood-prone area.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an integrated approach to evaluate inundation risks,
   in which an algorithm is proposed to integrate the storm water
   management model (SWMM) into a geographical information system (GIS).
   The proposed algorithm simulates the flood inundation of overland flows
   and in metro stations for each designed scenario. It involves the
   following stages: (i) determination of the grid location and spreading
   coefficient and (ii) an iterative calculation of the spreading process.
   In addition, an equation is proposed to calculate the inundation around
   a metro station and to predict the potential inundation risks of the
   metro system. The proposed method is applied to simulate the inundation
   risk of the metro system in the urban centre of Shanghai under 50-year,
   100-year, and 500-year rainfall intensities. Both inundation extent and
   depth are obtained and the proposed method is validated with records of
   historical floods. The results demonstrate that in the case of a
   500-year rainfall intensity, the inundated area with a water depth
   excess of 300 mm covers up to 5.16 km(2). In addition, four metro
   stations are inundated to a depth of over 300 mm.}},

Title = {{Feasibility of rainwater harvesting for sustainable water management in
   urban areas of Egypt}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Egypt's limited water resources, rapid population growth, and climate
   change are increasing the gap between water demand and supply.
   Meanwhile, significant amounts of rain fall in some regions in Egypt
   during specific storm events, which in some cases, lead to disasters
   like flash floods and inundations. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) can be
   considered as a sustainable promising solution to water shortage and
   inundation problems. In this work, the feasibility of RWH for urban
   areas was assessed over 22 cities throughout Egypt. Results show that
   the annual volume of rainwater harvested can reach 142.5 MCM in the
   considered cities, provided that all rain falling on the urban areas is
   collected. High potential of rainfall harvesting was found for cities
   that located on the North Coast, e.g., the potential water saving from
   the share of RWH in Alexandria can satisfy around 12\% of its future
   supplementary domestic water needs. In contrast, rainfall over the
   cities located on the middle and the south of the country is
   insignificant to be harvested. A case study for the 5th settlement
   region in Cairo was discussed in terms of groundwater recharge and
   surface runoff estimation for two conditions: No-RWH and RWH systems by
   implementing recharge wells to store rainwater into the aquifer. Land
   cover classification maps of urban areas were created by using the
   ARCGIS software to estimate equivalent infiltration coefficients. The
   results demonstrate that the implementation of such RWH system has a
   significant impact on the regional water cycle, where the effective
   infiltration coefficient increased from 10\% (No-RWH) to 75\% (RWH) in
   the case study. Accordingly, the runoff coefficient decreased in the
   case study from 0.8 (No-RWH) to 0.15 (RWH), and the volume of runoff
   decreased in the case of RWH by around 82\% lower than that of the
   No-RWH condition. Thus, direct infiltration of RWH into an aquifer can
   play an important role in sound water management for urban environments,
   as this may lead to a significant reduction in risks of flooding and
   expenses of municipal drainage systems installation and operation.}},

Title = {{Vulnerability indicators for natural hazards: an innovative selection
   and weighting approach}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{To prepare for upcoming extreme events, decision makers, scientists and
   other stakeholders require a thorough understanding of the vulnerability
   of the built environment to natural hazards. A vulnerability index based
   on building characteristics (indicators) rather than empirical data may
   be an alternative approach to a comprehensive physical vulnerability
   assessment of the building stock. The present paper focuses on the
   making of such an index for dynamic flooding in mountain areas
   demonstrating the transferability of vulnerability assessment approaches
   between hazard types, reducing the amount of required data and offering
   a tool that can be used in areas were empirical data are not available.
   We use data from systematically documented torrential events in the
   European Alps to select and weight the important indicators using an
   all-relevant feature selection algorithm based on random forests. The
   permutation-based feature selection reduced the initial number of
   indicators from 22 to seven, decreasing in this way the amount of
   required data for assessing physical vulnerability and ensuring that
   only relevant indicators are considered. The new Physical Vulnerability
   Index (PVI) may be used in the mountain areas of Europe and beyond where
   only few empirical data are available supporting decision-making in
   reducing risk to dynamic flooding.}},

Title = {{Sources and transformations of iron in the sediments of the Gulf of
   Aqaba (Red Sea)}},
Journal = {{MARINE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{216}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{The Gulf of Aqaba is an oligotrophic marine system with an oxygen-rich
   water column. Aeolian dust from the Arabian, Sinai, and Sahara deserts
   is an important source of sedimentary material to the gulf, especially
   at 700 m water depth. The head of the gulf is affected by sediment
   transport from the Arava desert during winter flash floods. In this
   work, we have studied the speciation of iron in the dust, dry creek
   sediments and sediments of the Gulf of Aqaba at various water depths in
   order to understand sources and transformations of iron. Two sources of
   iron, dust and flash floods transported material, were found to possess
   distinct geochemical signatures: dust was found to be enriched in total
   and highly reactive iron relative to the sediments in creek beds.
   Combination of these two sources leads to an increase of highly reactive
   iron in sediments with water depth. This increase, in turn, results in
   formation of a lateral redox gradient with sulfidic pore-waters near the
   shore, and ferruginous-manganous pore-waters and cryptic sulfur cycling
   at the deeper water sites. Another result of dry aeolian deposition of
   desert dust to the sediments of the Gulf of Aqaba, overlaid by deep
   well-oxygenated waters, is anomalously high ratios of highly reactive to
   total iron, which have been proposed to be diagnostic for anoxic,
   iron-rich water columns, when applied as a paleoproxy.}},

Title = {{Poverty and environmental nexus in rural Pakistan: a multidimensional
   approach}},
Journal = {{GEOJOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{The study examines the relationship between poverty and forest cover
   degradation in rural areas of Pakistan. The area selected for the study
   District Upper Dir is a rural and relatively backward region located in
   northwestern Pakistan, in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The study area is
   undergoing severe deforestation and natural disasters in the recent
   past. The study consists of two stages, in first stage the traditional
   Geographical information system image was used to analyze the
   spatial-temporal situation of the surroundings. In the second stage,
   well-designed questionnaire was used to collect the primary information
   from 420 randomly selected households of research areas. A
   multidimensional poverty index has been used to measure the poverty
   profile of the population. It has been found that 55\% households were
   below the poverty line. Almost, 95\% households are using wood for
   cooking purposes. High dependence on natural resources causes forest
   cover degradation while burning off too much wood causes CO2 emission
   and leads to environmental degradation. A major portion of population is
   living on steeply sloped areas with certain risks. It is found that
   frequency of flash flood is 53\% and agricultural land (54\%) is at high
   risk and often flows with flash floods. It is concluded that there is
   strong correlation between multidimensional poverty and forest cover
   degradation which leads to climate and environmental risks.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding city residents' collective geotagged behaviors (CGTBs) in
   response to hazards and emergency events is important in disaster
   mitigation and emergency response. It is a challenge, if not impossible,
   to directly observe CGTBs during a real-time matter. This study used the
   number of location requests (NLR) data generated by smartphone users for
   a variety of purposes such as map navigation, car hailing, and food
   delivery to infer the dynamics of CGTBs in response to rainstorms in
   eight Chinese cities. We examined rainstorms, flooding, and NLR
   anomalies, as well as the associations among them, in eight selected
   cities across mainland China. The time series NLR clearly reflects
   cities' general diurnal rhythm, and the total NLR is moderately
   correlated with the total city population. Anomalies of the NLR were
   identified at both the city and grid scale using the Seasonal Hybrid
   Extreme Studentized Deviate (S-H-ESD) method. Analysis results
   demonstrated that the NLR anomalies at the city and grid levels are well
   associated with rainstorms, indicating that city residents request more
   location-based services (e.g., map navigation, car hailing, food
   delivery, etc.) when there is a rainstorm. However, the sensitivity of
   the city residents' collective geotagged behaviors in response to
   rainstorms varies in different cities as shown by different peak
   rainfall intensity thresholds. Significant high peak rainfall intensity
   tends to trigger city flooding, which leads to increased location-based
   requests as shown by positive anomalies in the time series NLR.}},

Title = {{Multidisciplinary analysis of combined flow-like mass movements in a
   catchment of Southern Italy}},
Journal = {{GEORISK-ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK FOR ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND
   GEOHAZARDS}},
Abstract = {{Rainfall can trigger flow-like mass movements characterised by different
   percentages of solid and water (debris flows, hyperconcentrated flows,
   and flash floods). They exhibit different magnitude (volume), run-out
   distance and consequence, due to both distinct triggering mechanisms and
   kinematic features. Indeed, discriminating among these phenomena for
   appropriate risk analysis and zoning is a relevant issue also
   considering that the volume of the flow may sudden increase along the
   propagation path. The paper deals with September 2010 combined types of
   flows occurred at Atrani village (Amalfi coast, southern Italy), and
   originated by heavy rainstorm in the catchment located upslope to the
   urban centre. The events were reconstructed by using multi-source
   information. Field surveys, geological analysis, elaboration of videos
   recorded during the events and numerical modelling were combined. A 40
   minutes lasting water flood abruptly combined to a relatively
   small-sized high-discharge hyperconcentrated flow, with the consequence
   of an abnormal flow that invaded the narrow main street of the urban
   area in few minutes. The peak discharge at the catchment outlet was
   increased by erosion and/or other rainfall-induced slope instabilities
   occurred in the whole catchment. As main conclusion, the
   multidisciplinary analysis has resulted effective to enhance the
   understanding of the complex flow-like mass movements.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate real-time forecasts of river stages can serve as a reference
   for flood evacuation to minimize losses and casualties. Machine learning
   has been widely used for river stage forecasting because of its simple
   modeling and quick computation. However, many machine learning models
   have drawbacks such as excessive learning time, difficult evaluation of
   input variables, and lack of explanatory capacity, which limit their
   performance as practical tools. To overcome these drawbacks, this study
   employs multiple additive regression trees (MART) for river stage
   forecasting. Three MART models are proposed, namely the original MART
   model, the real-time MART model, and the naive MART model, with
   different considerations of model training and error correction. Model
   training and testing were conducted based on the rainfall and river
   stage data for 16 typhoon events between 2005 and 2009 in the Bazhang
   River Basin in Taiwan. In the training process, variables are
   automatically selected by the MART models which reasonably describes the
   mechanism of flood transportation. The testing results show that all
   three models can reasonably forecast the river stages with a three-hour
   lead-time. Compared with the original MART, the real-time MART performs
   better in describing overall river stage variations, whereas the naive
   MART is more accurate in the prediction of peak river stages. The
   proposed MART models are efficient and accurate and can thus serve as
   practical tools for flash flood early warning.}},

   management challenges of stormwater in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Study region: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Study focus: Addis Ababa is undergoing rapid urbanization with
   unprecedented high rate of road and building constructions, resulting in
   a sudden upsurge of sealed surfaces and generation of significant
   amounts of stormwater. The present study therefore aims to investigate
   the hydraulic capacity of existing drains and stormwater management
   challenges using detailed field surveys, and stakeholders' interview.
   469 road segments (74 km) and 202 drain segments (42.76 km) in two
   representative case sites confined in 564.54 ha boundary areas were
   physically surveyed.
   New hydrological insights for the region: Results showed that 14\% of
   the drains in new city parts and 28\% in old city parts were in
   conditions inadequate for removal of stormwater, resulting in flash
   flooding and infrastructure degradation in the associated watersheds.
   Further, although more than 72\% of the surveyed drains were oversized,
   stormwater overtopping reoccur as a season-to-season problem, ascribed
   to illegal dumping of waste into drains, reducing their hydraulic
   capacity. The challenges of stormwater management were related to lack
   of city-wide drainage master plan, absence of hydrologic data
   considerations during designing drains, and weak enforcement on solid
   and liquid waste dumping into drains. The present study recommends that
   building practices that minimize surface sealing and critical hydrologic
   and hydraulic considerations during designing drains, and educating the
   local community and stakeholders regarding waste management.}},

   and Meteorological Events in the Czech Republic}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the potential of documentary evidence for enhancing
   the study of fatalities taking place in the course of hydrological and
   meteorological events (HMEs). Chronicles, ``books of memory{''}, weather
   diaries, newspapers (media), parliamentary proposals, epigraphic
   evidence, systematic meteorological/hydrological observations, and
   professional papers provide a broad base for gathering such information
   in the Czech Republic, especially since 1901. The spatiotemporal
   variability of 269 fatalities in the Czech Republic arising out of 103
   HMEs (flood, flash flood, windstorm, convective storm, lightning, frost,
   snow/glaze-ice calamity, heat, and other events) in the 1981-2018 period
   is presented, with particular attention to closer characterisation of
   fatalities (gender, age, cause of death, place, type of death, and
   behaviour). Examples of three outstanding events with the highest
   numbers of fatalities (severe frosts in the extremely cold winter of
   1928/1929, a flash flood on 9 June 1970, and a rain flood in July 1997)
   are described in detail. Discussion of results includes the problem of
   data uncertainty, factors influencing the numbers of fatalities, and the
   broader context. Since floods are responsible for the highest proportion
   of HME-related deaths, places with fatalities are located mainly around
   rivers and drowning appears as the main cause of death. In the further
   classification of fatalities, males and adults clearly prevail, while
   indirect victims and hazardous behaviour are strongly represented.}},

Title = {{An Operational Forecasting System for Flash Floods in Mountainous Areas
   in Taiwan}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods are different from common floods because they occur rapidly
   over short time scales, and they are considered to be one of the most
   devastating natural hazards worldwide. Mountainous areas with high
   population densities are particularly threatened by flash floods because
   steep slopes generate high flow velocities. Therefore, there is a great
   need to develop an operational forecasting system (OFS) for better flash
   flood prediction and warning in mountainous regions. This study
   developed an OFS through the integration of meteorological,
   hydrological, and hydrodynamic models. Airborne light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) data were used to generate a digital elevation model
   (DEM). The OFS employs high-density and high-accuracy airborne LiDAR DEM
   data to simulate rapid water level rises and flooding as the result of
   intense rainfall within relatively small watersheds. The water levels
   and flood extent derived from the OFS are in agreement with the measured
   and surveyed data. The OFS has been adopted by the National Science and
   Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) for forecasting flash
   floods every six hours in a mountainous floodplain in Taiwan. The 1D and
   2D visualization of the OFS is performed via the National Center for
   Atmospheric Research Command Language (NCL).}},

Title = {{Simulation of Hydraulic Structures in 2D High-Resolution Urban Flood
   Modeling}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Urban flooding as a result of inadequate drainage capacity, failure of
   flood defenses, etc. is usually featured with highly transient
   hydrodynamics. Reliable and efficient prediction and forecasting of
   these urban flash floods is still a great technical challenge.
   Meanwhile, in urban environments, the flooding hydrodynamics and process
   may be influenced by flow regulation and flood protection hydraulic
   infrastructure systems, such as sluice gates, which should be
   effectively taken into account in an urban flood model. However, direct
   simulation of hydraulic structures is not a current practice in 2D urban
   flood modeling. This work aims to develop a robust numerical approach to
   directly simulate the effects of gate structures in a 2D high-resolution
   urban flood model. A new modeling component is developed and fully
   coupled to a finite volume Godunov-type shock-capturing shallow water
   model, to directly simulate the highly transient flood waves through
   hydraulic structures. Different coupling approaches, i.e., flux term
   coupling and source term coupling, are implemented and compared. A
   numerical experiment conducted for an analytical dam-break test
   indicates that the flux term coupling approach may lead to more accurate
   results, with the calculated RMSE against water level 28\%-38\% less
   than that produced by the source term coupling approach. The flux term
   coupling approach is therefore adopted to improve the current urban
   flood model, and it is further tested by reproducing the laboratory
   experiments of flood routing in a flume with partially open sluice
   gates, conducted in the hydraulic laboratory at the Zhejiang Institute
   of Hydraulics and Estuary, China. The numerical results are compared
   favorably with experimental measurements, with a maximum RMSE of 0.0851
   for all the individual tests. The satisfactory results demonstrate that
   the flood model implemented with the flux coupling approach is able to
   accurately simulate the flow through hydraulic structures, with enhanced
   predictive capability for urban flood modeling.}},

Title = {{Development of Nomogram for Debris Flow Forecasting Based on Critical
   Accumulated Rainfall in South Korea}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Climate change causes extreme weather events worldwide such as
   increasing temperatures and changing rainfall patterns. With South Korea
   facing growing damage from the increased frequency of localized heavy
   rains. In particular, its steep slope lands, including mountainous
   areas, are vulnerable to damage from landslides and debris flows. In
   addition, localized short-term heavy rains that occur in urban areas
   with extremely high intensity tend to lead a sharp increase in damage
   from soil-related disasters and cause huge losses of life and property.
   Currently, South Korea forecasts landslides and debris flows using the
   standards for forecasting landslides and heavy rains. However, as the
   forecasting is conducted separately for rainfall intensity and
   accumulated rainfall, this lacks a technique that reflects both amount
   and intensity of rainfall in an episode of localized heavy rainfall. In
   this study, aims to develop such a technique by collecting past cases of
   debris flow occurrences and rainfall events that accompanied debris
   flows to calculate the rainfall triggering index (RTI) reflecting
   accumulated rainfall and rainfall intensity. In addition, the RTI is
   converted into the critical accumulated rainfall (R-c) to use rainfall
   information and provide real-time forecasting. The study classifies the
   standards for flow debris forecasting into three levels: ALERT
   (10-50\%), WARNING (50-70\%), and EMERGENCY (70\% or higher), to provide
   a nomogram for 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h. As a result of applying this
   classification into the actual cases of Seoul, Chuncheon, and Cheongju,
   it is found that about 2-4 h of response time is secured from the point
   of the Emergency level to the occurrence of debris flows.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of identifying the areas vulnerable for both floods and
   flash-floods is an important component of risk management. The
   assessment of vulnerable areas is a major challenge in the scientific
   world. The aim of this study is to provide a methodology-oriented study
   of how to identify the areas vulnerable to floods and flash-floods in
   the Buzu river catchment by computing two indices: the Flash-Flood
   Potential Index (FFPI) for the mountainous and the Sub-Carpathian areas,
   and the Flood Potential Index (FPI) for the low-altitude areas, using
   the frequency ratio (FR), a bivariate statistical model, the Multilayer
   Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP), and the ensemble model MLP-FR. A
   database containing historical flood locations (168 flood locations) and
   the areas with torrentiality (172 locations with torrentiality) was
   created and used to train and test the models. The resulting models were
   computed using GIS techniques, thus resulting the flood and flash-flood
   vulnerability maps. The results show that the MLP-FR hybrid model had
   the most performance. The use of the two indices represents a
   preliminary step in creating flood vulnerability maps, which could
   represent an important tool for local authorities and a support for
   flood risk management policies.}},

Title = {{Mapping Flood-Related Mortality in the Mediterranean Basin. Results from
   the MEFF v2.0 DB}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recent events in Western Attica in Greece (24 deaths in November 2017),
   in the Balearic Islands (13 deaths in October 2018), and in southern
   France (15 deaths in October 2018) show that flood-related mortality
   remains a major concern in Mediterranean countries facing flash floods.
   Over the past several years, many initiatives have arisen to create
   databases on flood-related mortality. An international initiative
   started in 2011 pooling regional and national databases on flood
   mortality from region and/or countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.
   The MEditerranean Flood Fatality Database (MEFF DB) brings together, in
   2018, six Mediterranean regions/countries: Catalonia (Spain), Balearic
   Islands (Spain), Southern France, Calabria (Italy), Greece, and Turkey,
   and covers the period 1980-2018. MEFF DB is on progress and, every year,
   new data are included, but for this study, we kept only the preliminary
   data that were geolocated and validated on 31st of December 2018. This
   research introduces a new step in the analysis of flood-related
   mortality and follows the statistical description of the MEFF DB already
   published. The goals of this paper are to draw the spatial distribution
   of flood mortality through a geographical information system (GIS) at
   different spatial scales: country, NUTS 3 (Nomenclature of Territorial
   Units for Statistics. Level 3) regions, catchment areas, and grid. A
   fatality rate (F: number of deaths/year/million of inhabitants) is
   created to help this analysis. Then, we try to relate mortality to basic
   (human or physical) drivers such as population density, rainfall
   seasonality, or rainfall frequency across the Mediterranean Basin. The
   mapping of F shows a negative mortality gradient between the western and
   the eastern parts of the Mediterranean Sea. The south of France appears
   to be the most affected region. The maps also highlight the seasonality
   of flood-related deaths with the same west-east gradient. It confirms
   that flood mortality follows the climatological seasonal patterns across
   the Mediterranean Basin. Flood-related fatalities mainly occur during
   the early fall season in the western part of the Mediterranean area,
   while the Easter Basin is affected later, in November or during the
   winter season. Eastern Turkey introduces another pattern, as mortality
   is more severe in summer. Mortality maps are then compared with factors
   that potentially contribute to the occurrence of flood fatalities, such
   as precipitation intensity (rainfall hazard), to explain geographical
   differences in the fatality rate. The density of a fatal event is
   correlated to the population density and the rainfall frequency.
   Conversely, the average number of deaths per event depends on other
   factors such as prevention or crisis management.}},

Abstract = {{Fluvial morphometry aid in the interpretation of morphodynamic and
   hydrological behavior in watersheds. The determination of the scale of
   work is important since a change in it generates a variation in the
   results and modifies the applicability of the indexes. But does this
   variation occur in all the indexes? The objective of this work is to
   study fluvial morphometry and compare morphometric indices at different
   spatial scales in the San Bernardo river basin. It is located in the
   center-south of the Sistema de Ventania, Buenos Aires (Argentina). It
   has an area of 82 km(2), it does not have capacity and it generates
   torrential floods before the occurrence of intense precipitation events
   (100 mm / 24 h). The results obtained were compared at a scale of 1:
   50.000 (official cartographic scale of greater detail in Argentina) and
   1: 1.400 (scale closest to the reality of the basin obtained from Google
   Earth). The parameters of area (A), perimeter (P), channel length (lc),
   height (h), slope (D), slope and the indices were calculated: Ratio of
   elongation (Re), Reason of relief (Rr), Relief ratio (R), Bifurcation
   ratio (Rb), Length ratio (Rl), Torrentiality coefficient (Ct), Drainage
   density (Dd) and Drainage frequency (Fd) relevant to the study of
   floods. The results of the Rb and Re indixesassociated with the topology
   and shape respectively reveal a basin with high potential to generate
   torrential floods. The values obtained for the Dd and Ct indices
   reinforce what has been said previously. In both, scales the indexes
   maintain in the rank of classifi cation, however, those of major scale
   approach the real situation. The use of more detail, as in this case,
   allows to improve the results in small basins and in indexes influenced
   by the properties of the drainage network.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of heavy rainfall in the south-eastern hilly region of
   Bangladesh makes this area highly susceptible to recurrent flash
   flooding. As the region is the commercial capital of Bangladesh, these
   flash floods pose a significant threat to the national economy.
   Predicting this type of flooding is a complex task which requires a
   detailed understanding of the river basin characteristics. This study
   evaluated the susceptibility of the region to flash floods emanating
   from within the Karnaphuli and Sangu river basins. Twenty-two
   morphometric parameters were used. The occurrence and impact of flash
   floods within these basins are mainly associated with the volume of
   runoff, runoff velocity, and the surface infiltration capacity of the
   various watersheds. Analysis showed that major parts of the basin were
   susceptible to flash flooding events of a `moderate'-to-'very high'
   level of severity. The degree of susceptibility of ten of the watersheds
   was rated as `high', and one was `very high'. The flash flood
   susceptibility map drawn from the analysis was used at the sub-district
   level to identify populated areas at risk. More than 80\% of the total
   area of the 16 sub-districts were determined to have a
   `high'-to-'very-high'-level flood susceptibility. The analysis noted
   that around 3.4 million people reside in flash flood-prone areas,
   therefore indicating the potential for loss of life and property. The
   study identified significant flash flood potential zones within a region
   of national importance, and exposure of the population to these events.
   Detailed analysis and display of flash flood susceptibility data at the
   sub-district level can enable the relevant organizations to improve
   watershed management practices and, as a consequence, alleviate future
   flood risk.}},

Abstract = {{Floods are some of the most destructive and catastrophic disasters
   worldwide. Development of management plans needs a deep understanding of
   the likelihood and magnitude of future flood events. The purpose of this
   research was to estimate flash flood susceptibility in the Tafresh
   watershed, Iran, using five machine learning methods, i.e., alternating
   decision tree (ADT), functional tree (FT), kernel logistic regression
   (KLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and quadratic discriminant analysis
   (QDA). A geospatial database including 320 historical flood events was
   constructed and eight geo-environmental variables-elevation, slope,
   slope aspect, distance from rivers, average annual rainfall, land use,
   soil type, and lithology-were used as flood influencing factors. Based
   on a variety of performance metrics, it is revealed that the ADT method
   was dominant over the other methods. The FT method was ranked as the
   second-best method, followed by the KLR, MLP, and QDA. Given a few
   differences between the goodness-of-fit and prediction success of the
   methods, we concluded that all these five machine-learning-based models
   are applicable for flood susceptibility mapping in other areas to
   protect societies from devastating floods.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of flooding, namely fluvial flood (FF) and pluvial flash flood
   (PFF), exist in tropical cities located close to permanent rivers, where
   extreme precipitation intensity occurs. Although several methods are
   available for assessment of FF, however, PFF has received minimal
   attention from the researchers. Studies rarely presented joint FF and
   PFF hazards. Therefore, the current study not only aims to evaluate
   probability and hazards for FF and PFF independently but also implements
   combined FF with PFF probabilistic inundation analysis. First, an
   integrated model was developed to analyze probability using fully
   distributed geographic information system (GIS)-based algorithms. These
   methods were performed on Damansara River Catchment in Kuala Lumpur,
   because yearly monsoon triggers FFs and simultaneously coincides with
   heavy local rainfalls. A hydraulic 2D high-resolution sub-grid model of
   Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System was performed to
   simulate FF probability and hazard. Nine significant contributing
   parameters were trained with PFF inventory by GIS-based random forest
   (RF) model and each RF parameter was optimized by particle swarm
   optimization algorithm (PSO) to model the PFF probabilistic hazard.
   Finally, PFF was combined with FF probabilities to discover the impact
   and contribution of each type of urban flood hazard. This study is the
   first attempt to model PFF hazard using GIS and physical-based PSO-RF
   model and combined FF and PFF probabilistic map. The results provide
   detailed flood information for urban managers to smartly equip
   infrastructures, such as highways, roads, and sewage network.}},

Abstract = {{Water consumption and the resulting sewage volume (both strongly
   impacted by meteorological parameters) are of key importance for an
   efficient and sustainable operation of waterworks and wastewater
   treatment plants. Therefore, the objective of this research is to
   analyze the potential impact of input variables uncertainty on the
   performance of sewage volume forecasting model. The research is based on
   a real, three-year long, daily time series collected from Torun
   (Poland). The used time series encompassed: sewage volume, water
   consumption, rainfall, temperature, precipitation, evaporation, sunshine
   duration and precipitation at a six hours interval. Neural network has
   been selected as a forecasting tool a multi-layer perceptron
   artificial., a simulation model for the sewage volume was created which
   considered the above-mentioned time series as exogenous variables.
   Further, its performance was tested assuming that all non-historical
   input variables are prone to their individual forecasting errors. The
   analysis was dedicated firstly to each variable individually and later
   the potential of all of them being uncertain was tested. A lack of
   correlation between the input variables error was assumed. The research
   provides an interesting solution for visualizing the quality and actual
   performance of forecasting models where some or all of input variables
   has to be forecast.}},

   The case of the Almanzora River}},

Abstract = {{The study of flood events, especially analyses of flood magnitude and
   flood frequency, is crucial for the planning and management of
   settlements and infrastructure located near river channels. This work
   studies the historical floods of the Almanzora catchment, in
   southeastern Spain, one of the driest regions in Europe. We compile,
   describe and statistically process flood data that extend back to the
   year 1500 CE. The data were collected from historical sources held in
   both local and regional archives. The analysis of the flood record shows
   that the most destructive events occurred in 1550, 1729, 1879 and 1973,
   the last of these being the most catastrophic event on record. The
   synoptic configurations of the four most destructive floods in the
   time-series were explored and found to present the same type of pattern
   (cold drop). Historical flood discharges were estimated by calibrating
   historical flood magnitudes with instrumental data. This assessment was
   undertaken using a cumulative function applied to flood episodes that
   exceeded the threshold of magnitudes >= 3. The flood frequency analysis
   performed by combining instrumental and historical data shows that
   catastrophic events, such as the 1973 flood with a discharge of 5600
   m(3) s(-1), occur with a return period of < 100 years. We also estimate
   that high magnitude floods with a discharge between 684 and 3081 m(3)
   s(-1) can occur every 10-50 years. During recent decades, several
   municipalities and, above all, the coastal area of the Almanzora
   catchment have experienced significant urban growth and land use
   changes, as a result of the development of both tourism and extensive
   agriculture. This, in turn, has contributed to an increase in flood
   exposure.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity of flood dynamics to different soil information sources in
   urbanized areas}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{577}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study focused on the sensitivity of flood dynamics to soil
   hydraulic properties derived from three different soil databases in
   urbanized area: (1) upscaled locally observed soil texture data based on
   the soil-landscape relationships (SMLS); (2) the SoilGrids250m open data
   source (SMSG); and (3) the FAO soil map (SMFAO). However, soil in the
   urban areas has two major conditions related to land cover and soil
   physical structure for which the information is not available in soil
   databases: the effect of fragmented vegetation cover and the effect of
   compaction of bare soil. Non-built-up areas can be covered by fragmented
   vegetation (grass and shrubs) which generally has high infiltration
   rates. In contrast, bare areas such as dirt roads and footpath can be
   heavily compacted and have typically low infiltration rates. We used
   Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) with satellite-derived vegetation cover
   and bare soil to predict soil hydraulic properties related to the
   uncompacted and compacted scenarios. Infiltration dynamics was derived
   from the predicted soil hydraulic properties for these soil information
   sources, which then determined the flood dynamics in the catchment. The
   flash flood modeling was done using the integrated flood modeling system
   using openLISEM (Bout and Jetten, 2018) for the whole of Kampala
   (Uganda) using the 25th of June 2012 flood event. In the distributed
   openLISEM hydrological model, these two urban soil conditions have been
   treated separately. We have evaluated the sensitivity of flood dynamics
   to three different soil databases under both uncompacted and compacted
   urban soil conditions by using different flood indicators such as
   catchment water balance, infiltration rate, flood depth and duration,
   flooded area and flood volume, and the average number of structures
   affected. The result of the study indicates that soil hydraulic
   properties needed for the distributed hydrological model are better
   predicted when using the SMSG and SMLS, which resulted in better
   infiltration simulation. Consequently, compared to an earlier simulation
   that was verified with stakeholders and accepted for drainage system
   design, the accuracy of the simulated flood extent map was better when
   using SMSG and SMLS. Moreover, soil compaction significantly reduces
   infiltration and consequently increases the flood depth and duration,
   and therefore, must be included in the urban flash flood modeling study.}},

Abstract = {{Many sources of data (remote sensing and meteorological data, soils and
   groundwater samples) were used to estimate the magnitude of geological
   hazards, which are confirmed with field and laboratory investigation in
   Najran area, Kingdom Saudi Arabia. Najran area is one of these
   locations. It is subjected to a range of geo-hazards due to its
   intrinsic physiographic and geologic nature. Najran area is a growing
   urban and agricultural development region; however, some infrastructures
   have been constructed in vulnerable locations to geo-environmental
   hazards. The potential geo-hazards that may occur under desert
   conditions include sand accumulations, dune movement, mass westing and
   rock fall hazards, flash floods, sand stroom and problematic soils. The
   current study throws more light on all these geo-hazards in Najran area.
   Also, remediation methods for geo-hazard should be proposed to avoid
   these natural hazards. The present study is a trail to calculate and
   evaluate the drainage basins properties and potentiality using remote
   sensing and (GIS) tools. Twenty morphometric parameters were measured,
   in order to identify and evaluate flash flood hazards. Flash flood
   hazards in the Wadi Najran watershed is classified into three groups
   based on their morphometric parameters results; namely, highly,
   moderately and low slightly hazard degree. Our findings indicate that
   Najran area needs more attention and care. The Saudi Government has to
   join together with other people to reduce the resulting geological
   hazards.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in past occurrences of flooding from
   intense rainfall, commonly referred to as ``flash flooding,{''} and the
   associated socioeconomic consequences. Historical information can help
   us to place recent events in context and to understand the effect of low
   frequency climate variability on changing flash flood frequencies.
   Previous studies have focussed on fluvial flooding to reconstruct the
   temporal and spatial patterns of past events. Here, we provide an online
   flood chronology for the north and south-west of England for flash
   floods, including both surface water and fluvial flooding, with coverage
   from similar to 1700 to similar to 2013 (). The primary source of
   documentary material is local newspaper reports, which often give
   detailed descriptions of impacts. This provides a new resource to inform
   communities and first responders of flood risks, especially those from
   rapid rise in water level whose severity may be greater than those of
   accompanying peak flow. Examples are provided of historical flash floods
   that exemplify how the chronologies can help to place recent floods in
   the context of the preinstrumental record for: (a) more robust estimates
   of event return period, (b) identification of catchment or settlement
   susceptibility to flash flood events, and (c) characterisation of events

Abstract = {{Hydrological modelling is a critical tool for preventing and mitigating
   severe flood disasters. This study aims to assess the applicability of a
   physically based distributed hydrological model, CASCade Two Dimensional
   SEDiment (CASC2D-SED), for flood forecasting in four typical medium and
   small watersheds across three hydroclimatic zones (semi-arid, semihumid,
   and humid) in China. CASC2D-SED model has the best performance in
   Xianbeigou (semi-arid), followed by Luanchuan (semihumid), and Shujia
   (humid), while has the relatively lowest performance in Chengcun
   (humid). It tends to underestimate a large portion of the discharges in
   the watersheds, indicating that the Green-Ampt infiltration-excess
   model, the only runoff generation scheme in CASC2D-SED model, imposes
   restrictions on hydrological simulation without further accounting for
   subsurface and groundwater flows. This limitation is particularly
   obvious in the semihumid and humid regions. Our analysis suggests that
   combining infiltration-excess and saturation-excess runoff generation
   mechanisms and accounting for subsurface and groundwater flows in
   CASC2D-SED will further enhance its capacity for flood forecasting and
   hydrological simulation for semihumid and humid hydroclimatic zones.}},

Title = {{Impact of robustness of hydrological model parameters on flood
   prediction uncertainty}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{The robustness of hydrological model parameter values in flood
   predictions is a known area of concern, but there is a lack of a
   comprehensive approach to the handling of model parameter robustness,
   model simulation uncertainty and multiobjective model calibration when
   calibrating multiple flood data sets. For investigation of the impact of
   robustness of hydrological model parameters on flood simulation
   uncertainty, this paper develops a Minimax-Regret robust multiobjective
   optimisation framework for robust hydrological model parameter
   calibration and uncertainty analysis. The robustness is considered as an
   objective function in this study instead of a constraint as in previous
   research. A physically based semi-distributed hydrological model is
   employed to illustrate the proposed framework in a midscale catchment.
   Results show that the proposed framework can effectively explore robust
   hydrological model parameter values and quantify flood simulation
   uncertainty. A trade-off between robustness and Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency is found, implying that the better the Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency, the less robust the non-dominated parameter values and that
   improving robustness alone cannot guarantee narrower uncertainty
   intervals and greater containing ratios. These results reveal that
   robustness should not be used alone to select behavioural parameter
   sets, and a balance has to be made between robustness and Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency.}},

   real-time flood forecasting in small urban catchments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Growing urbanisation and imperviousness have augmented magnitudes of
   peak flows, resulting in flooding especially during extreme events.
   Flood forecast of extreme events can rely on real-time ensemble flood
   forecasting systems. Such systems often use predictions from physical
   models and precipitation ensembles to predict downstream urban flood
   hydrographs. However, these methods are seldom used in small catchments,
   where flood predictions may assist emergency management. We explore the
   relative utility of two models, the Sacramento Model (SAC-SMA) and an
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for ensemble flood
   prediction for nine small urban catchments located near New York City.
   The models were used to reforecast streamflow for Hurricane Irene (160
   mm) and a 35 mm storm across lead times from 3 to 24 hr. Differences in
   performance between models were small for short (3 hr) lead times, and
   were similar for the 35 mm storm. Reforecasts of hurricane Irene at
   24-hr lead times show strong performance for SAC-SMA, but a decline in
   performance for ANFIS. Model performance did not vary systematically
   with either catchment size or imperviousness. Our results suggest that
   model selection is especially important when reforecasting large rain
   events with longer lead times in small urban catchments.}},

Abstract = {{This study is an assessment of flash flood risk in the downstream part
   of an intermittent stream which lost its natural bed due to intense
   human interventions, with the example of Hastane Brook in the province
   of Kirsehir (Turkey). The effects of flooding events with high, medium,
   and low probability of occurrence are investigated on a street-by-street
   basis with a two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model constructed in
   HEC-RAS 5.0 software. Due to the lack of records of past flood events
   required for model calibration, it is aimed to utilise high-quality data
   as much as possible in model development. Therefore, to more accurately
   simulate the movement of water and thereby to advise adequate measures
   for reducing the most likely flood effects, the required high-resolution
   terrain and land use data are produced by processing the aerial images
   acquired by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights over the flood
   risk zone. The estimation of flood hydrographs is only based on the
   synthetic unit hydrograph methods due to the absence of representative
   stream gauging stations inside or near the region. The resultant flood
   hazard maps are cautionary in terms of demonstrating the effects of
   possible floods that are unexpected to come from such an intermittent

Title = {{Rewilding in the Garden: are garden hybrid plants (cultivars) less
   resilient to the effects of hydrological extremes than their parent
   species? A case study with Primula}},
Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{22}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Urban green infrastructure, such as gardens, can mitigate some of the
   consequences of climate change, e.g. reducing flash-flooding or urban
   heat islands. Green infrastructure, however, may itself be vulnerable to
   a changing climate, and not all garden and landscape plant taxa will
   remain viable under weather scenarios predicted for the future. It has
   been suggested that cultivated forms of garden plants (hybrids and
   selected varieties) particularly, will be susceptible to enhanced stress
   associated with more frequent flooding, drought and rapid oscillations
   between these hydrological extremes; thus potentially limiting the range
   of taxa that can be used in gardens in the future. This research
   explored this concept by evaluating cultivated forms of the common
   garden plant - Primula, and testing whether these were less resilient to
   the effects of hydrological extremes than their progenitor species,
   Primula vulgaris. The results support this hypothesis and demonstrated
   that cultivated taxa were more susceptible to the hydrological stresses
   imposed than Primula vulgaris. Interestingly though, those cultivars
   that superficially resembled the parent species (Primula `Cottage
   Cream') showed more stress tolerance than others with larger or more
   ornamental flowers, suggesting a `gradient of susceptibility' within the
   hybrids. The notion that the most flamboyant cultivars are sacrificing
   stress tolerance for traits linked with aesthetics is discussed. The
   data, albeit on one genus only, has implications for the design of
   gardens/ornamental landscapes for the future and calls for more
   attention within breeding programmes to enhance abiotic stress tolerance
   within garden and landscape plants.}},

   mapping urban areas prone to flash floods in Qena governorate, Egypt}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{158}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods in Egypt are considered frequent meteorological natural
   hazards. Qena is one of the most Egyptian governorates prone to flash
   floods. Various flash floods events hit Qena from 1954 till 2016. Flash
   floods occurred in Qena on 28th October 2016 inundated houses and roads,
   generated losses in lives, damages to private and public property. The
   intensive rainfall coupled with the rapid urban expansion in Qena and
   along the Nile Valley could worsen the situation. Despite, the
   destructive impacts of the flash floods in Qena, flash floods can be
   used as a valuable source of fresh water as the study area is classified
   as an arid zone and characterized with the fresh-water shortage.
   Integration of remotely sensed data with the Analytical Hierarchy
   Process and Geographic Information Systems spatial modeling presented
   valuable analysis techniques in this study. The present study focused on
   mapping the spatial distribution of flash floods vulnerability in Qena's
   urban areas. Ten indicators were used to analyze the flood floods
   namely; rainfall, soil, geology, slope, elevation, flow direction,
   drainage network, land cover, total population, and population density.
   The results revealed that Qena, Qus, Naqadah, and Dishna urban districts
   are the most vulnerable to flash floods and located in the very high
   zone with 25.3\%, 14.9\%, 12.3\%, and 9.8\% respectively. The total
   population situated at very high and high vulnerability zone reached
   represents 7.66\% and 43.36\% of the total population. The obtained
   results considered crucial information for decision-makers for future
   effective flash floods hazards mitigation, assessment management,
   planning, and sustainable development.}},

Journal = {{WORLD DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{514-524}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Our paper analyses the patterns and factors that explain households'
   responses to extreme environmental events (EEEs) in two case studies of
   indigenous communities in the Solomon Islands. We used the ethnographic
   approach to describe the case studies and carried out thematic analysis
   to disentangle the factors that explain such responses. The first case
   was that of a rural community from Ranogha Island in the Western
   Province that was hit by the Tsunami of April 2007; the second was of a
   community settled in an informal development on a flood-prone area in
   peri-urban Honiara that was hit by a flash flood in April 2014. Drawing
   from the villagers' experiences, we found that aid and support from
   family and community, referred to by the respondents as the ``wantok{''}
   system, was key to recovering from the disasters. Many respondents
   identified climate change as one leading factor that explained such
   catastrophic events. The social cooperation system, the government's
   role in responding to catastrophes and household net worth were
   identified among the main components of household responses. These
   constitute an effective engine to build palliative and preventive
   responses against catastrophic events and climate change risks. In spite
   of the extreme poverty observed, and the lack of government assistance,
   we conclude that amenities obtained from the community (through the
   wantok system) and household net worth (including the availability of
   common pool resources) enabled them to cope with the catastrophes. These
   factors are critical for long-term adaptation to EEEs and climate change
   risks. The community responses analysed with thematic analysis showed to
   be consistent with the conceptualization led by a farm-household model,
   and the household net worth as a source of income appears to be the
   correct measure of wealth instead the level of income in these less
   monetarised communities. Learning from how these communities and
   households responded to such EEEs provides evidence on how other
   communities could successfully adapt to increasing climate change risks.

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2) flooding has been widely applied to enhance oil
   recovery. In low temperature reservoirs, CO2 injection may result in the
   formation of three hydrocarbon phases at thermodynamic equilibrium. In
   addition, an aqueous phase is always present in the reservoir. The
   aqueous phase can coexist with three hydrocarbon phases to form a
   four-phase equilibrium system. To evaluate CO2 utilization and storage
   in these low temperature petroleum reservoirs, a robust and efficient
   four-phase equilibrium calculation framework involving water is
   necessary for a compositional reservoir simulator. This is challenging
   not only because the number of variables increases but also because
   stability analysis becomes much complicated as the number of phases
   increases.
   In this research a novel four-phase equilibrium calculation framework is
   proposed for compositional reservoir simulation. A reduced variables
   method is used to solve four-phase flash problems efficiently and
   robustly. Multiphase flash calculations using reduced variables (RV) can
   converge to the equilibrium solution faster than formulations using
   conventional variables (Petitfrere and Nichita, 2015). Secondly, RV does
   not suffer from numerical problems in the Newton iterations when trace
   components are present in the aqueous phase. In addition to the
   implementation of the RV formulation, a systematic procedure consisting
   of stability analysis and flash calculations is proposed without any
   prior knowledge of initial K-values. Sets of different initial K-values
   are appropriately tested in each stability analysis.
   We performed comprehensive testing using characterized fluids found in
   the literature in order to validate the robustness of the proposed
   procedure. The four-phase regions in pressure-composition (Px) space
   could be accurately identified using our procedure. On the other hand,
   in some instances mixtures were incorrectly evaluated as three-phase
   when using existing approaches such as Li and Firoozabadi (2012). Our
   approach proposed in this paper is a promising four-phase equilibrium
   calculation framework for compositional reservoir simulation. The
   procedure achieved excellent robustness and efficiency with minimal
   modification to the conventional two or three-phase equilibrium
   calculation framework (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lower Permian continental deposits of the fault-controlled Orobic Basin
   (Central Southern Alps; Northern Italy) include alluvial fan facies
   interfingering with muddy basin-floor deposits, consisting of three
   facies associations: heterolithic fine-grained siliciclastic facies,
   laminated sandstone facies, and oncoidal limestone facies. Besides
   oncoidal and microbial limestones, carbonates occur as nodules in sandy
   tabular beds within the laminated sandstone facies association.
   Microfacies analyses distinguish several types of oncoidal carbonate
   (consisting of an alternation of microbial carbonate and fibrous
   calcite) and carbonate nodules. Each type of carbonate has been
   characterized in terms of delta O-18 and delta C-13. The two types of
   carbonate in the oncoids record a stable delta O-18 and a slightly
   varying delta C-13, whereas the isotope composition of the calcite in
   nodules is completely different. Carbonate nodules in sandy beds of the
   laminated sandstone facies association have a diagenetic origin as
   indicated by cross-cutting relationships between nodules and lamination;
   the nodules are interpreted as groundwater calcrete, formed in the
   subsurface at the top of the unconfined water table. The exclusive
   sedimentation of oncoidal carbonate facies within siliciclastic deposits
   indicates that when oncoids were formed in ephemeral shallow ponds,
   siliciclastic input was minimal. The sedimentological and geochemical
   characteristics of the studied succession and the stable isotopic
   composition of the oncoids (the absence of covariance between delta O-18
   and delta C-13 excludes deposition in evaporating basins) indicate
   persistent stable conditions for sufficient time to permit growth of
   centimeter-sized oncoids. Oncoids are interpreted to have formed in
   spring-fed ponds and outflow channels, with flowing, clean water, at the
   toe of major alluvial fans. Episodes of rapid delivery of sand and
   silt-sized sediments by flash floods, with an oscillating water table,
   caused the observed facies alternation. The precipitation of calcareous
   cements close to the water table surface produced nodules in sandy
   layers. Carbonate precipitation within laminated sandstone reduced
   porosity and permeability, causing a strong compartmentalization in the
   well-bedded continental succession.}},

Abstract = {{Floods and flash floods are frequent in the south of Europe resulting
   from heavy rainfall events that often produce more than 200 mm in less
   than 24 h. Even though the meteorological conditions favourable for
   these situations have been widely studied, there is a lingering question
   that still arises: what humidity sources could explain so much
   precipitation? To answer this question, the regional atmospheric Weather
   Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with a recently implemented
   moisture tagging capability has been used to analyse the main moisture
   sources for two catastrophic flood events that occurred during the
   autumn of 1982 (October and November) in the western Mediterranean area,
   which is regularly affected by these types of adverse weather episodes.
   The procedure consists in selecting a priori potential moisture source
   regions for the extreme event under consideration, and then performing
   simulations using the tagging technique to quantify the relative
   contribution of each selected source to total precipitation. For these
   events we study the influence of four possible potential sources: (1)
   evaporation in the western Mediterranean; (2) evaporation in the central
   Mediterranean; (3) evaporation in the North Atlantic; and (4) advection
   from the tropical and subtropical Atlantic and Africa. Results show that
   these four moisture sources explain most of the accumulated
   precipitation, with the tropical and subtropical input being the most
   relevant in both cases. In the October event, evaporation in the western
   and central Mediterranean and in the North Atlantic also had an
   important contribution. However, in the November episode tropical and
   subtropical moisture accounted for more than half of the total
   accumulated rainfall, while evaporation in the western Mediterranean and
   North Atlantic played a secondary role and the contribution of the
   central Mediterranean was almost negligible. Therefore, remote sources
   were crucial: in the October event they played a similar role to local
   sources, whereas in the November case they were clearly dominant. In
   both episodes, long-distance moisture transport from the tropics and
   subtropics mostly occurred in mid-tropospheric layers, via well-defined
   moisture plumes with maximum mixing ratios at medium levels.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasting flash floods some hours in advance is still a challenge,
   especially in environments made up of many small catchments.
   Hydrometeorological forecasting systems generally allow for predicting
   the possibility of having very intense rainfall events on quite large
   areas with good performances, even with 12-24 h of anticipation.
   However, they are not able to predict the exact rainfall location if we
   consider portions of a territory of 10 to 1000 km(2) as the order of
   magnitude. The scope of this work is to exploit both observations and
   modelling sources to improve the discharge prediction in small
   catchments with a lead time of 2-8 h.
   The models used to achieve the goal are essentially (i) a probabilistic
   rainfall nowcasting model able to extrapolate the rainfall evolution
   from observations, (ii) a non-hydrostatic high-resolution numerical
   weather prediction (NWP) model and (iii) a distributed hydrological
   model able to provide a streamflow prediction in each pixel of the
   studied domain. These tools are used, together with radar observations,
   in a synergistic way, exploiting the information of each element in
   order to complement each other. For this purpose observations are used
   in a frequently updated data assimilation framework to drive the NWP
   system, whose output is in turn used to improve the information as input
   to the nowcasting technique in terms of a predicted rainfall volume
   trend; finally nowcasting and NWP outputs are blended, generating an
   ensemble of rainfall scenarios used to feed the hydrological model and
   produce a prediction in terms of streamflow.
   The flood prediction system is applied to three major events that
   occurred in the Liguria region (Italy) first to produce a standard
   analysis on pre-defined basin control sections and then using a
   distributed approach that exploits the capabilities of the employed
   hydrological model. The results obtained for these three analysed events
   show that the use of the present approach is promising. Even if not in
   all the cases, the blending technique clearly enhances the prediction
   capacity of the hydrological nowcasting chain with respect to the use of
   input coming only from the nowcasting technique; moreover, a worsening
   of the performance is observed less, and it is nevertheless ascribable
   to the critical transition between the nowcasting and the NWP model
   rainfall field.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial blight (BB) disease and submergence due to flash flood are the
   two major constraints for achieving higher yield from rainfed lowland
   rice. Marker-assisted backcross breeding was followed to develop
   submergence tolerant and durable BB resistant variety in the background

   xa13, Xa21 and Sub1 QTL for submergence tolerance were incorporated into
   the mega variety. Foreground selection for the five target genes was
   performed using closely linked markers and tracked in each backcross
   generations. Background selection in plants carrying the target genes
   was performed by using 100 simple sequence repeat markers. Amongst
   backcross derivatives, the plant carrying five target genes and maximum
   recurrent parent genome content was selected in each generation and
   hybridized with recipient parent. Eighteen BC3F2 plants were obtained by
   selfing the selected BC3F1 line. Amongst the pyramided lines, 3 lines
   were homozygous for all the target genes. Bioassay of the 18 pyramided
   lines containing BB resistance genes was conducted against different Xoo
   strains conferred very high levels of resistance to the predominant
   isolates. The pyramided lines also exhibited submergence tolerance for
   14 days. The pyramided lines were similar to the recurrent parent in 14

Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{751-763}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Due to the steep slope of mountainous watersheds and large changes in
   vegetation coverage degree, flood response processes after rainstorms
   are complicated. The flow concentration time of the slope is a key
   parameter for the simulation of flood processes. The most widely used
   flow concentration time formula currently in the distributed
   hydrological model is T = L(0.6)n(0.6)i(-0.4)S(-0.3), which is derived
   from the kinematic wave theory (Melesse and Graham in J Am Water Resour
   As 40(4):863-879, 2004; Lee in Hydrol Sci 53(2):323-337, 2008). The flow
   confluence time T is characterized by the constant exponent of the slope
   length L, roughness n, effective rainfall intensity i and slope S, and
   the influence of vegetation on the flow concentration time is implied by
   the roughness. In this study, a series of heavy rainfall slope surface
   confluence tests under different slopes and vegetation coverage were
   carried out, a vegetation coverage factor, C, which was introduced, a
   statistical analysis method was used, and the vegetation coverage index
   was fitted. The results showed that the types of vegetation have a
   certain influence on the flow concentration time of slope, and the flow
   confluence time under turf vegetation was larger than the flow
   confluence time under shrubs vegetation; especially in the slope of the
   larger slope, the relative impact is more significant; at the same time,
   the influence of vegetation coverage on the flow concentration time of
   slope was more significant; no matter the condition of turf or shrub,
   the slope confluence time increased obviously with the increase in
   vegetation coverage. The index of vegetation coverage factor C varied
   with the slope and rain intensity. In general, the index of vegetation
   coverage factor C increased with the decrease in slope and decreased
   with the increase in rain intensity. In regard to the turf vegetation
   coverage index, when the slope is 45 degrees and 30 degrees, the
   decreasing trend of the vegetation coverage index a(0) is obvious with
   increasing rainfall intensity. When the slope is 15 degrees, the
   vegetation coverage index a(0) also decreases with increasing rainfall
   intensity. When the slope is 5 degrees, the vegetation coverage index
   a(0) basically has no change. In regard to the shrubs vegetation
   coverage index, when the slope is 45 degrees and 30 degrees, the
   decreasing trend of the vegetation coverage index a(0) is obvious with
   increasing rainfall intensity. When the slope is 15 degrees, the
   vegetation coverage index a(0) also decreases with increasing rainfall
   intensity. When the slope is 5 degrees, the vegetation coverage index

Abstract = {{Several regions of the world have been affected by one of the natural
   disasters named as flash floods. Many villagers who live near stream or
   dam, they suffer a lot in terms of property, cattle and human lives
   loss. Conventional early warning systems are not up to the mark for the
   early warning announcements. Diversified approaches have been carried
   out for the identification of flash floods with less false alarm rate.
   Forecasting approaches includes some errors and ambiguity due to the
   incompetent processing algorithms and measurement readings. Process
   variables like stream flow, water level, water color, precipitation
   velocity, wind speed, wave's pattern and cloud to ground (CG) flashes
   have been measured for the robust identification of flash floods. A
   vibrant competent algorithm would be required for the investigation of
   flash floods with less false alarm rate. In this research paper
   classifiers have been applied on the collected data set so that any
   researcher could easily know that which classifier is competent and can
   be further enhanced by combining it with other algorithms. A novel
   comprehensive parametric comparison has been performed to investigate
   the classification accuracy for the robust classification of false
   alarms. For the better accuracy more than one process variables have
   been measured but still contained some false alarm. Appropriate
   combination of sensor was integrated to increase the accuracy in results
   as multi-modal sensing device has been designed to collect the data.
   Linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, quadratic support
   vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and Ensemble bagged tree have been
   applied to the collected data set for the data classification. Results
   have been obtained in the MATLAB and discussed in detail in the research
   paper. The worst accuracy of the classification (62\%) has been achieved
   by the coarse k-NN classifier that means coarse k-NN produced 38\% false
   negative rate that is not acceptable in the case of forecasting.
   Ensemble bagged trees produced best classification results as it
   achieved 99 \% accuracy and 1\% error rate. Furthermore, according to
   the comprehensive parametric comparison of regression models Quadratic
   SVM found to be the worst with mean square error of 0.5551 and time
   elapsed 13.159 seconds. On the other hand, Exponential Gaussian process
   regression performed better than the other existing approaches with the
   minimum root mean squared error of 0.0002 and prediction speed of 35000
   observations per second.}},

Abstract = {{Hydro-climatic risk assessments at the regional scale are of little use
   in the risk treatment decision-making process when they are only based
   on local or scientific knowledge and when they deal with a single risk
   at a time. Local and scientific knowledge can be combined in a
   multi-hazard risk assessment to contribute to sustainable rural
   development. The aim of this article was to develop a multi-hazard risk
   assessment at the regional scale which classifies communities according
   to the risk level, proposes risk treatment actions, and can be
   replicated in the agropastoral, semi-arid Tropics. The level of
   multi-hazard risk of 13 communities of Hodh Chargui (Mauritania) exposed
   to meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought, as well as
   heavy precipitations, was ascertained with an index composed of 48
   indicators representing hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive
   capacity. Community meetings and visits to exposed items enabled
   specific indicators to be identified. Scientific knowledge was used to
   determine the hazard with Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation
   with Station (CHIRPS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)
   datasets, Landsat images, and the method used to rank the communities.
   The northern communities are at greater risk of agricultural drought and
   those at the foot of the uplands are more at risk of heavy rains and
   consequent flash floods. The assessment proposes 12 types of actions to
   treat the risk in the six communities with severe and high multi-hazard
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of research on instream large wood (LW) focuses on
   perennial streams in temperate zones, and much less is known about wood
   distribution and its driving factors in other environments, such as
   semiarid bioclimatic regions. In this study, we sought to predict LW
   retention by assessing reach-scale variables to infer the influence of
   external factors on the presence of LW in 37 independent reaches of
   ephemeral and intermittent streams draining a mountain range in a
   Mediterranean semiarid environment (Lefka Ori Mountains, Crete, Greece).
   In addition, we focused on LW pieces that had been mobilized by fluvial
   transport to find links between wood mobility and the external
   reach-scale characteristics of this environment. Markedly low average LW
   frequency (6.5 LW/100 m) and volume (9.06 m(3)/ha) were observed in the
   studied reaches in comparison with streams draining other bioclimatic
   regions. Only one complex general linear model was found to predict LW
   volume (including valley confinement and basal area of coniferous
   trees), and five explanatory variables (elevation as a proxy of annual
   precipitation, valley type, valley confinement index, basal area of
   coniferous trees, and basal area of all trees) were significant in
   separated models predicting LW volume. Only two variables (valley floor
   width and the basal area of broadleaf trees) were significant in
   separated models for prediction of LW frequency. The mobilized LW in the
   studied streams tends to be stored as individual, dispersed pieces
   rather than in jams, likely due to overall low LW abundance which
   effectively prevents clustering of wood.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Since the nineteenth century, most urban catchments in Europe have been
   subject to significant landscape variations. These modifications have
   been caused by population change and the transition through rural,
   industrial and post-industrial economies. Land use and rainfall regime
   changes, together with land use variations, are frequently associated
   with flood hazard increase. This paper examines geomorphological
   landscape changes from the nineteenth century to the present day in the
   Bisagno Valley, Genoa metropolitan area. The Valley is internationally
   known for its recurring floods: the last events with fatalities occurred
   in 2011 and 2014. The extent of landscape change and the history of
   floods were examined by combining scientific data and information from
   historical maps, written accounts, topographical drawings and
   photographs. Historical-geographical and geomorphological analyses were
   used to reconstruct the runoff for three different periods since 1850.
   Our results demonstrate that geomorphological landscape variations,
   including modifications of the river bed, and the abandonment of the
   countryside and terraces are not sustainable and have progressively
   allowed an increase in flooding, making it necessary to implement
   sustainable management policies. In particular, specific spatial urban
   planning and management measures are necessary in order to mitigate
   flood hazard and vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{During the twentieth century, the intensity and frequency of extreme
   events (e.g., storms and floods) have significantly altered globally due
   to human-induced climate change. Recently, it has been recognized that
   some regions in Egypt have exposed to extreme rainfall events which led
   in some cases to severe flash floods. In this work, the variability of
   rainfall characteristics in Egypt was investigated based on a detailed
   statistical analysis of historical rainfall records at 31 stations. Both
   parametric (Pearson) and non-parametric (Mann-Kendall and Spearman)
   tests were applied on annual and seasonal precipitation indices to
   examine temporal trends. A classification of significant trends was
   introduced to assess the degrees of their likelihood. The results
   detected significant trends in annual indices: maximum precipitation,
   total precipitation, simple daily intensity index, and number of rainy
   days at 29, 19, 19, and 13\% of stations, respectively. Significant
   trends in seasonal indices were also found at a few stations. For all
   indices, 77\% of the detected significant trends are negative concluding
   a decrease in the amount of precipitation in Egypt. Additionally, only
   6\% of the detected trends are classified as less likely, while the rest
   is likely and extremely likely, indicating a high probability of most
   detected trends. Generally, the detected trends do not form any spatial
   pattern in all cases. The results also provided a preliminary impression
   on the likely impacts of climate change on rainfall characteristics in
   Egypt.}},

Abstract = {{Dense urbanization leading to uncontrolled transformations within
   settlements result in flash flooding with overflowing drains leading to
   a greater inconvenience for the public and damage to private properties.
   Hence mapping of flash floods would be useful in identifying the
   high-risk flood zones for disaster response and urban services, during
   emergencies with rainfall events of high intensity. This article aims to
   prepare a flood hazard map of Warangal Municipal Corporation (WMC) in
   Telangana State, India. WMC is chronically affected due to a rise in
   water levels resulting in flash floods, with an increase in
   encroachments. The factors considered in this study are rainfall (curve
   number), surface slope and surface roughness, type of soil, and distance
   to main channel, drainage density, and land use cover. To decide the
   relative weight of the impact of each flood causative factors an
   Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was used. Accordingly, a composite
   Flood Hazard Index (FHI) has been derived by using the multiple-criteria
   decision-making tools by integrating these into a Geographical
   Information System (GIS). The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in
   Quantum GIS (QGIS), which is a hydrological model, was used to evaluate
   the projection of streamflow over the water basin and model parameters
   were optimized using water balance equations during calibration and

Abstract = {{The most frequent disasters in Western Saudi Arabia are flash floods,
   earthquakes and volcanism, especially submarine volcanism potentially
   causing tsunamis in the Red Sea and submarine mass movements, dust
   storms and droughts. As the consequences and effects of the climate
   change are expected to have an increasing impact on the intensity and
   occurrence of geohazards as flash floods, length of drought periods, or
   dust storms, the systematic, continuous monitoring of these hazards and
   affected areas using satellite data and integration of the results into
   a geographic information systems (GIS) database is an important issue
   for hazard preparedness and risk assessment. Visual interpretation and
   digital image processing of optical aerial and satellite images, as well
   as of radar images, combined with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission
   and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission
   (SRTM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR DEM data are
   used in this study for the mapping and inventory of areas prone to
   geohazards, such as flash floods or tsunami flooding. Causal or critical
   environmental factors influencing the disposition to be affected by
   hazards can be analyzed interactively in a GIS database. How remote
   sensing and GIS methods can contribute to the detection and
   continuously, standardized monitoring of geohazards in Western Saudi
   Arabia as part of a natural hazard geodatabase is demonstrated by
   several examples, such as the detection of areas prone to hydrological
   hazards, such as flash floods causing flooding of roads and settlements,
   the outlining of coastal areas of the Red Sea prone to tsunami flooding

Abstract = {{This study aims to assess the impact of flash floods in the Wadi Nu'man
   basin on urban areas, east of Mecca, which are subjected to frequent
   floods, during the period from 1988-2019. By producing and analyzing the
   maps of the regions, an integrated approach to geomatics and hydraulic
   modelling is employed. The following maps are used: Flood-prone urbanity
   from 1988-2019, a flood risk map of Wadi Nu'man based on a risk matrix
   map, and a map of the proposed protection measures and alternatives in
   the study area. In order to achieve these goals, changes in the land use
   in the Wadi Nu'man basin were monitored by analyzing successive
   satellite images, taken by the US satellite, Landsat, in 1988, 1998,
   2013, and 2019. Using a supervised classification, with the maximum
   likelihood method of ERDAS IMAGINE 2016, GIS was used in the production
   and analysis of soil maps, and geological and hydrological groups of
   drainage basins, as well as the hydrological model (HEC-HMS), were
   applied in calculating the hydrograph curve of the Wadi Nu'man basin.
   The flood water volumes and flow rates were estimated based on the SCS
   unit hydrograph, and the rain depth was analyzed and estimated for
   different periods. The hydraulic modeling program (HEC-RAS) was
   employed, when developing a two-dimensional model to calculate the
   speed, depth, and spread of the flood, in order to apply the risk matrix
   method. The recommendations based on this study give priority to the
   implementation of a flood prevention plan and the protection of
   infrastructure by maintaining the existing flood drainage facilities and
   establishing new drainage facilities to protect lives, property, and
   infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, findings of a research project about river bridges in
   Turkey are shared and details of the developed safety-inspection method
   based on hydrological and hydraulic factors are presented. In the
   project, the Western Black Sea Basin was chosen as the pilot area, where
   the basin is mountainous with steep slopes and has a rainy climate with
   frequent flash floods. Many river bridges in the basin were inspected at
   different flow conditions throughout the project duration of three
   years. The developed safety-inspection method is composed of four main
   parts: evaluation of watershed hydrology and its flood potential, stream
   stability, bridge characteristics and a rapid scour assessment. A
   structural assessment is also included in the method. Five river bridges
   in the area were chosen for detailed inspection and application of the
   method. Results showed that the method was capable of identifying and
   ranking the bridges in regard to maintenance needs and forming a
   comprehensive inventory for bridge engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Sao Vicente Island (Republic of Cape Verde) lies within the Sahelian
   zone and faces several natural hazards, one of which is flash flooding.
   With the purpose of understanding what factors determine flash flood
   risk perception, a questionnaire entitled Flash Flood Hazard Perception
   in Cape Verde was applied to 199 subjects. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   was performed to identify the primary factors associated with the
   perception of flash flood risk. Differences between different groups
   under the same impact factor were also compared. The results indicated
   that certain socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents
   (gender, level of education, and type of housing) and prior experience
   correlated with flash flood risk perception. The study also shows
   statistical differences between the groups. In general, males and the
   respondents with a high level of education, homeowners, and people with
   prior experience have better perception of the flash flood risk. These
   findings can help decision makers to improve effective flash flood risk
   communication policies and flood risk reduction strategies.}},

   Precipitation Nowcasts by Lagrangian Extrapolation}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The rainfall forecasts currently available in Korea are not sufficiently
   accurate to be directly applied to the flash flood warning system or
   urban flood warning system. As the lead time increases, the quality
   becomes even lower. In order to overcome this problem, this study
   proposes an ensemble forecasting method. The proposed method considers
   all available rainfall forecasts as ensemble members at the target time.
   The ensemble members are combined based on the weighted average method,
   where the weights are determined by applying the two conditions of the
   unbiasedness and minimum error variance. The proposed method is tested
   with McGill Algorithm for Precipitation Nowcasting by Lagrangian
   Extrapolation (MAPLE) rainfall forecasts for four storm events that
   occurred during the summers of 2016 and 2017 in Korea. In Korea,
   rainfall forecasts are generated every 10 min up to six hours, i.e.,
   there are always a total of 36 sets of rainfall forecasts. As a result,
   it is found that just six ensemble members is sufficient to make the
   ensemble forecast. Considering additional ensemble members beyond six
   does not significantly improve the quality of the ensemble forecast. The
   quality of the ensemble forecast is also found to be better than that of
   the single forecast, and the weighted average method is found to be
   better than the simple arithmetic average method.}},

Journal = {{WATER}},

Abstract = {{Sudden floods in the medium and small watershed by a sudden rainstorm
   and locally heavy rainfall often lead to flash floods. Therefore, it is
   of practical and theoretical significance to explore appropriate flood
   forecasting model for medium and small watersheds for flood control and
   disaster reduction in the loess region under the condition of underlying
   surface changes. This paper took the Gedong basin in the loess region of
   western Shanxi as the research area, analyzing the underlying surface
   and floods characteristics. The underlying surface change was divided
   into three periods (HSP1, HSP2, HSP3), and the floods were divided into
   three grades (great, moderate, small). The paper applied K Nearest
   Neighbor method and Fireworks Algorithm to improve the Extreme Learning
   Machine model (KNN-FWA-ELM) and proposed KNN-FWA-ELM hybrid flood
   forecasting model, which was further applied to flood forecasting of
   different underlying surface conditions and flood grades. Results
   demonstrated that KNN-FWA-ELM model had better simulation performance
   and higher simulation accuracy than the ELM model for flood forecasting,
   and the qualified rate was 17.39\% higher than the ELM model.
   KNN-FWA-ELM model was superior to the ELM model in three periods and the
   simulation performance of three flood grades, and the simulation
   performance of KNN-FWA-ELM model was better in HSP1 stage floods and
   great floods.}},

Title = {{Extracting quantitative data from non-conventional information for the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{576}},

Abstract = {{The description of the floods which have occurred in the past and an
   assessment of the adverse impacts they have entailed are among the
   duties required by the European Flood Directive. Indeed, to understand
   the consequences of a future flood on a city that in the past has
   already been affected by other flood events, it is very useful to
   reconstruct the hydraulic effects produced by those events. Such a task
   is particularly difficult for cases which occurred many years ago. For
   past events, it is often easier to have conventional hydrological data
   (for example, the hyetographs of the event) than conventional hydraulic
   data (recordings of flow rates, water depths, etc.). It is also
   difficult to obtain the topography valid for the period in which the
   event occurred. The greater the distance in time the greater the
   difficulty in gathering these data.
   In this paper we present a criterion for making a flow of information,
   using various non-conventional sources of information (such as amateur
   videos, photographs, traditional topographic surveys, news reports,
   etc.). In particular, it is shown how the data thus obtained can be used
   together in order to reconstruct numerically the hydraulic dynamics of a
   flood event in an urban area with a complete hydrodynamic model, which
   requires a particularly accurate computational domain.
   All these issues will be presented and discussed with reference to the
   numerical reconstruction of the flood event that occurred 23 years ago
   (1996) in the city of Crotone (Calabria, Italy).}},

Journal = {{DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{233-242}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Generally, porous weirs are considered as friendly environmental
   structures used to reduce the negative impact of flash floods. All
   previous studies used solid concrete weirs or gabion weirs that used
   gravels. Researches rarely deal with the performance of porous weirs
   hydraulically and environmentally together. In this study the hydraulic
   characteristic, flow types, and environment effect for porous weirs were
   studied experimentally and theoretically. Limestone was used instead of
   gravel as an adsorbent material for the porous weir to improve its
   efficiency for removing selected contaminants, including lead (Pb),
   turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS). The effect of limestone
   porous weir onto pH of the effluent water samples was also measured. The
   limestone permeable weir was investigated as an alternative to the solid
   concrete weir as it is cheaper, more environmentally friendly and also
   efficient in the removal of some river contaminants at the same.
   Two-dimensional numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling
   for flow over and through porous weirs was performed using the volume of
   fluid method and shear stress transport k-omega model for turbulence
   through ANSYS 16.1. Many samples of water were collected before and
   after the porous weir for environmental analysis. The results showed a
   good convergence between the CFD model and experimental results.
   Moreover, the results showed that the CFD model gave root mean square
   error values equal to 0.877, 0.979, and 0.625 cm, respectively for the
   three discharges selected, 0.4, 1.85, and 2.75 m(3) h(-1), respectively
   selected for comparison between the CFD model and the experimental work.
   On the environmental side, the effects of flow rates were studied at an
   initial concentration equal to 1.5 mg L-1 of Pb ions and 50 mg L-1 for
   turbidity. The designed weir shows good removal efficiency for both lead
   and turbidity. The maximum removal efficiency was found to be 92.5\%,
   72\% and 59\% for lead, turbidity and TSS, respectively. The greater the
   time the lower the removal of pollutants, and lower discharge resulted
   in a greater percentage of removal.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the amount of surface runoff reaching crossing point of a
   watershed stream with a highway is critical for accurate design of safe
   hydraulic structures and flood protection. Sharqu ElNeil locality of
   Khartoum, Sudan, has been subject to repeated flash floods amplified by
   the presence of Alilafon Street, which runs in the NW-SE direction
   forming a terrace obstructing the natural flow of seasonal streams
   towards the Blue Nile River plain. Existing structures (culverts) are
   unable to pass stream water. They were either insufficient in terms of
   cross sectional area, ill-designed, or were displaced due to unplanned
   urbanization. Therefore, the (SCS)-curve number (CN) method developed by
   US Soil Conservation Service was used combined with geographical
   information systems (GIS) in order to estimate peak discharge reaching
   stream crossing points and to re-evaluate existing hydraulic structures.
   From hydrological modeling and field survey, eight catchments and
   crossing points were identified. Catchment area ranged between 13.4 and
   42.1 km(2) while the CN value ranged between 80 and 90. Rainfall
   intensity was obtained from frequency analysis of 100-year rainfall
   data. It has ranged between 5.5 and 65 mm/h for the 10-year return
   period. Computed peak discharge values ranged between 15.6 and 47.2
   m(3)/s. Hydraulic structures were designed for each crossing point based
   on Manning formula. One new culvert and amendments for five existing
   structures were proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In 2010, flash floods triggered by Hurricane Alex caused fifteen
   fatalities in the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA). In contrast, an
   estimated 225 people died in the 1988 Hurricane Gilbert disaster and
   reputedly, over 5,000 in the historical flood of 1909. The magnitude of
   hurricane-related impacts thus appears to be decreasing, indicating
   higher resilience to this hazard. This paper analyses the process of
   building resilience to flash floods in the MMA over the last several
   decades. Knowledge co-production plays a significant role in that
   process, particularly through the Nuevo Leon State Reconstruction
   Council, the multi-institutional, public-private-civil group of
   stakeholders established to guide and coordinate reconstruction efforts
   following the Hurricane Alex disaster. Findings reveal a complex,
   protracted and incremental resilience building process, conditioned by
   the nature of the hazard (infrequent but liable to cause significant
   damages) and contingent upon the city's socioeconomic and institutional
   local context. This local context is embedded in a highly fragmented
   national water governance architecture that lacks inter-institutional
   co-ordination and has limited the city's adaptive responses. Despite
   definite gains in building resilience, the city faces challenges notably
   in terms of the conservation and continuing development of knowledge
   co-produced in the aftermath of disasters.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid urbanisation increasingly affects small and medium-sized towns
   adversely in high mountain regions, which are especially vulnerable to
   socioecological challenges like depleting natural resources and
   increasing risk exposure to natural hazards. The case study of Leh town,
   located in the Indian Himalaya, reveals an array of diverse patterns,
   drivers, and challenges that characterise the process of mountain
   urbanisation. Our study is based on an integrated methodological
   approach using very high resolution multi-temporal satellite imagery,
   field mapping and social research data to track socioeconomic and
   political developments. A rapid spatial expansion of housing settlements
   on both, former agricultural and barren land along with a densification
   of built-up areas can be observed. Between 2003 and 2017, 9400 new
   buildings were constructed whereas in the 34 years before (from 1969 to
   2003), approximately the same number of new buildings were constructed.
   The building area more than quintupled from 36 ha to 196 ha between 1969
   and 2017. Consequentially, agricultural land loss through construction
   activities increased from 1\% in 1969 to 8\% in 2017. Urban growth in
   Leh is driven by administrative and infrastructure development, a
   booming tourism sector, the diffusion of urban lifestyles, and the
   region's geopolitical importance. The emerging socio-ecological
   challenges are tackled by different local actors. Our findings raise
   questions on the consequences of such rapid urbanisation on urban and
   environmental governance, especially with regard to water resources and
   natural hazards, and we offer practical recommendations for sustainable
   town planning.}},

Title = {{Norms, practices, and gendered vulnerabilities in the lower Teesta
   basin, Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{88-96}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.
   Gendered vulnerability and its implications for people's ability to cope
   with and adapt to climatic stressors was investigated in four poor rural
   communities in Dimla, Kaunia, Hatibandha, and Patgram upazilas
   (sub-districts) in Rangpur division in the lower Teesta basin area in
   northwest Bangladesh. These areas are strongly affected by seasonal
   floods, flash floods, river bank erosion, and drought throughout the
   year. Socioeconomic stressors coupled with these climatic stressors lead
   to a high level of gendered vulnerability among the villagers, which is
   likely to be exacerbated in extreme climatic situations. Asymmetrical
   gender divisions make women disproportionately vulnerable and decrease
   their coping and adaptive capacity in changed situations. The study
   showed that women are the most vulnerable amongst vulnerable groups, not
   simply as a result of their gender roles and responsibilities, but more
   as a result of discriminatory social norms and practices such as lack of
   property ownership, lack of education, early marriage, the dowry system,
   and acceptance of domestic violence against women, which further create
   barriers to women's mobility and economic empowerment. Women are
   conditioned to remain at home and not participate, or to wait for men to
   accompany them to most activities taking place in the public space.
   Although significant numbers of women have been engaging in income
   generating activities, creating cooperative funds, and saving money,
   this is still within the confines of their private space. Government
   policy to empower women through free education is partly effective but
   the dominant patriarchal practice of early marriage and dowry discourage
   women from coming forward. The study concludes that the prevalent gender
   discriminatory norms and practices must be addressed to achieve gender
   transformative change, which is an essential requirement for gender
   equity and inclusive social development. Government policies and
   programs should be revised to address women's practical and strategic
   needs for gender transformative change.}},

Abstract = {{Flood-risk is affected by both climatic and anthropogenic factors. In
   this study, we assess changes in flood risk induced by a combination of
   climate change and flood prevention sets in the Baiyangdian (BYD) Lake
   area of China. Extreme storm events are analysed by the bias-corrected
   climate data from global climate models. A hydrological model is
   implemented and integrated with a hydrodynamic model to assess flood
   risk under three scenarios. The streamflow into the BYD was validated
   against historical flash-flood events. The results indicate that the
   changing climate increased extreme precipitation, upstream total inflow
   and the flood risk at the core region of Xiong'an New Area (XNA), the
   newly announced special economic zone in the BYD area. However, flood
   prevention measures can effectively mitigate the climatic effect. The
   research highlights the severe flash-flood risk at BYD and demonstrates

Abstract = {{CO2 flooding is an effective enhanced oil recovery process for light oil
   reservoirs. Asphaltenes can easily precipitate during CO2 flooding,
   leading to the appearance of three-phase vapor-liquid-asphaltene (VLS)
   equilibria. A prerequisite for accurately simulating the CO2 flooding
   process is developing a robust three-phase VLS equilibrium calculation
   algorithm. In this study, we develop a robust and efficient three-phase
   VLS equilibrium calculation algorithm with the use of asphaltene
   precipitation model proposed by Nghiem et al. {[}Efficient Modelling of
   Asphaltene Precipitation, SPE, 1993]. To develop this algorithm, a
   two-phase flash calculation algorithm is first developed to split the
   mixture into an asphaltene phase and a nonasphaltene phase. Moreover,
   two different three-phase VLS flash calculation algorithms are developed
   and incorporated into our three-phase equilibrium calculation algorithm.
   New initialization approaches for both stability test and flash
   calculations are proposed. The performance of this three-phase VLS
   equilibrium calculation algorithm is tested by generating
   pressure-composition (P-X) diagrams for several reservoir fluids mixed
   with pure or impure CO2.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme hydrometeorological events such as hurricanes and cyclones are

   Preparedness and response measures need to concentrate on toxicological

   and threat to human lives. The recognition of the danger of flood water
   after hurricanes is critical. Effective health management needs to
   consider the likelihood and specific risks of toxic agents present in
   waters contaminated by chemical spills, bio-toxins, waste, sewage, and
   water-borne pathogens. Despite significant progress in the ability to
   rapidly detect and test water for a wide range of chemicals and
   pathogens, there has been a lack of implementation to adapt toxicity
   measurements in the context of flash and hurricane-induced flooding. The
   aim of this review was to highlight the need to collect and analyze data
   on toxicity of flood waters to understand the risks and prepare
   vulnerable communities and first responders. It is proposed that new and

   rapidly assess toxicity and infectious disease threats, and subsequently

Abstract = {{Minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) is one of the most important design
   parameters in CO2 flooding. Recent experimental studies show that
   asphaltene precipitation in light oils increases the MMP between
   injection gas and crude oil. To model the asphaltene-precipitation
   effect on MMP calculations, we develop a three-phase
   multiple-mixing-cell (MMC) algorithm by considering three-phase
   vapor-liquid-asphaltene (VLS) equilibria. This algorithm is developed by
   modifying the MMC method proposed by Ahmadi and Johns (Soc. Pet. Eng. J.
   2011, 16, 4, 733). The three-phase VLS equilibrium calculation algorithm
   developed by Li and Li (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2019, in press) is
   integrated into the two-phase MMC algorithm. Several example
   calculations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of our
   algorithm. The MMPs predicted by our algorithm and those predicted by
   the two-phase MMC algorithm are both compared with the MMPs measured by
   experiments. Comparison results show that MMPs predicted by our
   algorithm have a slightly better agreement with the experimental results

Abstract = {{High-intensity precipitation represents a threat for several regions of
   the world because of the related risk of natural disasters (e.g. floods
   and landslides). This work focuses on low-level precipitation
   enhancement that occurs in the cloud warm layer and has been observed in
   relation to collision-coalescence (CC) leading to flash floods and
   extreme rainfall events in tropical and temperate latitudes.
   Specifically, signatures of precipitation enhancement (referred to as
   CC-dominant precipitation) are investigated in the observations from the
   Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core mission Dual-frequency
   Precipitation Radar (DPR) over the central/eastern Contiguous United
   States (CONUS) during June 2014-May 2018. A classification scheme for
   CC-dominant precipitation, developed for dual-polarization S-band radar
   measurements and applied in a previous work to X-band radar observations
   in complex terrain, is used as a benchmark. The scheme is here applied
   to the GPM ground validation dataset that matches ground-based radar
   observations across CONUS to space-borne DPR retrievals. The occurrence
   of CC-dominant precipitation is documented and the corresponding
   signatures of CC-dominant precipitation at Ku- and Ka-band are studied.
   CC-dominant profiles show distinguishing features when compared to
   profiles not dominated by CC, e.g. characteristic vertical slopes of
   reflectivity at Ku- and Ka-band in the liquid layer, lower
   freezing-level height, and shallower ice layer, which are linked to
   environmental conditions driving the peculiar CC microphysics. This work
   aims at improving satellite quantitative precipitation estimation,
   particularly GPM retrievals, by targeting CC development in
   precipitation columns.}},

Abstract = {{Event-based models are often used for flood prediction because they
   require fewer data than more complex models and account for a small
   number of parameters. We present the performance of such a model in
   simulating Mediterranean floods, with a focus on the initialization and
   on the impact of the rainfall uncertainties on the calibration of the
   model. The distributed event-based parsimonious Soil Conservation
   Service Lag-and-Route (SCS-LR) model was applied in the Real Collobrier
   catchment, France, which has a very high density of raingauges. The
   initial condition of the model was highly correlated with predictors,
   such as baseflow or soil water content. A reduction in the raingauge
   density can markedly change the calibration of the model. As the density
   of raingauges is generally low in most catchments, the uncertainties
   associated with rainfall measurement are thus expected either to mask
   the actual accuracy of the model, or to alter the model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{For most of the year, a dry-bed desert wash is void of water flow.
   Intensive rain events, however, could trigger significant flash floods
   that bring about highly complicated hydrodynamics and morphodynamics
   processes within a desert stream. We present a fully coupled three-phase
   flow model of air, water, and sediment to simulate numerically the
   propagation of a flash flood in a field-scale fluvial desert stream, the
   so-called Tex Wash located in the Mojave Desert, California, United
   States. The turbulent flow of the flash flood is computed using the
   three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations
   closed with the shear stress transport k - omega model. The free surface
   of the flash flood at the interface of air and water phases is computed
   with the level-set method, which enables instantaneous tracking of the
   water surface as the flash flood propagates over the dry bed of the
   desert stream. The evolution of the desert fluvial stream's morphology,
   due to the action of the propagating flash flood on the mobile bed, is
   calculated using a Eulerian morphodynamics model based on the
   curvilinear immersed boundary method. The capabilities of the proposed
   numerical framework are demonstrated by applying it to simulate a flash
   flood event in a 0.65-km-long reach of the Tex Wash, the intricate
   channel morphology of which is obtained using light imaging detection
   and ranging technology. The simulated region of the stream includes a
   number of bridge foundations. The simulation results of the model for
   the flash flood event revealed the formation of a highly complex flow
   field and scour patterns within the stream. Moreover, our simulation
   results showed that most scour processes take place during the steady
   phase of the flash flood, that is, after the flash flood fills the
   stream. The transient phase of the flash flood is rather short and
   contributes to a very limited amount of erosion within the desert
   stream.}},

Title = {{Real-time monitoring and estimation of the discharge of flash floods in

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{3195-3212}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Synchronously and accurately estimating the flood discharges and dynamic
   changes in the fluid density is essential for hydraulic analysis and
   forecasting of flash floods, as well as for risk assessment. However,
   such information is rare for steep mountain catchments, especially in
   regions that are hotspots for earthquakes. Therefore, six hydrological
   monitoring sites were established in the main stream and tributaries of
   the 78.3-km(2) Longxi River catchment, an affected region of the
   Wenchuan earthquake region in China. Direct real-time monitoring
   equipment was installed to measure the flow depths, velocities, and
   fluid total pressures of the flood hydrographs. On the basis of field
   measurements, real-time mean cross-sectional velocities during the flood
   hydrographs could be derived from easily obtainable parameters:
   cross-sectional maximum velocities and the calibrated dimensionless
   parameter K-h. Real-time discharges were determined on the basis of a
   noncontact method to establish the effective rating curves of this
   mountainous stream, ranging from 1.46 to 386.34 m(3)/s with the root
   mean square errors of <= 10.22 m(3)/s. Compared with the traditional
   point-velocity method and empirical Manning's formula, the proposed
   noncontact method was reliable and safe for monitoring whole flood
   hydrographs. Additionally, the real-time fluid density during the flood
   hydrographs was calculated on the basis of the direct monitoring
   parameters for fluid total pressures and water depths. During the flood
   hydrograph, transient flow behaviour with higher fluid density generally
   occurred downstream during the flood peak periods when the flow was in
   the supercritical flow regime. The observed behaviour greatly increased
   the threat of damage to infrastructure and human life near the river.
   Thus, it is important to accurately estimate flood discharge and
   identify for fluid densities so that people at risk from an impending
   flash flood are given reliable, advanced warning.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we developed an enhanced approach for large-scale flood
   damage and risk assessments that uses characteristics of buildings and
   the built environment as object-based information to represent exposure
   and vulnerability to flooding. Most current large-scale assessments use
   an aggregated land-use category to represent the exposure, treating all
   exposed elements the same. For large areas where previously only coarse
   information existed such as in Africa, more detailed exposure data are
   becoming available. For our approach, a direct relation between the
   construction type and building material of the exposed elements is used
   to develop vulnerability curves. We further present a method to
   differentiate flood risk in urban and rural areas based on
   characteristics of the built environment. We applied the model to
   Ethiopia and found that rural flood risk accounts for about 22\% of
   simulated damage; rural damage is generally neglected in the typical
   land-use-based damage models, particularly at this scale. Our approach
   is particularly interesting for studies in areas where there is a large
   variation in construction types in the building stock, such as
   developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{Taking a representative catchment of the Yangtze River Delta region as
   the study area, this research evaluated sub-daily rainstorm variability
   and its potential effects on flood processes based on an integrated
   approach of the HEC-HMS model and design storm hyetographs. The results
   show that the intensities of rainfall on sub-daily scale are getting
   more extreme. The annual maximum 1-, 2- and 3-hour rainstorms followed
   significant upward trends with increases of 0.32, 0.43 and 0.44 mm per
   year, respectively, while the annual maximum 6-, 12- and 24-h events had
   non-significant rising trends. The detected significant trends in
   short-duration rainstorms were then used to redesign storm hyetographs
   to drive the HEC-HMS model, the results show that these changes in
   short-duration rainstorm characteristics would increase the flood peak

Abstract = {{The main objective of this research work was to propose and verify a new
   soft computing approach based on Multivariate Adaptive Regression
   Splines (MARS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for spatial
   prediction of flash flood susceptible areas. A high frequency tropical
   typhoon area located on Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case
   study. For this purpose, a GIS database for the study areas was
   prepared, including 654 flash-flood inundations and 12 influencing
   variables (elevation, slope, curvature, toposhade, aspect, topographic
   wetness index, stream power index, stream density, Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index, soil type, lithology, and rainfall), which were
   compiled from various sources. The database was used to build and verify
   the prediction model. We assessed the model's performance through
   various indices including Classification Accuracy Rate, Area under the
   Curve (AUC), Precision, and Recall. We also compared the model's
   usability with five state-of-the-art machine learning techniques
   including the Backpropagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine,
   and Classification Tree. The results revealed that the hybrid PSO-MARS
   model outperformed other benchmark models in all the employed
   statistical measures. We conclude that the proposed model can be
   particularly suited for flash flood forecasting problems at high
   frequency tropical typhoon area.}},

Title = {{Recent advances in vulnerability assessment for the built environment

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{575}},
Pages = {{587-595}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Irrespective of the magnitude and spatial extend, the consequences of a
   natural hazard are strongly connected to the vulnerability of elements
   at risk (e.g. people, buildings and infrastructure). It is, therefore,
   obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required
   for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability
   assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as
   the socio-economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and
   coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is
   multidimensional (physical, social, economic, etc.), however, the
   dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to
   human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical
   vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in
   small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial
   sediment transport, debris floods, and debris flows. Furthermore, we
   included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential
   catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain
   areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the
   last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of
   buildings towards flash floods, debris flows and hyper-concentrated
   flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and
   approaches may be classified under the following three categories:
   vulnerability matrices, vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices.
   We provide a short review of these methods which became available over
   the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain
   hazard risk management, giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves. The
   approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from
   the European Alps and beyond. Furthermore, challenges in vulnerability
   assessment including data requirements, need for improved event
   documentation, uncertainties and challenges related to future climate
   and socio-economic changes are outlined. Finally, a discussion on
   progress-driving factors such as new technologies (e.g. mobile apps,
   drones), citizen science and new innovative assessment methods is
   provided.}},

Volume = {{575}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The real-time forecasting of urban flooding is a challenging task for
   the following two reasons: (1) urban flooding is often characterized by
   short lead times, (2) the uncertainty in precipitation forecasting is
   usually high. Standard physically based numerical models are often too
   slow for the use in real-time forecasting systems. Data driven models
   have small computational costs and fast computation times and may be
   useful to overcome this problem. The present study presents an
   artificial neural network based model for the prediction of maximum
   water levels during a flash flood event. The challenge of finding a
   suitable structure for the neural network was solved with a new growing
   algorithm. The model is successfully tested for spatially uniformly
   distributed synthetic rain events in two real but slightly modified
   urban catchments with different surface slopes. The computation time of
   the model in the order of seconds and the accuracy of the results are
   convincing, which suggest that the method may be useful for real-time
   forecasts.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of extreme water level return periods in river systems are
   crucial for hydraulic engineering design and planning. Recorded
   historical water level data of Taiwan's rivers are not long enough for
   traditional frequency analyses when predicting extreme water levels for
   different return periods. In this study, the integration of a
   one-dimensional flash flood routing hydrodynamic model with the Monte
   Carlo simulation was used to predict extreme water levels in the
   Danshuei River system of northern Taiwan. The numerical model was
   calibrated and verified with observed water levels using four typhoon
   events. The results indicated a reasonable agreement between the model
   simulation and observation data. Seven parameters, including the
   astronomical tide and surge height at the mouth of the Danshuei River
   and the river discharge at five gauge stations, were adopted to
   calculate the joint probability and generate stochastic scenarios via
   the Monte Carlo simulation. The validated hydrodynamic model driven by
   the stochastic scenarios was then used to simulate extreme water levels
   for further frequency analysis. The design water level was estimated
   using different probability distributions in the frequency analysis at
   five stations. The design high-water levels for a 200-year return period
   at Guandu Bridge, Taipei Bridge, Hsin-Hai Bridge, Da-Zhi Bridge, and
   Chung-Cheng Bridge were 2.90, 5.13, 6.38, 6.05, and 9.94 m,
   respectively. The estimated design water levels plus the free-board are
   proposed and recommended for further engineering design and planning.}},

Abstract = {{Romania is among the European countries which are still susceptible to
   flood disasters. Climate change, the lack of a sustainable land
   management and floods approach are the most important driving factors of
   flood risk. Accordingly, additional research to improve or develop
   various methods for predicting the flash flood events, especially within
   densely populated watersheds, is required. This paper aims to provide a
   further assessment of the reliability of a distributed hydrological
   model developed within a GIS framework The model was developed for use
   in small river basins and so forth, another objective is to provide
   insight into whether it is acceptable for use in larger-sized watersheds
   than the ones it was created for. The methodology is presented by
   computing the discharges at the entrance of six human settlements
   located within the Bistra river watershed, a left-bank tributary of
   Barcau river (Bihor department, Romania). The chosen study area is
   frequently impacted by flooding, endangering the socioeconomic
   activities, human settlements and infrastructure. A distributed
   hydrological modeling approach and the SCS-CN method are used in this
   research. The results revealed a good correlation between the estimated
   and measured hydrographs at the gauging points of Padurea Neagra
   (upstream) and Chiribis (located at the downstream end of the drainage

Abstract = {{Water problems arising from the negative effects of climate change will
   cause serious challenges to cities in the near future. Sudden, heavy
   rainfall in a short time as well as the summer drought periods can be a
   major concern for urban water management systems. In addition to
   overloading the urban sewer system, urban flash floods caused by large
   amounts of precipitation can lead to serious damage in connection with
   surface runoff; furthermore, this significant amount of water is removed
   from the water cycle of the city without utilization (infiltration,
   storage). Various water management and hydrology models, such as
   UFORE-Hydro used in our analyses, can serve as suitable tools for
   investigating these processes. In our research, we examined the role of
   vegetation covered areas in urban water cycle, paying special attention
   to their impact on surface runoff. The results of modeling in Szeged
   sample areas show that vegetation can considerably reduce the volume and
   amplitude of surface runoff. In the scenario studies, vegetation has
   always changed the rate of runoff in a favorable direction, thus our
   findings support the necessity of green infrastructure developments.}},

   Application to a Small Urban Stream in South Korea}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The runoff from heavy rainfall reaches urban streams quickly, causing
   them to rise rapidly. It is therefore of great importance to provide
   sufficient lead time for evacuation planning and decision making. An
   efficient flood forecasting and warning method is crucial for ensuring
   adequate lead time. With this objective, this paper proposes an analysis
   method for a flood forecasting and warning system, and establishes the
   criteria for issuing urban-stream flash flood warnings based on the
   amount of rainfall to allow sufficient lead time. The proposed
   methodology is a nonstructural approach to flood prediction and risk
   reduction. It considers water level fluctuations during a rainfall event
   and estimates the upstream (alert point) and downstream (confluence)
   water levels for water level analysis based on the rainfall intensity
   and duration. We also investigate the rainfall/runoff and flow
   rate/water level relationships using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's
   Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the HEC's River Analysis System
   (HEC-RAS) models, respectively, and estimate the rainfall threshold for
   issuing flash flood warnings depending on the backwater state based on
   actual watershed conditions. We present a methodology for issuing flash

Abstract = {{Floods are still a significant threat to people, despite of the
   considerable developments in forecasting, management, defensive, and
   rescue works. In the near future, climate and societal changes as both
   urbanization of flood prone areas and individual dangerous behaviors
   could increase flood fatalities. This paper analyzes flood mortality in
   eight countries using a 39-year database (1980-2018) named EUFF
   (EUropean Flood Fatalities), which was built using documentary sources.
   The narratives of fatalities were investigated and standardized in the
   database reporting the details of the events. The entire dataset shows a
   stable trend on flood fatalities, despite the existence of individual
   increasing (Greece, Italy, and South France) and decreasing (Turkey and
   Catalonia) trends. The 2466 fatalities were mainly males, aged between
   30-49 years and the majority of them happened outdoor. Most often people
   were dragged by water/mud when travelling by motor vehicles. Some cases
   of hazardous behaviors, such as fording rivers, were also detected. The
   primary cause of death was drowning, followed by heart attack. This work
   contributes to understand the human-flood interaction that caused
   fatalities. The changes in society's vulnerability highlighted
   throughout this study contribute to manage future risks, to improve
   people protection actions, and to reduce risk behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the greatest natural
   threats to life and property in the United States, since they can
   produce multiple hazards associated with convective storms over a wide
   region. Of these hazards, tornadoes within TC rainbands pose a
   particularly difficult forecast problem owing to their rapid evolution
   and their frequent occurrence coincident with additional hazards, such
   as flash flooding and damaging winds. During the 2017 Atlantic hurricane
   season, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma impacted the continental United
   States, causing significant loss of life and billions of dollars in
   property damage. Application of the Warn-on-Forecast (WoF) concept of
   short-term, probabilistic guidance of convective hazards (Stensrud et
   al. 2009, 2013), including the potential for tornadoes within TCs,
   offers the ability to provide forecasters with valuable tools for
   prioritizing the relative risk from multiple convective threats and
   effectively communicating them to the public.}},

Abstract = {{The rainfall threshold assessment of flash floods normally determines
   the rationality of a single warning duration for a disaster prevention
   object, which cannot precisely ascertain the overall reliability of the
   critical rainfall of disaster prevention object. Besides, the complex
   topographic and geomorphological characteristics of hilly areas increase
   the uncertainty of rainfall threshold calculation. This study aims to
   explore the comprehensive assessment and recheck method for rainfall
   threshold of flash floods, primarily considering the impact of disaster
   information. We used the time-interval characteristic rainfall and
   Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate the rationality
   discriminant factor and the weight of warning durations, as well as
   determined the comprehensive rationality index (CRI) and assessed and
   rechecked the overall rationality of the rainfall threshold of disaster
   prevention objects. Then, the time-interval characteristic rainfall
   assessment method was used to validate the rationality of the rainfall
   threshold rechecked value against information from a historical actual
   flash flood. We found that (1) the CRI could effectively distinguish the
   overall rationality of the rainfall threshold of disaster prevention
   objects; (2) the CRI of critical rainfall rechecked value increased by
   about 40\%, and the qualified rate of historical flood verification
   reached 75\%, which corroborated more with the actual situation of the
   study area. Thus, this study elucidates the comprehensive assessment and
   recheck method and enhancing the rainfall threshold rationality
   assessment system, offering a valuable reference for the analysis and
   calculation of early warning indicators of a flash flood.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change impact is felt at a global scale. One of its results is
   the abnormal rain occurrence during monsoon season. In recent years,
   visible changes due to unusual weather events in Pakistan's hydrological
   cycle were observed in the form of intensification of the hydrological
   cycle with changing of precipitation events such as floods and prolonged
   droughts. Hence, abnormal rainfall occurred in regions of southern and
   northern parts of Sindh, like torrential river floods (2010), flash
   floods (2011-2012), unpredictable rainstorms, etc. causing loss of
   lives, damaging infrastructures and crops, structures, and inhabitant
   displacement. In 2011, heavy cumulative precipitation has been recorded
   in the southern Sindh districts and the coastal belt of Badin and the
   LBOD and Kotri surface drainage system achieved their extreme heights.
   Another example of erratic rain occurred from September 8 to September
   13, 2011 and produced an extraordinary discharge of about 14000 cusecs
   against the designed discharge of 4600 cusecs in the LBOD and Kotri
   surface drainage systems overtopping drains from several locations and
   wreaking havoc in the whole area of the southern part of Sindh.}},

   2000-2015}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{38}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Extreme hydrological events such as flash floods are likely to become
   more frequent and extreme because of increasingly extreme weather and
   climate events. Flash floods occur particularly frequently in China and
   cause huge losses to society annually. Consequently, the Chinese
   government significantly increased the investments in comprehensive
   flash flood disaster prevention and mitigation systems. These measures
   (implemented in 2000-2015) played a pivotal role in reducing flash flood
   fatalities. The absolute annual death toll and average fatality rate in
   single torrential rainstorms in 2008-2015 decreased by 40\% and 42\%
   with the massively increased investments compared with those of previous
   years, respectively. However, the efficiency of fiscal investment in
   reducing flash flood fatalities has not been optimal at the national and
   provincial scales in most years. The technical inefficiency of the
   recent eight years was mainly influenced by the scale inefficiency at
   the national scale; by contrast, the technical inefficiency of the most
   recent years depended largely on pure technical efficiency (PTE) on a
   provincial scale. This implies that fiscal investment should be
   allocated more reasonably through dynamic risk assessment at the
   national level, and the selection of prevention measures must place more
   emphasis on rationality and effectiveness in different areas. PTE at a
   regional scale should be increased by solving the limitations of
   existing measures. Hence, rigorous analyses are necessary. The results
   of this study offer a different perspective on flash flood disaster
   prevention systems and can be used to compare flood risk management
   method to those of other countries.}},

   large CAPE, near surface convergence and increased potential vortices in
   the selected area play substantial role in early assessment of the
   atmospheric status, convective instability and storm potential. In
   addition the directional wind shear (veering) at the near surface layer,
   high storm helicity index, differential heating induced by the strong
   local forcing environment serve as triggering factors for initiation of
   supercell storm with rotational updrafts-mesocyclone. The cloud model
   simulation with fine resolution allows more detail insight into the
   storm dynamics and the mechanism of generation of rotational updrafts
   and mesocyclone, a hook echo signature and the presence of bounded weak
   echo region as ingredients for supercellular structure and evolution.
   The overshooting top of 15km, peak updraft speed of 40m/s, wind gust of
   35m/s and reflectivity which exceeds 70 dBZ indicates to the occurrence
   of a very severe storm. A longer live cycle of storm and the intense
   water production, with extreme rainfall rate of 38mm/5min, contribute to
   formation of excessive torrential rainfall and local catastrophic
   flooding.}},

Abstract = {{Region: Ethiopia's Rift Valley.
   Focus: matching agricultural water demand and supply is a growing policy
   challenge in drylands. We investigated the water balance components in
   Raya (3507 km(2)) and Ashenge (80.5 km(2)) grabens. The rainfall depth,
   river discharge, abstraction, climate and soil data (2015-2017) were
   used to address the research question.
   New hydrological insights: the average annual rainfall of the graben's
   escarpment and its bottom was 806 +/- 162 and 508 +/- 110 mm,
   respectively. Heavy rains produce floods up to 732 m(3) s(-1) in the
   rivers that flow into the Raya graben. Moreover, greater runoff and
   river discharges volumes were recorded at the graben escarpments than at
   the graben bottom outlets (p < 0.001) due to the greater contributing
   area (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.98) and headwater elevation (p < 0.001, R-2 =
   0.98). About 24\% of the water entering both graben bottoms comes from
   the runoff from the adjacent slopes, and about 40\% of the runoff
   reaching the Raya graben bottom flowed out at the outlet. About 76\% and
   77.5\% of the annual rainfall was lost through evapotranspiration from
   the Raya and Ashenge grabens, respectively. So about 16\% and 33\% of
   the average annual inflows infiltrated into the sediments in the Raya
   and Ashenge grabens, respectively. These insights provided by this study
   into the water balance in grabens along the Rift Valley can be used to
   help achieve sustainable agricultural development.}},

   origins of air parcels for flash floods in the conterminous United

   and for six regions of interest: the West Coast, Arizona, the Front
   Range of the Rocky Mountains, Flash Flood Alley in south-central Texas,
   the Missouri Valley, and the Appalachians. Parcels were released from
   vertical columns in the atmosphere at times and locations where there
   were reported flash floods; these were traced backward in time for 5
   days. The temporal and seasonal cycles of flood events in these regions
   are also explored. The results show the importance of trajectories
   residing for long periods over oceanic regions such as the Gulf of
   Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The flow is generally unidirectional with
   height in the lower layers of the atmosphere. The trajectory paths from
   oceanic genesis regions to inland hotspots and their orientation with

Abstract = {{Backward trajectories were derived from North American Regional
   Reanalysis data for 19 253 flash flood reports published by the National
   Weather Service to determine the along-path contribution of the land
   surface to the moisture budget for flash flood events in the
   conterminous United States. The impact of land surface interactions was
   evaluated seasonally and for six regions: the West Coast, Arizona, the
   Front Range, Flash Flood Alley, the Missouri Valley, and the
   Appalachians. Parcels were released from locations that were impacted by
   flash floods and traced backward in time for 120 h. The boundary layer
   height was used to determine whether moisture increases occurred within
   the boundary layer or above it. Moisture increases occurring within the
   boundary layer were attributed to evapotranspiration from the land
   surface, and surface properties were recorded from an offline run of the
   Noah land surface model. In general, moisture increases attributed to
   the land surface were associated with anomalously high surface latent
   heat fluxes and anomalously low sensible heat fluxes (resulting in a
   positive anomaly of evaporative fraction) as well as positive anomalies
   in top-layer soil moisture. Over the ocean, uptakes were associated with
   positive anomalies in sea surface temperatures, the magnitude of which
   varies both regionally and seasonally. Major oceanic surface-based
   source regions of moisture for flash floods in the United States include
   the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California, while boundary layer
   moisture increases in the southern plains are attributable in part to
   interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Urban planning is commonly blamed for its failure to exert a positive
   influence on managing climate change impacts in urban Africa; yet little

   Kumasi. Using a review of three relevant urban planning and climate
   change policies of Ghana, and interviews with six urban planning and

   an unclear nature of policies, and a lack of focus on climate change
   issues in urban planning. Evidence of weak agency framework and
   coordination challenges (e.g., logistics, enforcement of laws) were
   reported, a situation that has contributed to the city's inability to
   manage `normal' climate change impacts (e.g., flash floods). The paper
   concludes with proposals for incorporating climate change concerns into

Abstract = {{Karachi, the biggest city of Pakistan, has undergone various urban
   sprawls due to its continuously growing population that has severely
   affected its natural drainage pattern. The city had an extensive natural
   drainage system which has now lost its original form. This study
   investigated the blockages and their causes during the last two decades
   in one of the city's riverbeds-Malir. Moreover, the extent of floods
   identifying the vulnerability of the watershed's urban area after major
   rainfall events was modeled. The geospatial techniques and satellite
   images of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 were used to analyze the changes in land
   use and land cover (LULC) of the Malir Basin. The Shuttle Radar
   Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model and topographic
   sheets of 1975 were utilized to delineate the natural drainage network
   and streambeds of the basin using geographical information system (GIS)
   tools. Historical rainfall data from 1985 to 2014 were acquired from the
   Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) to simulate runoff using the US
   Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS and
   HEC-GeoHMS). The flood modeling was done using the River Analysis System
   (HEC-RAS and GeoRAS). Rainfall-runoff simulations and flood extent and
   depth of five major rainfall events-1992, 2003, 2007, 2009, and
   2013-were modeled in this study. GIS overlay analysis combined the LULC,
   riverbed, and drainage line layers to identify the blocked area and to
   quantify the specific LULCs that were causing blockages in the riverbed.
   Several maps, which are prepared in this study, show the parts of the
   river with altered drainage patterns in 2013 from what existed back in
   1975.}},

Abstract = {{The evaporation loss is a key component that affects managing the water
   resources of arid and semi-arid regions, where the resources are not
   uniformly distributed. Due to the climate condition and the physical
   characteristics of arid regions, a major proportion of precipitation is
   often unavailable through the flash floods, while merely a small
   fraction recharges the groundwater aquifers. Therefore, to achieve
   sustainable development, managing the water resources based on rainwater
   harvesting systems is inevitable. The main aim of this study was to
   assess the reliability of the rainwater harvesting systems designed for
   a future period (2017-2030). Thus, monthly climate data (e.g.,
   precipitation) were simulated by using the outputs of general
   circulation models (GCMs) of the newest generation in the coupled model
   intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) as the first step under two
   representative concentration pathways (RCPs), i.e., RCP2.6 and RCP8.5.
   Then, the data were downscaled spatially through bias-correction spatial
   disaggregation (BCSD) method for 20 grid points surrounding Birjand rain
   gauge station, east of Iran. Monthly precipitation of Birjand rain gauge
   station was interpolated automatically by means of the ordinary Kriging
   method during a future period, between 2017 until 2030. Data
   pre-processing in geostatistical methods, including investigating the
   normality, isotropic, trend analysis, and semi-variogram selection, was
   also carried out automatically through coding in MATLAB. Finally, using
   the interpolated monthly precipitation time series, the reliability of
   the precipitation harvesting systems was assessed for a different range
   of rooftop areas and storage tank capacities. Results indicated that
   this process can meet a significant volume of the household non-potable
   water demand by RWHS. Similar reliability values based on the projected
   monthly precipitation due to two GCMs and two RCPs were extracted for
   future period. The reliability of RWHS acquired by RCP2.6 will not
   widely diverse from RCP8.5. Totally, for semi-arid region, it is
   possible to supply about 20\% of non-potable water demand in the future
   periods. Although this amount seems to be a low value, it should be
   noted that RWHS may prevent extra groundwater withdrawal and thus
   enhance the sustainability of the water resources.}},

Abstract = {{Despite massive flood protection efforts in China, undertaken since the
   ancient times, disastrous floods continue to plague the country. In this
   paper, we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in China.
   First, we review published results (including our own works) on change
   detection in observed records of intense precipitation, high river flow
   and flood damage in China. We provide information on essential features
   of extreme floods in last decades - floods on large rivers, urban
   floods, and flash floods. Next, we review available projections for the
   future (including our own results), related to intense precipitation,
   high river flow and flood damage in China. We try to interpret the
   difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications.
   Since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large, projections
   have to be interpreted with caution, because of the impact on decisions
   related to climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, and water
   resources management. We review flood risk reduction strategies in
   China, focusing on the present situation and division of
   responsibilities. China has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task
   to improve flood preparedness, by both structural ({''}hard{''})
   defences, such as: dikes, dams and flood control reservoirs, and
   diversions, as well as non-structural ({''}soft{''}) measures: spatial
   planning and zoning; watershed management (source control), flood
   forecasting and warning systems; and awareness raising. The strategy of
   flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to
   alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding future changes in hydroclimatic variables plays a crucial
   role in improving resilience and adaptation to extreme weather events
   such as floods and droughts. In this study, we develop high-resolution
   climate projections over Texas by using the convection-permitting
   Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with 4km horizontal grid
   spacing, and then produce the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based
   hydrologic forecasts in the Guadalupe River basin which is the primary
   concern of the Texas Water Development Board and the Guadalupe-Blanco
   River Authority. The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent
   Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset is used to verify the WRF climate
   simulations. The Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) dataset
   is used to validate probabilistic hydrologic predictions. Projected
   changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and
   streamflow at different temporal scales are examined by dynamically
   downscaling climate projections derived from 15 Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models
   (GCMs). Our findings reveal that the Upper Coast Climate Division of
   Texas is projected to experience the most remarkable wetting caused by
   precipitation and PET changes, whereas the most significant drying is
   expected to occur for the North Central Texas Climate Division. The dry
   Guadalupe River basin is projected to become drier with a substantial
   increase in future drought risks, especially for the summer season. And
   the extreme precipitation events are projected to increase in frequency
   and intensity with a reduction in overall precipitation frequency, which
   may result in more frequent occurrences of flash floods and drought
   episodes in the Guadalupe River basin.}},

Abstract = {{St. Vincent and the Grenadines is an archipelagic state of the Caribbean
   that regularly suffers natural disasters; climate change is increasing
   the frequency of intense hurricanes and storms. The southernmost
   watersheds of St. Vincent have a rugged topography that favours
   flash-flooding in rainy events, with great damage because the area
   concentrates most of the country's population and infrastructure. To
   deal with this problem the Government has developed studies, engineering
   works and a watershed management plan. Land use management is an
   effective way of controlling hydrological impacts; the plan divides the
   watersheds in three uses, nature conservation (46\%), agriculture and
   agroforestry (24\%), and urban (30\%), with categories, establishing
   permitted, prohibited and restricted activities. The area is close to
   the limit of urban development; if further expansion were essential it
   should be done by increasing density in lower and flatter areas. Many
   houses, usually low-income settlements, are in flooding or landslide
   risk areas, which should be decolonized, changing land use. It is also
   necessary to avoid hillside arable crops. Adaptation to climate change
   through land use management is essential, although unfortunately less
   socially and politically appreciated than engineering works.}},

Abstract = {{The Genoa Metropolitan Area (GMA) has been historically affected by
   floods for two reasons, namely meteorological conditions and the city's
   geographical arrangement. In the past few years in GMA, an increase in
   flash floods has been registered; among the causes, climate variations
   have been analysed. In 2014, several floods took place. In some areas of
   the hinterland, the cumulative annual rainfall exceeded 4000mm. This
   research analyses the rainfall statistics collected by Genoa University
   and Chiavari stations (GMA along the coast) and at Isoverde and Diga
   Giacopiane stations (hinterland of GMA). The analysis was based on the
   mean annual, seasonal and monthly rainfall and rainy days for the four
   stations and daily series for Genoa University. Furthermore, annual
   maximum data of hourly rainfall for the Pontecarrega station were
   analysed. The annual rainfall does not show any trend. The monthly
   analysis highlights significant decreases for rainfall and rainy days
   between spring and summer. Climate indices recorded on daily data at
   Genoa University station show a certain increase in rainfall intensity
   in recent years. Additionally, hourly rainfall at 1 and 3h increased,
   and the series showed a change point in the 1990s. Furthermore, urban
   sprawl has continually increased until now, and its contribution has
   already been accepted. These facts can be related to the intensification
   of flash flood events measured in the last decade. Furthermore,
   historical data from several sources confirm an increase in the number
   of events and casualties. These conditions determine a clear need for
   monitoring potentially hazard situations.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of porous pavement (PP) and bio-retention cells (BCs)
   under the influence of potential climate change was investigated based
   on representative concentration pathways (RCPs). A case study of a test
   catchment in Guangzhou illustrated changes of peak runoff under various
   climate scenarios. There were distinct increases in runoff volume and
   peak discharge in response to RCP8.5 but only marginal increases in
   response to RCP2.6 (compared with present conditions). The performance
   of PP and BCs in terms of percentage reduction of runoff volume and peak
   discharge was examined for 1-, 10-, and 100-year return period and 1-
   and 6-h-duration storms under various climate scenarios. The
   effectiveness of PP and BCs varied non-linearly with the extent of PP
   and BCs adopted. In general, the fluctuation of hydrological performance
   of PP is greater than that of BCs in RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (e.g., peak flow
   reductions range from - 60\% to 69\% and from - 22\% to 9\%, for 5\%
   area of PP and BCs, respectively). And PP is more cost-effective for
   frequent storms using life cycle costing analysis. We find that PP and
   BCs could significantly reduce runoff volume and peak discharge in
   response to rainfall events with short return period, but not for heavy
   storms with longer return period.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood is a typical natural hazard that occurs within a short time
   with high flow velocities and is difficult to predict. In this study, we
   propose and validate a new soft computing approach that is an
   integration of an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO), named as PSO-ELM, for the spatial prediction of
   flash floods. The ELM is used to generate the initial flood model,
   whereas the PSO was employed to optimize the model. A high frequency
   tropical typhoon area at Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case
   study. In this regard, a geospatial database for the study area was
   constructed with 654 flash flood locations and 12 influencing factors
   (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, toposhade, topographic wetness
   index, stream power index, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology,
   and rainfall). The model performance was validated using several
   evaluators such as kappa statistics, root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean
   absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and area under
   the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) and compared to three state-of-the-art machine
   learning techniques, including multilayer perceptron neural networks,
   support vector machine, and C4.5 decision tree. The results revealed
   that the PSO-ELM model has high prediction performance (kappa statistics
   = 0.801, RMSE = 0.281; MAE = 0.079, R-2 = 0.829, AUC-ROC = 0.954) and
   successfully outperformed the three machine learning models. We conclude
   that the proposed model is a new tool for the prediction of flash flood
   susceptibility at high frequency tropical typhoon areas.}},

Abstract = {{A synthetic storm generator-Dynamic Moving Storm (DMS)-is developed in
   this study to represent spatio-temporal variabilities of rainfall and
   storm movement in synthetic storms. Using an urban watershed as the
   testbed, the authors investigate the hydrologic responses to the DMS
   parameters and their interactions. In order to reveal the complex nature
   of rainfall-run-off processes, previously simplified assumptions are
   relaxed in this study regarding (a) temporal variability of rainfall
   intensity and (b) time-invariant flow velocity in channel routing. The
   results of this study demonstrate the significant contribution of storm
   moving velocity to the variation of peak discharge based on a global
   sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, a pairwise sensitivity analysis is
   conducted to elucidate not only the patterns in individual contributions
   from parameters to hydrologic responses but also their interactions with
   storm moving velocity. The intricacies of peak discharges resulting from
   sensitivity analyses are then dissected into independent hydrologic
   metrics, that is, run-off volume and standard deviation of run-off
   timings, for deeper insights. It is confirmed that peak discharge is
   increased when storms travel downstream along the main channel at the
   speed that corresponds to a temporal superposition of run-off. Spatial
   concentration of catchment rainfall is found to be a critical linkage
   through which characteristics of moving storms affect peak discharges.
   In addition, altering peak timing of rainfall intensity in conjunction
   with storm movement results in varied storm core locations in the
   channel network, which further changes the flow attenuation effects from
   channel routing. For future directions, the DMS generator will be
   embedded in a stochastic modelling framework and applied in
   rainfall/flow frequency analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Rising salinity is a severe problem associated with land degradation in
   arid and semiarid regions. This study seeks to understand the
   spatiotemporal patterns of water salinity and their implication on the
   downstream water availability in the marginal grabens of northern
   Ethiopia. We measured the electrical conductivity (EC) of flash floods,
   baseflows, springs, wells, and lakes. A total of 1,168 samples was
   collected from 177 spatially distributed water sources (2016-2017). This
   study shows that there was a significant difference in the EC values of
   the water points between rainy (1,403 +/- 425 mu S cm(-1)) and dry
   seasons (2,261 +/- 258 mu S cm(-1)). Besides, there is an inverse
   relationship between the river discharges and the runoff EC in the study
   area. The average value of the water EC was also higher in the limestone
   area than in the basalt sites. In addition, the water EC increased from
   the escarpments (396 +/- 176 mu S cm(-1)) towards the outlets of the
   graben basins (1,670 +/- 942 mu S cm(-1)). These water EC hotspots in
   the dry season imply that the river basins are in a closing status due
   to the erratic rainfall and water extraction by humans. However, the
   rising water EC and moisture stress endanger the existing agricultural
   development. Because of the extent and seriousness of salinity,
   integrated catchment management strategies are needed to tackle the
   degrading water quality and quantity in the marginal grabens along the
   northern Ethiopia Rift Valley.}},

Abstract = {{Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) structure is widely used to expand
   groundwater resources. In arid regions with flash flooding, MAR can also
   be used as a flood control structure to decrease peak discharge of
   rivers. In this paper, we present a method for quantifying the role of
   MAR in head water systems and assess its impact on the total water
   balance in a river basin. The method is based on rainfall-runoff
   modeling, reservoir flood routing, recharge analysis and river flow
   analysis. For the case selected, Kamal Abad MAR in Lake Maharlou basin
   in southern Iran, we analyzed changes in the downstream river regime
   using two scenarios (with MAR and without MAR) with different return
   periods. The results revealed a significant impact of MAR on river flow
   in terms of changes in flow timing, magnitude and variability. With MAR,
   the ephemeral river studied became disconnected from the main stream,
   albeit, whereas the case without MAR, floods with return period higher
   than 10 years would be connected to the downstream. Even though, MAR
   structures are useful in arid and semi-arid climates for irrigation
   water supply, their placing and designing need more attention. The
   developed method can be used to assess the impacts of MAR on river flow
   and find the best location for it to make the connection of the
   ephemeral river and downstream river, an issue which has not received
   much attention in hydrological research. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Performance evaluation of WRF for extreme flood forecasts in a coastal

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{223}},
Pages = {{39-48}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Increasing incidences of flash floods highlight the need for a reliable
   flood forecasting system to minimize the losses of lives and property.
   The most formidable challenge of flood forecasting is the availability
   of high resolution and accurate precipitation forecast despite having a
   sophisticated 3-ways flood hydrodynamic model. Global rainfall
   forecasting products are of coarse resolution, which makes them less
   reliable for urban flood forecasting. Therefore, high-resolution
   regional weather forecasting models such as the Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model are used to generate fine-scale rainfall
   estimates. Precipitation forecasting from the WRF model is highly
   dependent on model configuration, especially cumulus (CU)
   parameterization and microphysics (MP) schemes. In the present study,
   three physics schemes that include two urban, four CU and three MP
   schemes of WRF model are investigated for extreme precipitation
   estimates. The six events comprised of two of the highest rainfall
   events of the years 2012, 2013 and 2014 have been selected for
   investigation over Mumbai, India. The events are simulated using initial
   and boundary conditions from the ERA-Interim Reanalysis dataset. The
   simulated rainfall events are evaluated against the observations from 28
   automatic weather stations over Mumbai. The analysis suggests that
   building environment parameterization (BEP) scheme influences the
   spatial pattern of the rainfall along with the reduction in rainfall
   bias. Further, CU schemes affect the magnitude of the rainfall while MP
   schemes have a lesser impact than the former. WRF simulations with BEP
   urban scheme, Grell-Devenyi 3D CU, and Lin MP scheme performs best (out
   of selected combinations). Besides, the best performing scheme has been
   tested with initial and boundary conditions from the global forecasting
   system (GFS) for the same events; the results have shown improved
   rainfall estimates than the GFS forecasts.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, flash floods took place in various parts of the country
   that are not under floodplains due to high rainfall events, causing
   damage to rail, road and urban infrastructure. There is a need to
   develop a flood vulnerable index map of the country for precautionary
   measures in such vulnerable areas. Developing flood vulnerability index
   (FVI) at country level in India is a multifaceted job due to huge
   variations in topographic, meteorological and hydrological conditions
   over space and time. The paper focuses on developing a scientific
   approach in preparing FVI map of the country in a spatial decision
   support system environment by using space-based inputs, topographic data
   and long-term meteorological data. Probable maximum precipitation (PMP)
   and high rainfall frequency were computed using 100 years daily rainfall
   data of the country. Runoff potential of the country was prepared using
   high resolution landuse, soils, and digital elevation model grids.
   Probable maximum run-off was further computed at national level using
   PMP and run-off potential grids. Morphometric analysis was done using
   topographic and drainage information. All these layers were normalized
   and integrated in SDSS environment to compute the flood vulnerability
   index of the country. Suitable weights were given for all layers using
   the knowledge base reviewed across the globe. Sensitivity analysis and
   validation were done using the previous flood incidents.}},

Abstract = {{To study key processes of the water cycle, two special observation
   periods (SOPs) of the Hydrological cycle in the Mediterranean experiment
   (HyMeX) took place during autumn 2012 and winter 2013. The first SOP
   aimed to study high precipitation systems and flash flooding in the
   Mediterranean area. The AROME-WMED (western Mediterranean) model
   (Fourrie et al., 2015) is a dedicated version of the mesoscale Numerical
   Weather Prediction (NWP) AROME-France model, which covers the western
   Mediterranean basin providing the HyMeX operational center with daily
   real-time analyses and forecasts. These products allowed for adequate
   decision-making for the field campaign observation deployment and the
   instrument operation. Shortly after the end of the campaign, a first
   reanalysis with more observations was performed with the first SOP
   operational software. An ensuing comprehensive second reanalysis of the
   first SOP, which included field research observations (not assimilated
   in real time) and some reprocessed observation datasets, was made with
   AROME-WMED. Moreover, a more recent version of the AROME model was used
   with updated background error statistics for the assimilation process.
   This paper depicts the main differences between the real-time version
   and the benefits brought by HyMeX reanalyses with AROME-WMED. The first
   reanalysis used 9\% additional data and the second one 24\% more
   compared to the real-time version. The second reanalysis is found to be
   closer to observations than the previous AROME-WMED analyses. The second
   reanalysis forecast errors of surface parameters are reduced up to the
   18 and 24 h forecast range. In the middle and upper troposphere, fields
   are also improved up to the 48 h forecast range when compared to
   radiosondes. Integrated water vapor comparisons indicate a positive
   benefit for at least 24 h. Precipitation forecasts are found to be
   improved with the second reanalysis for a threshold up to 10 mm(24 h) 1.
   For higher thresholds, the frequency bias is degraded. Finally,
   improvement brought by the second reanalysis is illustrated with the
   Intensive Observation Period (IOP8) associated with heavy precipitation
   over eastern Spain and southern France.}},

   provide very short-term probabilistic model guidance products that will
   aid the ability of National Weather Service forecasters to issue
   probabilistic warnings of severe convective hazards with higher accuracy
   and longer lead times. The experimental Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS),
   which is under development, is a frequently cycled, regional,
   convective-scale, on-demand, ensemble data assimilation and prediction
   system. The system assimilates thunderstorm observations to forecast the
   life cycle and associated hazards of individual convective storms. Most
   of the initial research effort, since the beginning of the WoF project
   in 2009, has been focused on tornadic events, which constitute one of
   the most violent and difficult to predict weather threats. However, the
   system emerging from this project has significant potential to help with
   prediction of other hazards as well: in particular,
   flash-flood-producing, convectively driven intense rainfall events. This
   study focuses on the application of WoFS in 0-6-hr probabilistic
   rainfall forecasts of several flash-flood-producing heavy rainfall
   events during the spring and summer of 2015 and 2016. Results indicate
   that WoFS successfully initializes the convective storms in the
   ensemble. Visual inspections and probabilistic verification metrics show
   that WoFS predicts the intense rainfall that often leads to flash
   flooding at the correct location with higher accuracy in areal coverage
   and amount during the 0-3 hr forecast period than during the later 3-6
   hr period. Overall results indicate that the frequently updated 0-6-hr
   ensemble forecast from the WoFS has the potential to highlight areas
   where intense rainfall can result in flash flooding and increase
   near-term situational awareness of flash flood threats.}},

Abstract = {{Population dynamics of early and late temporal forms of pink salmon
   Oncorhynchus gorbuscha on the Iturup and Kunashir islands (southern
   Kuril Islands) and on the southeastern coast of Sakhalin in 1991-2017 is
   considered. The periods of the increase and decrease in the abundance of
   pink salmon in odd and even years occurred simultaneously. However, the
   duration of periods with high abundance of the early form was shorter.
   The sharp decrease in the abundance of each of the temporal forms was
   often due to the effect of extreme environmental factors (flash floods
   in rivers that wash out the soil on spawning grounds or storms in the
   coastal zone during the feeding period of juveniles that had recently
   migrated downstream from the rivers); however, the causes remained
   unclear in some cases. The abundance of the early form tends to decrease
   more intensively or one to two generations earlier than the reduction of
   the more numerous late form; therefore, the emergence of depression
   signs in the early form may indicate the coming general depression of
   pink salmon stocks in the area under study.}},

Abstract = {{During the extreme precipitation event of 15th-17th June 2013 in Garhwal
   Himalaya, glacial lake outburst flooding accompanied by numerous
   landslides and flash flood events caused widespread death and
   destruction. Many hill slopes and steep river banks had developed
   fractures and fissures indicative of landslides and one such scarp was
   observed at Kunjethi (Kalimath) village on satellite images during
   routine analysis. Rainfall threshold analysis for years 2012, 2013, 2014
   and 2015 has confirmed that it was the main triggering factor which
   happened due to extreme precipitation in June 2013 leading to scarp
   development and initiation of landslide. In order to characterize the
   landslide and get subsurface information, two highly cost-effective and
   fast non-invasive geophysical techniques, electrical resistivity
   tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR), were used. Four ERT
   profiles and one GPR radargram profile were used to determine the
   approximate depth to slip surface, which is inferred around 15-19 m.
   Integration of satellite remote sensing, geophysical studies and field
   observations have been used to demarcate the maximum possible slide
   zone. This study reiterates that earth observation tools in integration
   with faster, non-invasive and cost-effective geophysical techniques can
   establish the slip surface, which is an essential information required
   for landslide hazard mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Intense rainfall events lead to floods and landslides in the Western
   Himalayas (WH). These rainfall amounts are considered comparatively
   moderate over the plains. These events, called `cloudbursts,' are
   convective triggered followed by orographically locked phenomena
   producing sudden high-intensity rainfall over a small area. Early
   warning and prediction of such severe local weather systems is important
   to mitigate societal impacts arising from the accompanying flash floods,
   landslides, etc. Due to lack of ground-based observations, cloudbursts
   over remote and unpopulated hilly areas often go unreported. Present
   study examines a cloudburst occurred at Ladakh (Leh) in the WH in the
   early hours of August 5, 2010, using remotely sensed rainfall data from
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Kalpana-1. The storm
   lasted for 2 days starting from August 3, 2010, followed by flash
   floods. Rain-band propagation over the region is studied from Kalpana-1
   3-hourly rainfall estimates using Indian Satellite (INSAT)
   multi-spectral rainfall algorithm (IMSRA) and TRMM rainfall estimates
   using TRMM 3B42 algorithm. Quantitative and qualitative assessment and
   comparison of these two products is made. It is observed that there is
   decrease in satellite brightness temperature (BT) during the rainfall
   event. Initiation of rainfall occurs at about < 255 K. Maximum of 16.75
   mm/h rainfall is observed over the Jammu and Kashmir at 21 GMT from TRMM
   3B42 estimates. In addition, it is observed that Kalpana-1 IMSRA
   underestimates the rainfall observations with respect to Indian
   Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall estimates. Spatial correlation
   at 5\% significant level is evaluated, and similarities in rainfall
   estimates based on rainfall retrieval algorithms are made during the
   cloudburst event. Mean and standard deviations depict that TRMM 3B42 and
   IMD rainfall estimates are closer in terms of spatial signature, but
   estimates of rainfall from Kalpana-1 underestimate the mean and standard
   deviation signature. In view of orographic contribution, it has been
   observed that linear fit is the better than nonlinear with less rainfall
   bias at 90\% confidence bound over the region.}},

Abstract = {{We propose in this article a regional study of
   intensity-duration-area-frequency (IDAF) relationships of annual
   rainfall maxima in southern France. For this we develop a regional
   extreme value IDAF model based on space-time scale invariance
   hypotheses. The model allows us to link the statistical distributions of
   rainfall maxima over any duration and area. It provides in particular an
   analytical expression of the areal reduction factor, which expresses how
   the statistical distribution of rainfall maxima changes as the area
   increases, for any fixed duration. It also provides an analytical
   expression of areal return level for the continuum of area and duration.
   The model is applied to radar reanalysis data covering a 13,000-km(2)
   region of southern France featuring contrasted rainfall regimes
   (2008-2015). We estimate the IDAF relationships centered on any radar
   pixel of the region in the range 3-48 hr and 1-2,025 km(2). We obtain in
   particular a spatial distribution of the areal reduction factor, which
   allows us to distinguish different rainfall regimes in the region. The
   overall IDAF model provides also a regional quantification of areal
   rainfall risk by allowing the computation of rainfall return level maps
   for any area and duration in the applicable range. Despite inevitable
   sampling issues due to the shortness of the data sample, we highlight
   important differences in the spatial distribution of areal rainfall risk
   depending on the area and duration, illustrating that a comprehensive
   storm risk evaluation should consider the continuum of area and duration
   rather than arbitrarily predefined ones.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) remains a key area of
   uncertainty in hydrological modeling and prediction, particularly in
   small, urban watersheds, which respond rapidly to precipitation and can
   experience significant spatial variability in rainfall fields. Few
   studies have compared QPE methods in small, urban watersheds, and
   studies that have examined this topic only compared model results on an
   event basis using a small number of storms. This study sought to compare
   the efficacy of multiple QPE methods when simulating discharge in a
   small, urban watershed on a continuous basis using an operational
   hydrologic model and QPE forcings. The research distributed hydrologic
   model (RDHM) was used to model a basin in Roanoke, Virginia, USA, forced
   with QPEs from four methods: mean field bias (MFB) correction of radar
   data, kriging of rain gauge data, uncorrected radar data, and a
   basin-uniform estimate from a single gauge inside the watershed. Based
   on comparisons between simulated and observed discharge at the basin
   outlet for a six-month period in 2018, simulations forced with the
   uncorrected radar QPE had the highest accuracy, as measured by root mean
   squared error (RMSE) and peak flow relative error, despite systematic
   underprediction of the mean areal precipitation (MAP). Simulations
   forced with MFB-corrected radar data consistently and significantly
   overpredicted discharge, but had the highest accuracy in predicting the

Title = {{Flash Flood Forecasting Using Support Vector Regression Model in a Small
   Mountainous Catchment}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Flash floods in mountainous catchments are often caused by the
   rainstorm, which may result in more severe consequences than plain area
   floods due to less timescale and a fast-flowing front of water and
   debris. Flash flood forecasting is a huge challenge for hydrologists and
   managers due to its instantaneity, nonlinearity, and dependency. Among
   different methods of flood forecasting, data-driven models have become
   increasingly popular in recent years due to their strong ability to
   simulate nonlinear hydrological processes. This study proposed a Support
   Vector Regression (SVR) model, which is a powerful artificial
   intelligence-based model originated from statistical learning theory, to
   forecast flash floods at different lead times in a small mountainous
   catchment. The lagged average rainfall and runoff are identified as
   model input variables, and the time lags associated with the model input
   variables are determined by the hydrological concept of the time of
   response. There are 69 flash flood events collected from 1984 to 2012 in
   a mountainous catchment in China and then used for the model training
   and testing. The contribution of the runoff variables to the predictions
   and the phase lag of model outputs are analyzed. The results show that:
   (i) the SVR model has satisfactory predictive performances for one to
   three-hours ahead forecasting; (ii) the lagged runoff variables have a
   more significant effect on the predictions than the rainfall variables;
   and (iii) the phase lag (time difference) of prediction results
   significantly exists in both two- and three-hours-ahead forecasting
   models, however, the input rainfall information can assist in mitigating
   the phase lag of peak flow.}},

   Farmers of Haor Areas after a Flash Flood in Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bangladesh remains one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to
   the effects of climate change. Given the reliance of a large segment of
   the population on the agricultural sector for both their livelihoods as
   well as national food security, climate change adaptation in the
   agricultural sector is crucial for continued national food security and
   economic growth. Using household data from lowland rice farmers of
   selected haor areas in Sylhet, the current work presents an analysis of
   the determinants behind the implementation of different climate change
   adaptation strategies by lowland rice farmers. The first objective of
   this study was to explore the extent of awareness of climate change
   within this population as well as the type of opinions held by lowland
   rice farmers with respect to climate change. To serve this purpose, a
   severity index (SI) was developed and subsequently employed to evaluate
   the perceptions and attitudes of 378 farmers with respect to climate
   change vulnerability. Respondents were interviewed with respect to
   climate change related circumstances they faced in their daily lives.
   Attained SI index values ranged from 69.18\% to 93.52\%. The SI for the
   perception ``Climate change affects rice production{''} was measured as
   93.52\%. Using data collected from the same 378 farmers, a logistic
   regression was carried out to investigate the impact of socio-economic
   and institutional factors on adaptation. The results show that credit
   from non-government organizations is highly statistically significant
   for adaptation, and that rural market structure also has a positive
   effect on adaptation. Among the studied factors, credit from
   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) was found to be the most important
   factor for adaptation. The results of this work further indicate that
   marginal farmers would benefit from government (GoB) funded seasonal
   training activities that cover pertinent information regarding
   adaptation after flash floods. Additionally, the authors of this piece
   recommend timely issuance of government-assisted credit during early
   flash floods to afflicted farmers, as such an initiative can aid farmers
   in adapting different strategies to mitigate losses and enhance their
   productivity as well as livelihood.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are one of the natural disasters that threaten the lives of
   many people all over the world every year. Flash floods are
   significantly affected by the intensification of extreme climate events
   and interactions with exposed and vulnerable socio-economic systems
   impede regional development processes. Hence, it is important to
   estimate the loss due to flash floods before the disaster occurs.
   However, there are no comprehensive vulnerability assessment results for
   flash floods in China. Fortunately, the National Mountain Flood Disaster
   Investigation Project provided a foundation to develop this proposed
   assessment. In this study, an index system was established from the
   exposure and disaster reduction capability categories, and is based on
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods. We evaluated flash flood
   vulnerability by adopting the support vector machine (SVM) model. Our
   results showed 439 counties with high and extremely high vulnerability
   (accounting for 10.5\% of the land area and corresponding to
   approximately 100 million hectares (ha)), 571 counties with moderate
   vulnerability (accounting for 19.18\% of the land area and corresponding
   to approximately 180 million ha), and 1128 counties with low and
   extremely low vulnerability (accounting for 39.43\% of the land area and
   corresponding to approximately 370 million ha). The highly-vulnerable
   counties were mainly concentrated in the south and southeast regions of
   China, moderately-vulnerable counties were primarily concentrated in the
   central, northern, and southwestern regions of China, and
   low-vulnerability counties chiefly occurred in the northwest regions of
   China. Additionally, the results of the spatial autocorrelation
   suggested that the ``High-High{''} values of spatial agglomeration areas
   mainly occurred in the Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi,
   Chongqing, and Beijing areas. On the basis of these results, our study
   can be used as a proposal for population and building distribution
   readjustments, and the management of flash floods in China.}},

Abstract = {{Flash-floods are among the natural risk phenomena that annually cause
   important material damages and losses of human lives worldwide. One of
   the main activities for mitigating the negative effects of these
   phenomena consist of the identification and spatial representation of
   the surfaces prone to surface runoff occurrence. Flash-Flood Potential
   Index (FFPI) is the common method used to assess the degree of
   susceptibility to flash-floods of a certain surface. The main drawback
   of the aforementioned method is represented by the fact that, in the
   majority of the studies, the geographical factors considered for FFPI
   calculation received equal weights, even if they do not influence in the
   same measure the surface runoff process. Moreover, within the
   methodologies developed in the previous studies, the areas affected by
   torrential phenomena have not been considered for FFPI computation. To
   address these shortcomings, in the present study, FFPI values are
   estimated by using a number of 4 stand-alone models (Alternating
   Decision Tree (ADT), Rotation Forest, Weights of Evidence (WOE),
   Logistic Model Tree) and 3 hybrid models generated by the integration of
   WOE model with each of the other decision tree-based algorithms. The
   first stage of the study consisted of the inventory of the areas where
   torrential phenomena occurred in the past, 70\% of them being included
   in the training sample, while the others 30\% in the validating sample.
   Further, 12 flash-flood conditioning factors, selected through the
   correlation-based feature selection algorithm, were used to train the 7
   models applied for FFPI calculation. The results of the 7 models
   revealed that the surfaces with a high and very high flash-flood
   susceptibility occupy between 23.3 and 43.7\% of the entire study zone.
   The ROC Curve method was involved in the models performance assessment
   and in the results validation procedure. From this point of view, the
   best results were obtained by the ADT-WOE hybrid model.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flooding in the arid/semiarid southwestern United States is
   frequently associated with convective rainfall during the North American
   monsoon. In this study, we examine flood-producing storms in central
   Arizona based on analyses of dense rain gauge observations and stream
   gauging records as well as North American Regional Reanalysis fields.
   Our storm catalog consists of 102 storm events during the period of
   1988-2014. Synoptic conditions for flood-producing storms are
   characterized based on principal component analyses. Four dominant
   synoptic modes are identified, with the first two modes explaining
   approximately 50\% of the variance of the 500-hPa geopotential height.
   The transitional synoptic pattern from the North American monsoon regime
   to midlatitude systems is a critical large-scale feature for extreme
   rainfall and flooding in central Arizona. Contrasting spatial rainfall
   organizations and storm environment under the four synoptic modes
   highlights the role of interactions among synoptic conditions, mesoscale
   processes, and complex terrains in determining space-time variability of
   convective activities and flash flood hazards in central Arizona. We
   characterize structure and evolution properties of flood-producing
   storms based on storm tracking algorithms and 3D radar reflectivity.
   Fast-moving storm elements can be important ingredients for flash floods
   in the arid/semiarid southwestern United States. Contrasting storm
   properties for cloudburst storms highlight the wide spectrum of
   convective intensities for extreme rain rates in the arid/semiarid
   southwestern United States and exhibit comparable vertical structures to
   their counterparts in the eastern United States.}},

Title = {{The Role of Hazard and Vulnerability in Modulating Economic Damages of
   Inland Floods in the United States Using a Survey-Based Dataset}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the trends in economic damages caused by three
   types of inland floods (flash flood, flood, and heavy rain) in the
   United States and the variations in related hazard and vulnerability
   indicators between 1996 and 2016. We explore the underlying mechanisms
   based on a survey-based dataset maintained by the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service. An annual
   average of 6518 flood occurrences was reported, which caused economic
   damages of 3351 million USD per year. Flash flood and flood contributed
   to 53\% and 32\% of total occurrences and was associated with a larger
   share of damaging events (SDE). Results show that the higher impacts by
   flood and flash flood on property and crop are partly attributed to the
   greater intensity of rainfall. In addition, flood has the highest unit
   cost of damages. Notably, despite an upward tendency in economic damages
   by flash floods, no evident change trend is observed for inland floods
   as a whole. Further analysis shows changes in economic damages by heavy
   rain and flash flood are mainly governed by the increased annual
   frequency and hazard intensity, but the change of trend in their
   vulnerability indicators (i.e., SDE and Damage Per Event (DPE)) is not
   obvious. Regarding floods, it was not possible to attribute the
   variations in economic losses to hazard and vulnerability, as no
   significant tendency is found except for an increasing SDE. Despite
   limitations of length of records, data collection, and methodology, the
   difference in economic impacts and the related hazard and vulnerability
   revealed in this study can help better target future adaptation and
   mitigation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Recent and future changes in precipitation extremes over Portugal were
   studied. Trends in selected precipitation indices were calculated on a
   seasonal scale for the period of 1950-2003. Considering the same
   indices, this study also assessed possible changes under future climatic
   conditions (2046-2065). Furthermore, trends and projections for the
   future were evaluated using a single/unified index of extreme
   precipitation susceptibility (EPSI). The results revealed statistically
   significant drying trends in spring, mainly in northern and central
   Portugal, while weak wetting trends were detected in autumn. The EPSI
   trends also depicted a decrease of extreme precipitation in spring over
   central Portugal and a slight increase in autumn over northern Portugal
   and nearby Lisbon. On the other hand, climate change projections
   revealed a decrease in precipitation, mainly over northwestern Portugal,
   whereas the contribution of extreme precipitation to total precipitation
   is expected to increase, mostly in southern Portugal. The maximum number
   of consecutive dry days (CDD) is also projected to increase throughout
   Portugal. EPSI showed enhanced susceptibility for most Portuguese
   municipalities, which may be associated with increased vulnerability to
   flash floods. Climate change projections by municipality for both EPSI
   and CDD are an important decision support tool for civil protection and
   for risk management in Portugal.}},

Abstract = {{The typical complex orography of the Mediterranean coastal areas support
   the formation of the so-called back-building mesoscale convective
   systems (MCS) producing torrential rainfall often resulting in flash
   floods. As these events are usually very small-scaled and localized,
   they are hardly predictable from a hydrometeorological standpoint,
   frequently causing a significant amount of fatalities and socioeconomic
   damage. Liguria, a northwestern Italian region, is characterized by
   small catchments with very short hydrological response time and is thus
   extremely prone to the impacts of back-building MCSs. Indeed, Liguria
   has been hit by three intense back-building MCSs between 2011 and 2014,
   causing a total death toll of 20 people and several hundred millions of
   euros of damages. Consequently, it is necessary to use
   hydrometeorological forecasting frameworks coupling the finescale
   numerical weather prediction (NWP) outputs with rainfall-runoff models
   to provide timely and accurate streamflow forecasts. Concerning the
   aforementioned back-building MCS episodes that recently occurred in
   Liguria, this work assesses the predictive capability of a
   hydrometeorological forecasting framework composed by a kilometer-scale
   cloud-resolving NWP model (WRF), including a 6-h cycling 3DVAR
   assimilation of radar reflectivity and conventional weather stations
   data, a rainfall downscaling model {[}Rainfall Filtered Autoregressive
   Model (RainFARM)], and a fully distributed hydrological model
   (Continuum). A rich portfolio of WRF 3DVAR direct and indirect
   reflectivity operators has been explored to drive the meteorological
   component of the proposed forecasting framework. The results confirm the
   importance of rapidly refreshing and data intensive 3DVAR for improving
   the quantitative precipitation forecast, and, subsequently, the flash
   flood prediction in cases of back-building MCS events.}},

Abstract = {{Catchment-scale hydrological studies on drylands are lacking because of
   the scarcity of consistent data: observations are often available at the
   plot scale, but their relevance for the catchment scale remains unclear.
   A database of 24 years of stream gauge discharge and homogeneous
   high-resolution radar data over the eastern Mediterranean allows us to
   describe the properties of floods over catchments spanning from desert
   to Mediterranean climates, and we note that the data set is mostly of
   moderate intensity floods. Comparing two climatic regions, desert and
   Mediterranean, we can better identify specific rainfall-runoff
   properties. Despite the large differences in rainfall forcing between
   the two regions, the resulting unit peak discharges and runoff
   coefficients are comparable. Rain depth and antecedent conditions are
   the most important properties to shape flood response in Mediterranean
   areas. In deserts, instead, storm core properties display a strong
   correlation with unit peak discharge and, to a lesser extent, with
   runoff coefficient. In this region, an inverse correlation with mean
   catchment annual precipitation suggests also a strong influence of local
   surface properties. Preliminary analyses suggest that floods in
   catchments with wet headwater and dry lower section are more similar to
   desert catchments, with a strong influence of storm core properties on
   runoff generation.}},

   utilization-a short review}},
Journal = {{COGENT ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, fossil fuels replacements have shown leaps
   and bounds of progressions. Hence, various nations have initiated the
   adoption of biomass energy, solar energy, wind energy and hydropower
   energy. Yet, these currently developing technologies have constantly
   faced dual pressure from both the economic growth and environmental
   protection. Hydropower has become a key candidate for considerable
   utilization in various countries due to its numerous social, economic
   and environmental benefits. In this paper, a short review was carried
   out to analyse the development of various hydropower plants and compare
   its utilization over the conventional fossil fuels. The main setback for
   the adoption of this technology is that large hydropower plant demands
   for huge deforestation. This would direly result in the destruction of
   critical ecosystems, migration of large population at downstream and
   other catastrophic outcomes such as flash floods and landslides.
   However, this singular setback could be alleviated with the utilization
   of small or micro hydropower plant. This technology, in particular, was
   found to have minimal destruction effects to the environment and is able
   to produce affordable energy to the rural areas as it has proven in many
   countries.}},

Title = {{A New Metric to Diagnose Precipitation Distribution in Transitioning

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{61-77}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{A new coupled dynamic and thermodynamic metric is developed based on the
   Eady Moist Baroclinic Growth Rate (EMBGR), to discriminate between
   left-of-track (LOT) and right-of-track (ROT) precipitation distributions
   in transitioning tropical cyclones (TCs). LOT events pose a major flood
   risk even when a TC tracks along a coastline or just offshore, as flash
   flooding can occur hundreds of kilometers inland from the cyclone
   center. The EMBGR can improve human-produced quantitative precipitation
   forecasts (QPF) because it is dependent on relatively well-forecast
   large-scale mass fields. The ability of the EMBGR to identify
   precipitation distribution is first explored in a case study of TC
   Matthew (2016), using reanalysis and numerical model forecasts.
   Subsequently, a composite analysis of 36 years (1979-2014) of United
   States landfalling TCs using reanalysis data shows that the EMBGR is an
   effective discriminator between LOT and ROT distributions. The utility
   of the EMBGR is quantified using a pattern correlation analysis for both
   TC Matthew and the composites. Finally, a conceptual schematic is
   developed for LOT cases so that forecasters can most effectively utilize
   the EMBGR to improve human QPF skill during transitioning TCs.}},

Title = {{Channel control works and sediment connectivity in the European Alps}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{668}},
Pages = {{389-399}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{The need for reducing erosion and sediment transport. and protecting
   human settlements has urged the construction of channel control works in
   mountain streams. Such works include different structures, the check
   dams being probably the most widespread and archetypical. The
   performance of channel control works in mountain streams has usually
   been evaluated based on their effectiveness in stabilizing the channels
   and the adjacent hillslopes, and in retaining sediment. The widespread
   presence of channel control works in mountain streams of various
   regions, however, has also a significant impact on hillslope-channel
   coupling and on sediment transfer across the channel system. Taking into
   account the impact of channel control works on sediment connectivity at
   the catchment scale has remarkable importance for planning new control
   structures and managing the existing ones and, more in general, for
   sediment management in mountain catchments. In this paper, we consider
   the channel control works within the conceptual framework of sediment
   connectivity and related terminology, and we analyze the spatial and
   temporal scales of the interactions between channel control works and
   sediment coupling-decoupling. Some examples from the Italian Alps
   outline the impact of check dams and other hydraulic structures on
   sediment connectivity and show the potential of geomorphometry in
   assessing such impacts. The overall effect of control works on sediment
   connectivity consists of an alteration of the sediment cascade with a
   decrease in the efficiency of sediment transfer. Sediment is partly
   retained behind grade-control dams within the catchment or in sediment
   traps equipped with retention check dams near the alluvial fan apex.
   These works contribute to decouple the alluvial fans from the upslope
   catchment. On the contrary, channel bed lining on alluvial fans favors
   sediment transfer to the receiving river, but this effect usually
   involves small amounts of sediment not retained by the check dams built
   upstream. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study was to provide a novel
   methodological approach for flash flood susceptibility modeling based on
   a feature selection method (FSM) and tree based ensemble methods. The
   FSM, used a fuzzy rule based algorithm FURIA, as attribute evaluator,
   whereas GA were used as the search method, in order to obtain optimal
   set of variables used in flood susceptibility modeling assessments. The
   novel FURIA-GA was combined with LogitBoost, Bagging and AdaBoost
   ensemble algorithms. The performance of the developed methodology was
   evaluated at the Bao Yen district and the Bac Ha district of Lao Cai
   Province in the Northeast region of Vietnam. For the case study, 654
   floods and twelve geo-environmental variables were used. The predictive
   performance of each model was estimated through the calculation of the
   classification accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity, the success
   and predictive rate curve and the area under the curves (AUC). The
   FURIA-GA FSM compared to a conventional rule based method gave more
   accurate predictive results. Also, the FURIA-GA based models, presented
   higher learning and predictive ability compared to the ensemble models
   that had not undergone a FSM. Based on the predictive classification
   accuracy, FURIA-GA-Bagging (93.37\%) outperformed FURIA-GA-LogitBoost
   (92.35\%) and FURIA-GA-AdaBoost (89.03\%). FURIA-GA-Bagging showed also
   the highest sensitivity (96.94\%) and specificity (89.80\%). On the
   other hand, the FURIA-GA-LogitBoost showed the lowest percentage in very
   high susceptible zone and the highest relative flash-flood density,
   whereas the FURIA-GA-AdaBoost achieved the highest prediction AUC value
   (0.9740), based on the prediction rate curve, followed by
   FIJRIA-GABagging (0.9566), and FURIA-GA-LogitBoost (0.8955). It can be
   concluded that the usage of different statistical metrics, provides
   different outcomes concerning the best prediction model, which mainly
   could be attributed to sites specific settings. The proposed models
   could be considered as a novel alternative investigation tools
   appropriate for flash flood susceptibility mapping. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Resilience is an indicator of the ability of systems to withstand
   disruption within acceptable degradation parameters and also their
   recovery time. It is essential for public policies to understand how the
   population reacts to a particular risk. In this paper we have performed
   a study that quantitatively measures perceptions of flooding and
   resilience to flooding in the city of Colima-Villa de Alvarez, Mexico
   2018-2019. A resilience index has been applied to ten zones of the city.
   In our research we assessed risk perception through a city-wide survey
   with questions based on a Likert scale. An analysis was performed on
   public knowledge of the existing security protocols for floods and
   evaluated the public perception of the availability of critical
   services, such as fresh water, electricity, food, drainage,
   communications and public transport during a flash flood events. This
   research has identified populated low resilience zones that can be
   considered as priorities for resource and effort to mitigate floods and
   their impacts. The novel resilience index developed in this work can
   also be applied to other type of risk that humans face and used as a
   basis for discussions about urban resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall patterns have a potential impact on floods, and the accuracy of
   peak flow determinations can directly affect the accuracy of rainfall
   warning index values. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the impact
   of rainfall pattern on the uncertainty of rainfall warning index for a
   small watershed. Xiawan, in the small Peihe watershed in Henan Province,
   China, was used as a case study. Based on an analysis of rainfall
   characteristics, a fuzzy recognition method was used to identify common
   rainfall patterns in the study area, following which they were compared
   with the regional design rainfall pattern. Design rainstorm flood
   calculation and a water level/flow inversion method were used to analyze
   the rainfall warning indices for different rainfall patterns and to
   establish the relationship between rainfall patterns and the values of
   rainfall warning index. The results show that: (1) rainfall pattern has
   a major impact on rainfall warning index values, and the rationality of
   the rainfall pattern requires consideration. (2) Deviations in peak flow
   between different rainfall patterns were large, and the timing of peak
   rainfall had a considerable influence on peak flood flow; (3) within the
   same early warning time interval, the rainfall warning indices where the
   timing of peak rainfall was at the start and in middle of the event were
   1.67 times and 1.39 times that where rainfall peaked at the end,
   respectively. Further study of the rainfall pattern and its impact on
   rainfall warning index can provide technical support and an empirical
   reference value for the analysis and calculation of early warning
   indices for flash flood events in small watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Severe weather events cause considerable disruptions to social and
   economic activities. Thus, high-precision meteorological products and
   services should be provided in order to forecast high-impacting weather
   conditions a few hours in advance such as those causing flash-floods.
   Today, this goal is mainly fulfilled by nowcasting. However, to fully
   comprehend alluvial phenomena, it is necessary to analyze not only the
   ground hydrological aspects but also the atmospheric dynamics leading to
   heavy precipitating events whose territorial distribution is generally
   complex. Herein, we analyzed the evolution of two convective storms
   which occurred on September 7 and 11, 2017, in the Phlegraean area
   (close to Naples) and explain why the first one, but not the second one,
   led to a flash-flood in Bacoli and Pozzuoli. We found that the
   traditional forecasting techniques failed since the severity of the two
   storms, in particular that of the first one, was not correctly forecast
   by Limited Area Models (LAMs). Using rainfall data, we demonstrate that
   LAM failed because it did not take into account the meteorological
   phenomenon enhancement occurring in the Phlegraean area when storms come
   from south-west due to the presence of Mt. Epomeo (789 m) on the nearby
   island of Ischia. In fact, this mountain has a quasi-pyramidal shape and
   is located at just 15-20 km south-west of the Phlegraean area. Thus,
   short/very-short time forecasting and nowcasting methodologies are not
   fully satisfactory. On the contrary, real-time rain-gauge monitoring
   networks are necessary to achieve high-safety levels in areas subject to
   flash-flood hazards and to promptly alert the population.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flooding is one of the most severe natural hazards and commonly
   occurs in mountainous and hilly areas. Due to the rapid onset of flash
   floods, early warnings are critical for disaster mitigation and
   adaptation. In this paper, a flash flood warning scheme is proposed
   based on hydrodynamic modelling and critical rainfall. Hydrodynamic
   modelling considers different rainfall and initial soil moisture
   conditions. The critical rainfall is calculated from the critical
   hazard, which is based on the flood flow depth and velocity. After the
   critical rainfall is calculated for each cell in the catchment, a
   critical rainfall database is built for flash flood warning. Finally, a
   case study is presented to show the operating procedure of the new flash
   flood warning scheme.}},

Title = {{Non-Stationary Bayesian Modeling of Annual Maximum Floods in a Changing
   Environment and Implications for Flood Management in the Kabul River
   Basin, Pakistan}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence of regional climate change associated with the
   intensification of human activities has led hydrologists to study a
   flood regime in a non-stationarity context. This study utilized a
   Bayesian framework with informed priors on shape parameter for a
   generalized extreme value (GEV) model for the estimation of design flood
   quantiles for at site analysis in a changing environment, and discussed
   its implications for flood management in the Kabul River basin (KRB),
   Pakistan. Initially, 29 study sites in the KRB were used to evaluate the
   annual maximum flood regime by applying the Mann-Kendall test.
   Stationary (without trend) and a non-stationary (with trend) Bayesian
   models for flood frequency estimation were used, and their results were
   compared using the corresponding flood frequency curves (FFCs), along
   with their uncertainty bounds. The results of trend analysis revealed
   significant positive trends for 27.6\% of the gauges, and 10\% showed
   significant negative trends at the significance level of 0.05. In
   addition to these, 6.9\% of the gauges also represented significant
   positive trends at the significance level of 0.1, while the remaining
   stations displayed insignificant trends. The non-stationary Bayesian
   model was found to be reliable for study sites possessing a
   statistically significant trend at the significance level of 0.05, while
   the stationary Bayesian model overestimated or underestimated the flood
   hazard for these sites. Therefore, it is vital to consider the presence
   of non-stationarity for sustainable flood management under a changing
   environment in the KRB, which has a rich history of flooding.
   Furthermore, this study also states a regional shape parameter value of
   0.26 for the KRB, which can be further used as an informed prior on
   shape parameter if the study site under consideration possesses the
   flood type flash. The synchronized appearance of a significant increase
   and decrease of trends within very close gauge stations is worth paying
   attention to. The present study, which considers non-stationarity in the
   flood regime, will provide a reference for hydrologists, water resource
   managers, planners, and decision makers.}},

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In the process of mineral development, large-scale flash floods (or
   debris flows) can be induced by the failure of landslide dams formed by
   the disorganized stacking of mine waste. In this study, the modes and
   processes of mine waste dam failures were explored using 13 experimental
   tests based on the field investigation of landslide dams in the
   Xiaoqinling gold mining area in China. Our 13 mine waste dam experiments
   exhibited three failure modes: (i) Piping, overtopping, and erosion;
   (ii) overtopping and soil collapse; and (iii) overtopping and erosion.
   In addition, the failure processes of the landslide dams included
   impoundment, seepage, overtopping, and soil erosion. Different
   experimental conditions would inevitably lead to different failure
   processes and modes, with the failure modes being primarily determined
   by the seepage characteristics. Overtopping was the triggering condition
   for dam failure. The landslide dam failure process was determined based
   on the particle size of the mine waste and the shape of the dam. These
   findings will provide a scientific reference for the prevention and
   mitigation of natural hazards in mining areas.}},

Title = {{An Urban Flash Flood Alert Tool for Megacities-Application for
   Manhattan, New York City, USA}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Urban flooding is a frequent problem affecting cities all over the
   world. The problem is more significant now that the climate is changing
   and urbanization trends are increasing. Various, physical hydrological
   models such as the Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water
   Management Model (EPA SWMM), MIKE URBAN-II and others, have been
   developed to simulate flooding events in cities. However, they require
   high accuracy mapping and a simulation of the underground storm drainage
   system. Sadly, this capability is usually not available for older or
   larger so-called megacities. Other hydrological model types are
   classified in the semi-physical category, like Cellular Automata (CA),
   require the incorporation of very fine resolution data. These types of
   data, in turn, demand massive computer power and time for analysis.
   Furthermore, available forecasting systems provide a way to determine
   total rainfall during extreme events, but they do not tell us what areas
   will be flooded. This work introduces an urban flooding tool that
   couples a rainfall-runoff model with a flood map database to expedite
   the alert process and estimate flooded areas. A 0.30-m Lidar Digital
   Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area (in this case Manhattan, New
   York City) is divided into 140 sub-basins. Several flood maps for each
   sub-basin are generated and organized into a database. For any
   forecasted extreme rainfall event, the rainfall-runoff model predicts
   the expected runoff volume at different times during the storm interval.
   The system rapidly searches for the corresponding flood map that
   delineates the expected flood area. The sensitivity analysis of
   parameters in the model show that the effect of storm inlet flow head is
   approximately linear while the effects of the threshold infiltration
   rate, the number of storm inlets, and the storm inlet flow reduction
   factor are non-linear. The reduction factor variation is found to
   exhibit a high non-linearity variation, hence requiring further detailed
   investigation.}},

Volume = {{573}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring continental precipitation over Europe with high resolution (2
   km, 15 min) has been possible since the operational production of the
   OPERA composites from the European weather radar networks. The OPERA
   data are the essential input to a hazard assessment tool for identifying
   localized rainfall-induced flash floods at European scale, and their
   quality determines the performance of the tool. This paper analyses the
   OPERA data quality during the warm seasons of 2015-2017 by comparing the
   estimated rainfall accumulations with the SYNOP rain gauge records over
   Europe. To compensate the OPERA underestimation, a simple
   spatially-variable bias adjustment method has been applied. The
   long-term comparison between the OPERA and gauge point daily rainfall
   accumulations at the gauge locations shows the benefit of the bias
   adjustment. Additionally, the daily monitoring shows gradual improvement
   of the OPERA data year by year. The impact of the quality of the OPERA
   data for effective flash flood identification is demonstrated for the
   case of the flash floods that occurred from 29 May to 3 June 2016 in
   central Europe.}},

Title = {{Predicting hourly flows at ungauged small rural catchments using a
   parsimonious hydrological model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{573}},
Pages = {{855-871}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Streamflow data is important for studies of water resources and flood
   management, but an inherent problem is that many catchments of interest
   are ungauged. The lack of data is particularly the case for small
   catchments, where flow data with high temporal resolution is needed.
   This paper presents an analysis of regionalizing parameters of the
   Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD) rainfall-runoff model for
   predicting hourly flows at small-ungauged rural catchments. The
   performance of the model with hourly time resolution has been evaluated
   (calibrated and validated) for 41 small gauged catchments in Norway
   (areas from 1 km(2)-50 km(2)). The model parameters needing
   regionalization have been regionalized using three different methods:
   multiple regression, physical similarity (single-donor and pooling-group
   based methods), and a combination of the two methods. Seven independent
   catchments, which are not used in the evaluation, are used for
   validation of the regionalization methods. All the three methods (the
   multiple regression, pooling-group, and combined methods) perform
   satisfactorily (0.5 <= KGE < 0.75). The combined method (which combines
   multiple regression and pooling-group) performed slightly better than
   the other methods. Some model parameters, namely those describing
   recession characteristics, estimated by the regionalization methods,
   appear to be a better choice than those estimated locally from short
   period of hydro-meteorological data for some test catchments. The single
   donor method did not perform satisfactorily. The satisfactory
   performance of the combined method shows that regionalization of DDD
   model parameters is possible by combining multiple regression and
   physical similarity methods.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, floods have obtained a predominant position among
   natural disasters worldwide, due to their rising number of occurrence
   and negative impacts. Flood and flash flood events affected many places
   adversely and caused serious human and material losses in Turkey. The
   search for a solution related to this problematic issue has become the
   starting point of the research. Noteworthy factors that increase the
   risk of flooding in Turkey include the effects of global climate change,
   increasing number of urban areas, changes in landscape, wrong land use
   decisions, spatial planning approaches disregarding natural thresholds
   and the phenomenon of natural risk. In this context, spatial planning
   approaches are needed to reinforce settlements against flooding
   disasters and ensure sustainability.
   In this study, international conferences and approaches of developed
   countries (United States, European Union and Switzerland) to reducing
   flood risk were investigated. In this context, this study describes
   existing legal-administrative structures and practices for the solution
   of problems caused by floods in Turkey and examines their relationship
   with spatial planning studies.
   The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the key to success in
   all efforts to prevent damages to property caused by floods in Turkey is
   ``the need for ensuring integration of such efforts with spatial
   planning decisions at all scales{''}, by comparing exemplary practices
   in developed countries to those in Turkey. In this sense, suggestions
   are made in relation to the spatial planning regulations and to
   organizational structure based on the findings of the research in
   relation to the application in Turkey.}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses the spatial pattern of changes in rainfall extremes
   of Sarawak in recent years (1980-2014). The Mann-Kendall (MK) test along
   with modified Mann-Kendall (m-MK) test, which can discriminate
   multi-scale variability of unidirectional trend, was used to analyze the
   changes at 31 stations. Taking account of the scaling effect through
   eliminating the effect of autocorrelation, m-MK was employed to
   discriminate multi-scale variability of the unidirectional trends of the
   annual rainfall in Sarawak. It can confirm the significance of the MK
   test. The annual rainfall trend from MK test showed significant changes
   at 95\% confidence level at five stations. The seasonal trends from MK
   test indicate an increasing rate of rainfall during the Northeast
   monsoon and a decreasing trend during the Southwest monsoon in some
   region of Sarawak. However, the m-MK test detected an increasing trend
   in annual rainfall only at one station and no significant trend in
   seasonal rainfall at any stations. The significant increasing trends of
   the 1-h maximum rainfall from the MK test are detected mainly at the
   stations located in the urban area giving concern to the occurrence of
   the flash flood. On the other hand, the m-MK test detected no
   significant trend in 1- and 3-h maximum rainfalls at any location. On
   the contrary, it detected significant trends in 6- and 72-h maximum
   rainfalls at a station located in the Lower Rajang basin area which is
   an extensive low-lying agricultural area and prone to stagnant flood.
   These results indicate that the trends in rainfall and rainfall extremes
   reported in Malaysia and surrounding region should be verified with m-MK
   test as most of the trends may result from scaling effect.}},

Abstract = {{During the summers of 2016 and 2017, the Center for Analysis and
   Prediction of Storms (CAPS) ran real-time storm-scale ensemble forecasts
   (SSEFs) in support of the Hydrometeorology Testbed (HMT) Flash Flood and
   Intense Rainfall (FFaIR) experiment. These forecasts, using WRF-ARW and
   Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model on the B-grid (NMMB) in 2016, and WRF-ARW
   and GFDL Finite Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (FV3) in 2017,
   covered the contiguous United States at 3-km horizontal grid spacing,
   and supported the generation and evaluation of precipitation forecast
   products, including ensemble probabilistic products. Forecasts of 3-h
   precipitation accumulation are evaluated. Overall, the SSEF produces
   skillful 3-h accumulated precipitation forecasts, with ARW members
   generally outperforming NMMB members and the single FV3 member run in
   2017 outperforming ARW members; these differences are significant at
   some forecast hours. Statistically significant differences exist in the
   performance, in terms of bias and ETS, among subensembles of members
   sharing common microphysics and PBL schemes. Year-to-year consistency is
   higher for PBL subensembles than for microphysical subensembles.
   Probability-matched (PM) ensemble mean forecasts outperform individual
   members, while the simple ensemble mean exhibits substantial bias. A
   newly developed localized probability-matched (LPM) ensemble mean
   product was produced in 2017; compared to the simple ensemble mean and
   the conventional PM mean, the LPM mean exhibits improved retention of
   small-scale structures, evident in both 2D forecast fields and variance
   spectra. Probabilistic forecasts of precipitation exceeding flash flood
   guidance (FFG) or thresholds associated with recurrence intervals (RI)
   ranging from 10 to 100 years show utility in predicting regions of
   flooding threat, but generally overpredict the occurrence of such
   events; however, they may still be useful in subjective flash flood risk
   assessment.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyses the downstream hydrological, morphological, and
   socio-economic impacts of the sole operating hydropower scheme -
   Ranganadi Hydel Project Stage I in Arunachal Pradesh (India), the state
   with the largest potential and the highest number of upcoming hydro
   schemes in the country. The project has a large dam with inter-basin
   water diversion for electricity generation, thereby affecting flow in
   two rivers of the Brahmaputra Basin - Ranganadi and Dikrong. Flow
   alterations were measured using Nature Conservancy's Indicators of
   Hydrological Alteration model, while planform changes were studied using
   multi-temporal satellite imagery and Geographical Information System.
   The results indicated significant downstream flow alterations by the
   project in the post-dam period. Post-dam median annual flows in the
   impounded and flow-deprived river - Ranganadi, have decreased by 63\%,
   but increased by 138\% in the recipient river - Dikrong. The former
   displayed channel narrowing and decreased braiding, while the latter
   exhibited a wider and more braided planform. Unexpected releases from
   the reservoir, flash floods, and sand casting were the major problems
   cited by the downstream communities in the Ranganadi sub-basin, which
   impacted upon agricultural lands and livelihoods. This study recommends
   mitigation plans that could be followed by both existing and future
   hydropower projects.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of High-Resolution Ensemble Precipitation Forecasts for Early
   Flood Warnings in Small-Scale River Basins during the Heavy Rainfall

Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, ensemble-based precipitation forecasts from numerical
   weather models are increasingly used for operational flood warnings in
   Germany. However, studies which assess the quality of such forecasts for
   indicators of early flood warnings like the areal precipitation are
   still limited. Therefore, this paper presents an evaluation of the
   COSMO-DE-EPS precipitation forecasts for areal precipitation and its
   spatial variability of eleven small-scale river basins (42 km(2) to 746
   km(2)) located in a mountainous region in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
   The study period covers the heavy rainfall period in early summer of
   2016, where extreme rainfall and floods events occurred in the study
   region. There was a good temporal agreement between the forecasted and
   observed areal precipitation (interpolated rain gauge data as well as
   weather radar), even on an hourly scale. Thus, COSMO-DE-EPS provided
   relatively reliable forecasts for this period, even for shorter lead
   times (< 15 hours). However, several shortcomings were also uncovered,
   which need to be further examined in future studies. The accuracy of the
   ensemble forecasts did not improve with decreasing lead times, although
   the ensemble spread decreased significantly. Furthermore, all the
   ensemble members often underestimated the observations (negative bias),
   especially for longer lead times. This is a critical point, since
   extreme events are either forecasted too late or, in the worst case, not
   at all. The investigation of the spatial precipitation variability
   showed that the ensemble members can reproduce the observed
   precipitation variability in the individual catchments much better than
   the ensemble mean. This is to be expected, as the averaging of the
   ensemble forecasts leads to a smoothing of the precipitations fields,
   especially for longer lead times for which the ensemble spread is
   usually larger. An ensemble-based flood forecasting system should
   therefore not rely on the ensemble mean of the precipitation forecast,
   but must incorporate all ensemble members for subsequent hydrological
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Sedimentation in the Makran active margin is governed by a complex
   interaction of atmospheric, tectonics, and hydrodynamic setting of the
   northern flank of the Gulf of Oman. The mixed clastic carbonate
   sediments in the tectonically and hydrodynamically active environment
   have complicated the distribution pattern. The region is suffering from
   basic sedimen-tological data, and specifically, the sedimentation
   history of the Holocene deposits has been rarely studied in the Iranian
   coast. To deal with this deficiency, surface and core sediment samples
   from the Iranian continental shelf and upper slope of the Gulf of Oman
   have been studied using standard sedinientological techniques. The
   overall sediment distribution pattern demonstrates that the grain size
   gradually decreases from the shoreline to the deeper zones. However,
   some medium- to coarse-grained sand patches can be found in the deeper
   parts, especially in the middle part of the studied area that can be
   related to sediment supply of ephemeral rivers discharging into the sea
   in rainy seasons and (or) high-energy events (i.e., turbidites and
   tsunamis during the Holocene). Several horizons of the coarse-grained
   detrital sediments are detectable in the upper slope sediment cores. The
   coarse-grained materials are received from the hinterland during flash
   floods and could be accumulated due to mass wasting events. The elevated
   amount of organic materials in the upper slope indicates a deficit of
   dissolved oxygen that leads to preservation of organic materials in the
   bottom sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Oman witnessed exposure to various cyclones during the last decade

   future sea level conditions. This study uses a 3Di hydrodynamic model
   and a damage model to quantify the flood extent and flood damage due to
   the 2002 cyclonic storm (ARB01) and to identify vulnerable
   infrastructure in two watersheds: Zayk and Ghadow. The impact of the
   storm is assessed under present day and predicted 1.41 m sea level rise
   (SLR) conditions. The results show that with present sea level
   conditions the residential damage was estimated at US\$ 10.79M and US\$
   32.98M for Zayk and Ghadow respectively. Under a 1.41 m SLR scenario,
   the residential damage is projected to increase to US\$ 13.65M (26.5\%)
   and US\$ 40.28M (22.1\%) for Zayk and Ghadow respectively under a
   similar cyclonic storm event. These results provide knowledge to make
   informed policy decisions that contribute to the development of
   resilient infrastructure. It also provides a flood damage assessment of
   a potential future to prepare Oman for challenges under sea level rise.}},

Abstract = {{Nowcasts (short-term forecasts) of heavy rainfall causing flash floods
   are highly valuable in densely populated urban areas. In the
   Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) project, a
   high-resolution X-band radar network was deployed in the Dallas-Fort
   Worth (DFW) metroplex. The Dynamic and Adaptive Radar Tracking of Storms
   (DARTS) method was developed as a part of the CASA nowcasting system. In
   this method, the advection field is determined in the spectral domain
   using the discrete Fourier transform. DARTS was recently extended to
   include a filtering scheme for suppressing small-scale precipitation
   features that have low predictability. Building on the earlier work,
   Stochastic DARTS (S-DARTS), a probabilistic extension of DARTS, is
   developed and tested using the CASA DFW radar network. In this method,
   the nowcasts are stochastically perturbed in order to simulate
   uncertainties. Two novel features are introduced in S-DARTS. First, the
   scale filtering and perturbation based on an autoregressive model are
   done in the spectral domain in order to achieve high computational
   efficiency. Second, this methodology is extended to modeling the
   temporal evolution of the advection field. The performance and forecast
   skill of S-DARTS are evaluated with different precipitation intensity
   thresholds and ensemble sizes. It is shown that S-DARTS can produce
   reliable probabilistic nowcasts in the CASA DFW domain with 250-m
   spatial resolution up to 45 min for lower precipitation intensities
   (below 2 mm h(-1)). For higher intensities (above 5 mm h(-1)), adequate
   skill can be obtained up to 15 min.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean environment, floods pose a significant threat to
   people, in spite of the noteworthy improvements in forecasting,
   emergency management, and defensive works. This paper examines flood
   mortality in the Mediterranean environment based on a 36-year long
   database (1980-2015) that was built in five study areas using
   documentary sources. Information on fatal accidents was disaggregated in
   database fields describing victim's profile and the circumstances of the
   accidents. Data show an increasing trend of flood fatalities during the
   study period. Accidents mainly occurred outdoor: the majority of the 458
   fatalities were males, mainly aged between 30 and 49 years, and
   residents in the area of the accident. In the majority of cases, people
   were dragged by water/mud when travelling by car. Some cases of
   hazardous behaviours, such as fording rivers or trying to save
   belongings, were also detected. The cause of death was drowning in the
   majority of cases, and heart attack in a few cases it was. The results
   of the research can be proficiently used in information campaigns aiming
   to increase people safety during future floods.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{A large city surrounded by mountains like Hong Kong is susceptible to
   both flash floods in midmountain areas and local flooding in low-lying
   areas when a large rainstorm occurs. Severe rainstorms tend to be more
   frequent under a changing climate. Hence, it is essential to simulate
   rainfall-runoff processes in the urban area and evaluate flood coping
   strategies. This paper presents a model that is capable of simulating
   the overland flow process and underground drainage hydraulics
   simultaneously, based on detailed topographic, rainfall, and drainage
   network information about the northern Hong Kong Island. The model was
   calibrated with a flood-extent map and further validated with a flood
   event in June 2008. Using the model, the flood hazards associated with
   flood coping projects in three phases were simulated. Although these
   flooding control measures were intended to meet a major societal need
   for alleviating flooding problems and are shown to be effective in
   alleviating local flooding, the densely urbanized area may still suffer
   flooding when severe storm events occur. Hence, new strategies are
   needed to cope with the urban flood risk under more critical storms.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on flash flood susceptibility modelling using
   geomorphometric ranking approach in the Ushairy Basin. In the study
   area, flash floods are highly unpredictable and the worst
   hydrometeorological disaster. An advanced spaceborne thermal emission
   and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model was used as
   input data in a geographic information system environment to delineate
   the target basin. A total of 17 sub-basins were delimited using a
   threshold of 4km2. The attribute information of each sub-basin was
   analysed to compute the geomorphometric parameters by applying Hortonian
   and Strahler geomorphological models. The results were analysed and
   categorised into five classes using statistical techniques, and the rank
   score was assigned to each class of all parameters depending on their
   relation with flash flood risk. In this study, 16 parameters were
   analysed to quantify the geomorphometric number of each sub-basin
   depicting the degree of flash flood susceptibility. The geomorphometric
   number of each sub-basin was linked to the geo-database for spatial
   visualisation. The analysis reveals that extremely high, very high, high
   and moderate sub-basins susceptible to flash floods were spread over an
   area of 55\%, 8.5\%, 23.7\%, and 11.5\%, respectively. It was found that
   out of total settlements, 53\% are located in the extremely highly and
   very highly susceptible sub-basins. In the study area, the upper reaches
   are characterised by snow-covered peaks, steep slopes and high drainage
   densities (1.7 mml:mspace width={''}0.333333em mml:mspace km/km2). The
   analysis further indicated that the flash flood susceptibility increases
   with the increase in area, relief and relief ratio of the sub-basins.
   Model accuracy was assessed using primary data regarding past flood
   damages and human fatalities. Similarly, socio-demographic conditions of
   each sub-basin were also compared and linked to the extent of flash
   flood susceptibility. This study may assist the district government and
   district disaster management authority of Dir upper to initiate flood
   risk reduction strategies in highly susceptible zones of the Ushairy
   Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Although increased aerosol concentration modifies local air temperatures
   and boundary layer structure in urban areas, little is known about its
   effects on the urban hydrological cycle. Changes in the hydrological
   cycle modify surface runoff and flooding. Furthermore, as runoff
   commonly transports pollutants to soil and water, any changes impact
   urban soil and aquatic environments. To explore the radiative effect of
   haze on changes in the urban surface water balance in Beijing, different
   haze levels are modelled using the Surface Urban Energy and Water
   Balance Scheme (SUEWS), forced by reanalysis data. The pollution levels
   are classified using aerosol optical depth observations. The secondary
   aims are to examine the usability of a global reanalysis dataset in a
   highly polluted environment and the SUEWS model performance.
   We show that the reanalysis data do not include the attenuating effect
   of haze on incoming solar radiation and develop a correction method.
   Using these corrected data, SUEWS simulates measured eddy covariance
   heat fluxes well. Both surface runoff and drainage increase with severe
   haze levels, particularly with low precipitation rates: runoff from 0.06
   to 0.18 mm d(-1) and drainage from 0.43 to 0.62 mm d(-1) during fairly
   clean to extremely polluted conditions, respectively. Considering all
   precipitation events, runoff rates are higher during extremely polluted
   conditions than cleaner conditions, but as the cleanest conditions have
   high precipitation rates, they induce the largest runoff. Thus, the haze
   radiative effect is unlikely to modify flash flooding likelihood.
   However, flushing pollutants from surfaces may increase pollutant loads
   in urban water bodies.}},

Volume = {{217}},

Abstract = {{In arid areas, water diverted from highly uncertain flash floods is
   often the only source of water for crop production. Stakeholders in
   spate irrigation systems have developed numerous measures to cope with
   uncertain water supply related to low, high and untimely floods. This
   research evaluates the effectiveness of these measures using the MULINO
   Decision Support System (mDSS4) tool which is based on the Driving
   force-PressureState-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. Using data from
   interviews with 101 randomly selected farmers, 17 water user
   associations (WUAs), and 7 system water managers in the Gash spate
   irrigation system in Sudan, we compare the effectiveness with the rate
   of adoption. The results reveal the most effective measures are 1)
   pre-flood preparedness, 2) risk sharing measures through water and land
   management during and after flood by WUAs, 3) crop management by
   farmers; and 4) flexibility in operation by water managers.
   Unfortunately, the most effective measures are not the most adopted
   ones. The level of adoption is primarily related to the capacity of the
   farmers, WUAs and water managers to implement the measures without
   outside support. Generally, measures taken by downstream farmers are
   less effective than those adopted by upstream farmers due to weak
   institutional arrangements and lack of adequate resources. Supporting
   farmers, WUAs and water managers for a wider adoption of the existing
   effective measures will greatly improve irrigation performance and hence
   food security in the study area.}},

Title = {{Implementation and evaluation of a convective/stratiform precipitation
   scheme in Attica region, Greece}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{220}},
Pages = {{109-119}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Attica, which is the region with the largest population in Greece,
   suffers from numerous high rainfall intensity events inducing flash
   floods and, consequently, significant damages in the urbanized areas.
   High rainfall intensities are frequently connected with convection, a
   quiet often phenomenon during either the transitional seasons or the
   late summer thunderstorms. The objective of this paper is to implement
   and evaluate a stratiform-convective classification technique for the
   rainfall events occurred in Attica during the period 2005-2016. As this
   methodology requires only the precipitation records, the satisfactory
   evaluation of this classification approach allows further applications,
   such as, a climatological analysis regarding convective and stratiform
   trends in the study area and generally in Greece. Particularly, the rain
   gauge stations' records used correspond to 10 minute time series from 32
   rainfall stations for the same period, and these data are analyzed and
   processed in order to fit a suitable exponential curve describing the
   stratiform component. A critical annual threshold of rainfall intensity
   in mm/6h is then calculated, separating the prevailing convective and
   stratiform regime above and below this value, respectively. The analysis
   is performed in three individual subareas of Attica region demarcated
   initially according to their morphological characteristics and
   subsequently by checking the cross correlation for each pair of
   stations. This critical intensity threshold is determined for each year
   separately, in order to illustrate the uncertainty and the difficulty in
   identifying a standard threshold, as it is related to the annual
   behavior of precipitation. Using this threshold, a total of about 180
   six-hour case events is detected as purely convective cases, however
   this number ranges for each subarea. For these cases, a further analysis
   is performed with the aim of verifying their convective character.
   Verification includes time-accurate lightning data, surface synoptic
   observations from the Hellenic National Meteorological Service and
   six-hour surface analysis charts from UK MetOffice. Findings, which are
   presented via indicative verification indices, show in general
   encouraging performance, considering the highly variable nature of
   convective precipitation which poses considerable problems in its
   identification with quite simple techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate spatial rainfall data are a key input parameter for distributed
   hydrological models and a significant contributor to hydrological model
   uncertainty when rain gauges are sparsely distributed, especially in
   complex mountain basins. The rainfall data recorded by gauge stations
   are considered to be real and accurate but gauged rainfall data are
   sometimes not representative of the rainfall spatial distribution due to
   a lack of stations. The Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)
   product is widely used to provide the spatial variability of rainfall,
   especially in sparsely-gauged basins. However, the CFSR has a critical
   flaw of a high single-point observation error. Hence, this study
   developed an approach to revise the daily CFSR rainfall data by
   combining gauged rainfall data and considering the spatial heterogeneity
   of the CFSR rainfall. First, Thiessen polygons were generated to define
   the measurement domain of each rain gauge station. Second, spatial
   regression equations were developed between the CFSR rainfall data based
   on the size of the correlation coefficient (R), i.e., the R was ranked
   to determine the criteria. Third, the CFSR rainfall data in the gauged
   pixels were replaced by the gauged rainfall data (CFSR pixels containing
   one gauge station that are termed gauged pixels). Finally, the CFSR
   rainfall data in the non-gauged pixels was corrected based on the
   regression equations obtained in the second step. The upstream of the
   Lancang-Mekong River (transboundary river in Southeast Asia) was served
   as an example and three types of rainfall data (gauged, CFSR, and
   corrected CFSR rainfall data) were applied to establish the Soil and
   Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, which was used to simulate runoff in
   the upstream of the Lancang-Mekong River (UL-MR) at monthly scales. We
   investigated the difference in the SWAT model results among these three
   datasets using the relative bias (BIAS), coefficient of determination
   (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The results indicated that
   the CFSR rainfall data corrected by our proposed method exhibited super
   performance compared to the gauged rainfall data for discharge
   simulations based on the SWAT model; the NSE value increased by 18.92\%
   (from 0.74 to 0.88), the R-2 value increased by 2.30\% (from 0.87 to
   0.89), and the BIAS value decreased by 9.48\% (from 17.4\% to 7.95\%) in
   the validation period at the outlet station of the UL-MR. The proposed
   correction method takes into account the spatial heterogeneity of
   rainfall and achieves a better result for the hydrological simulation of
   discharge than the gauged and CFSR rainfall data, especially in complex
   mountain basins with sparsely distributed gauges.}},

Abstract = {{Rivers in Cameroon were surveyed to collect and document rheophytic
   plants. Rheophytes are the dominant aquatic macrophytes in tropical
   river systems, where they are adapted to extreme environments of rushing
   water (e.g., river rapids, waterfalls and flash floods). Rheophytic
   plants are useful indicators of river health. However, their habitats
   are threatened by human activities such as agriculture, plantation
   development, alluvial mining and dam construction, particularly in
   tropical countries. In this survey we documented 66 rheophytic species
   in 29 genera and 16 families. Two ferns, 8 monocotyledons and 56
   dicotyledons were listed. Apart from the Podostemaceae family in which
   all species are rheophytic, the other 15 families have few species which
   are rheophytic. Five of these families have up to four species and the
   remaining 10 have only one member as a rheophytic species. The
   conservation status of each species is assessed and discussed. This work
   urges botanists, conservationists, and policy makers to do more to
   protect the habitats of rheophytes and put in place strategies and
   action plans for the conservation of this important biological group.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Floods have been severely threatening social development worldwide. The
   occurrence of floods has multiple factors, and the flood risk
   considering road environments needs comprehensive analysis from
   meteorology, underlying surface, and urban road network. Thus, this
   study proposes an integrated method and constructs a road risk zoning
   model (RRZM). In the RRZM, submerged depth was obtained by the Soil
   Conservation Service (SCS) model, and the degree of road importance was
   obtained by the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. These two
   parts were used to characterize road vulnerability. Then the flood risk
   grade was evaluated based on the optimized artificial neural network
   (ANN). Finally, the results of flood risk assessment were obtained by
   road vulnerability and flood risk grade. The RRZM was applied to the
   Chang-Zhu-Tan Urban Agglomeration (CZTUA), China. The results showed
   that the spatial distributions of flood risk and the extent of road
   damage varied remarkably in different cities. Changsha was the most
   sensitive city to floods in the CZTUA. The flood risk zones were
   classified into six levels, and the vulnerable road sections identified
   from the risk zones at level 6 in the maps carried more traffic volume
   than others. By comparing with existing methods, it was found that the
   RRZM effectively reflected the spatial characteristics of flood risk
   considering road environments. It provides a new perspective for urban
   flood risk assessment and disaster response decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are one of the most serious natural disasters, and have a
   significant impact on economic development. In this study, we employed
   the spatiotemporal analysis method to measure the spatial-temporal
   distribution of flash floods and examined the relationship between flash
   floods and driving factors in different subregions of landcover.
   Furthermore, we analyzed the response of flash floods on the economic
   development by sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that the
   number of flash floods occurring annually increased gradually from 1949
   to 2015, and regions with a high quantity of flash floods were
   concentrated in Zhaotong, Qujing, Kunming, Yuxi, Chuxiong, Dali, and
   Baoshan. Specifically, precipitation and elevation had a more
   significant effect on flash floods in the settlement than in other
   subregions, with a high r (Pearson's correlation coefficient) value of
   0.675, 0.674, 0.593, 0.519, and 0.395 for the 10 min precipitation in
   20-year return period, elevation, 60 min precipitation in 20-year return
   period, 24 h precipitation in 20-year return period, and 6 h
   precipitation in 20-year return period, respectively. The sensitivity
   analysis showed that the Kunming had the highest sensitivity (S = 21.86)
   during 2000-2005. Based on the research results, we should focus on
   heavy precipitation events for flash flood prevention and forecasting in
   the short term; but human activities and ecosystem vulnerability should
   be controlled over the long term.}},

   Hospitalizations in Santa Catarina, Brazil}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Extreme climatic events (ECE) are beginning to be perceived as potential
   causes of health disturbances. The assessment of the impacts of certain
   ECE to human health has become essential to health managers and
   caregivers. The objective of this study was to identify the association
   between rates of hospitalization for Leptospirosis and the occurrence of
   extreme hydrological events in the state Santa Catarina (Brazil) between
   the years 2005 and 2014. The association between Leptospirosis
   hospitalizations and the occurrence of floods, flash floods, and
   flooding events was measured through Spearman's bivariate correlation
   coefficient. Flash floods corresponded to 92.6\% of the total
   hydrological events. Coastal regions presented higher admission rates
   than inland. The Leptospirosis presented a seasonal pattern, with a peak
   in the summer months. Positive and significant correlations for monthly
   and annual analyzes were identified for some of the analyzed
   macro-regions, with higher values of correlation in the coastal region.
   The current results suggest the influence of the occurrence of extreme
   hydro-meteorological events on the variability of the hospitalization
   rate by Leptospirosis in the state of Santa Catarina, with significant
   differences found for the coastal and inland regions.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a study on climate-driven flash flood risk in the Boise
   River Watershed using flood frequency analysis and climate-driven
   hydrological simulations over the next few decades. Three different
   distribution families, including the Gumbel Extreme Value Type I (GEV),
   the 3-parameter log-normal (LN3) and log-Pearson type III (LP3) are used
   to explore the likelihood of potential flash flood based on the 3-day
   running total streamflow sequences (3D flows). Climate-driven ensemble
   streamflows are also generated to evaluate how future climate
   variability affects local hydrology associated with potential flash
   flood risks. The result indicates that future climate change and
   variability may contribute to potential flash floods in the study area,
   but incorporating embedded-uncertainties inherited from climate models
   into water resource planning would be still challenging because grand
   investments are necessary to mitigate such risks within institutional
   and community consensus. Nonetheless, this study will provide useful
   insights for water managers to plan out sustainable water resources
   management under an uncertain and changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{The main focus of this paper is the novel use of Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) in natural disaster, more specifically flooding, to improve flood
   resilience and preparedness. Different types of flood have varying
   consequences and are followed by a specific pattern. For example, a
   flash flood can be a result of snow or ice melt and can occur in
   specific geographic places and certain season. The motivation behind
   this research has been raised from the Building Resilience into Risk
   Management (BRIM) project, looking at resilience in water systems. This
   research uses the application of the state-of-the-art techniques i.e.,
   AI, more specifically Machin Learning (ML) approaches on big data,
   collected from previous flood events to learn from the past to extract
   patterns and information and understand flood behaviours in order to
   improve resilience, prevent damage, and save lives. In this paper,
   various ML models have been developed and evaluated for classifying
   floods, i.e., flash flood, lakeshore flood, etc. using current
   information i.e., weather forecast in different locations. The
   analytical results show that the Random Forest technique provides the
   highest accuracy of classification, followed by J48 decision tree and
   Lazy methods. The classification results can lead to better
   decision-making on what measures can be taken for prevention and
   preparedness and thus improve flood resilience.}},

   Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation Model for Flash Flood Analysis}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Satellite remote sensing has been used effectively to estimate flood
   inundation extents in large river basins. In the case of flash floods in
   mountainous catchments, however, it is difficult to use remote sensing
   information. To compensate for this situation, detailed rainfall-runoff
   and flood inundation models have been utilized. Regardless of the recent
   technological advances in simulations, there has been a significant lack
   of data for validating such models, particularly with respect to local
   flood inundation depths. To estimate flood inundation depths, this study
   proposes using a backpack-mounted mobile mapping system (MMS) for
   post-flood surveys. Our case study in Northern Kyushu Island, which was
   affected by devastating flash floods in July 2017, suggests that the MMS
   can be used to estimate the inundation depth with an accuracy of 0.14 m.
   Furthermore, the landform change due to deposition of sediments could be
   estimated by the MMS survey. By taking into consideration the change of
   topography, the rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model could reasonably
   reproduce the flood inundation compared with the MMS measurements.
   Overall, this study demonstrates the effective application of the MMS
   and RRI model for flash flood analysis in mountainous river catchments.}},

Title = {{Landscape Design as a Tool to Reduce Soil Salinization: The Study Case
   of Keriya Oasis (NW China)}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Irrational use and management of water and land are associated with poor
   hydro-geological conditions causing water logging and salinization
   problems, possibly leading to farmland abandonment and economic loss.
   This poses a great challenge to the sustainability of oasis' and
   requires desalinization through reasonable landscape design by multiple
   crossing studies so we collected traditional knowledge by field
   interviews and literature schemes, except for the modern desalinization
   approaches by literature, and we found that the salinization problem has
   been solved by traditional land reclamation, traditional drainage,
   natural drainage and flood irrigation, locally. It is worth mentioning
   that the traditional reclamation in salinized areas requires flood
   water, sand dunes and a salinized pit area; the sand dunes are used to
   elevate the pit surface, and water is used to leach salt from the soil.
   Natural drainage (the depth and width are 4-10 m and 50-100 m,
   respectively) caused by flash flooding has significant benefits to some
   salinized villages in the range of 3000-5000 m and ancient groundwater
   drainage systems, such as Karez are supporting the oasis with drainage
   water for centuries. In addition landscape characteristics, salinization
   and hydro-geological conditions of the oasis were studied from Landsat
   image, DEM, literature and field photos. Then based on the gathered
   information above, a desalinization model was developed to decrease the
   groundwater table and salt leaching in the water logging landscape. Then
   according to landscape characteristics, different desalinization
   approaches were recommended for different landscapes. To address
   environmental uncertainties, an adaptive landscape management and
   refinement approach was developed, and acceptance of the model was
   validated by stakeholder opinion. The results provide guidelines for
   sustainable desalinization design and highlight the importance of
   combining traditional knowledge and modern ecological principles in
   sustainable landscape design.}},

Abstract = {{The early-warning model for flash floods is based on a hydrological and
   geomorphological concept connected to the river basin, with the
   principle that flash floods will only occur where there is a high
   potential risk and when rainfall exceeds the threshold. In the model
   used to build flash-floods risk maps, the parameters of the basin are
   analyzed and evaluated and the weight is determined using Thomas Saaty's
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The flash-floods early-warning
   software is built using open source programming tools. With the spatial
   module and online processing, a predicted precipitation of one to six
   days in advance for iMETOS (AgriMediaVietnam) automatic meteorological
   stations is interpolated and then processed with the potential risk maps
   (iMETOS is a weather-environment monitoring system comprising a wide
   range of equipment and an online platform and can be used in various
   fields such as agriculture, tourism and services). The results determine
   the locations of flash floods at several risk levels corresponding to
   the predicted rainfall values at the meteorological stations. The system
   was constructed and applied to flash floods disaster early warning for
   Thuan Chau in Son La province when the rainfall exceeded the 150 mm/d
   threshold. The system initially supported positive decision-making to
   prevent and minimize damage caused by flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to present a technique that combines multi-sensor
   spatial data to monitor wetland areas after a flash-flood event in a
   Saharan arid region. To extract the most efficient information, seven
   satellite images (radar and optical) taken before and after the event
   were used. To achieve the objectives, this study used Sentinel-1 data to
   discriminate water body and soil roughness, and optical data to monitor
   the soil moisture after the event. The proposed method combines two
   approaches: one based on spectral processing, and the other based on
   categorical processing. The first step was to extract four spectral
   indices and utilize change vector analysis on multispectral diachronic
   images from three MSI Sentinel-2 images and two Landsat-8 OLI images
   acquired before and after the event. The second step was performed using
   pattern classification techniques, namely, linear classifiers based on
   support vector machines (SVM) with Gaussian kernels. The results of
   these two approaches were fused to generate a collaborative wetland
   change map. The application of co-registration and supervised
   classification based on textural and intensity information from Radar
   Sentinel-1 images taken before and after the event completes this work.
   The results obtained demonstrate the importance of the complementarity
   of multi-sensor images and a multi-approach methodology to better
   monitor changes to a wetland area after a flash-flood disaster.}},

Abstract = {{Zeolite cement is one of the main components of the Jurassic to Lower
   Cretaceous fluvial-aeolian succession in the Parnaiba Basin,
   northeastern Brazil. Core and outcrop-based stratigraphic analyses
   permitted the paleoenvironmental and diagenetic interpretation of
   aeolian sandstone and showed the influence of the volcanic substrate in
   the origin of the zeolite cement. The substrate is represented by an
   extensive volcanic plain developed in the last stages of the Central
   Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) in West Gondwana. The siliciclastic
   deposits consist of dune field, sand sheet and wadi deposit facies
   associations. The zeolite cement of the aeolian succession forms
   poikilotopic crystals with anomalous up to 50\% modal content. X-ray
   diffraction and SEM/EDS/CL analyses showed laumontite and Ca-stilbite
   exhibiting, respectively, massive and radial textures. During
   eodiagenesis, the main processes included clay infiltration linked to
   water table fluctuations and flash flood events, producing clay coatings
   and displacive stilbite cementation. Massive laumontite cementation and
   smectite-chlorite conversion occurred in the mesodiagenesis, while in
   the final stages, the zeolite was partially replaced by calcite cement.
   Telodiagenesis is recorded by iron exsudation and the corrosion of clay
   films. Several processes can be inferred to explain the origin of the
   zeolite cement in the Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous sandstone of the
   Parnaiba Basin. After the first magmatic pulse (Triassic magmatism), the
   zeolite-bearing basalts were submitted to chemical weathering, causing
   cation leaching. Afterwards, the deposition of aeolian sands related to
   a wet desert system occurred above this weathered substrate. Fractured
   basaltic substrate favored the release of ions to the surface, with
   fluids enriched in sodium and calcium that percolated the permeable
   aeolian sandstone beds during the diagenesis. Furthermore, zeolite
   cement is geographically associated with the volcanic substrate in the
   western Parnaiba Basin. However, it is absent in the eastern part, where
   the aeolianites overlie sedimentary rocks. We suggest that the system
   was thermally reactivated by the last thermal CAMP phase, with basalt
   emplacement in the eastern Parnaiba Basin linked to the opening of the
   Equatorial Atlantic Ocean (Cretaceous magmatism). The progressive
   heating towards the western part of the basin triggered fluids
   convection, and the enrichment in ions such as Ca2+, Si4+, Na+, Al3+,
   HCO3- and SO42-, promoting optimal conditions for zeolite crystal growth
   (100 degrees C-300 degrees C). Sandstone textural aspects, as well as
   extensional faults and fractures allowed fluids migration resulting in
   the massive poikilotopic zeolite cementation, characterizing one of the
   most singular features of the diagenetic history of the West Gondwana
   record. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of flash flood risks is the basis on which flash flood
   prevention measures and early-warning systems can be proposed and
   reasonably implemented. However, inadequate monitoring of flash flood
   data which mainly occurs in remote areas restricts quantitative risk
   assessment. This study aimed to address the problems of limited data
   availability. A new model that integrating the Cloud-based Information
   Diffusion (CID) model and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is
   developed to assess flash flood risks. The proposed method improves the
   information diffusion function by introducing cloud model, while
   converting single-valued observations with incomplete information into
   fuzzy set-valued samples. The new approach can perform comprehensive
   risk assessment tasks with various indexes that are composed of
   incomplete information. Another advantage of this approach is that it
   can illustrate fuzzy uncertainty, fuzziness, and randomness of risk
   indexes by coupling with the cloud model, the risk magnitude is
   quantified with membership degree. A mountainous watershed in Southern
   China named Yangshan County was selected as the study area. Compared
   with information diffusion (ID) and entropy-based information diffusion
   (EID), the assessment results of the three models are, in general,
   consistent with one another, and agree with the reported values.
   According to the principle of maximum membership degree, Yangshan County
   is determined as a high-risk region when confronting with flash flood
   hazards. This model provides a feasible and effective method on fuzzy
   risk assessment of flash flooding, and is expected to be applied in
   other multi-criteria decision with limited available information or
   small sample problems.}},

Abstract = {{The sudden occurrence and randomness of heavy rainstorms in hilly areas
   pose challenges to the identification of early warning indicators for
   mountain flash flood. This study explores the variation of critical
   rainfall under different rainfall patterns, mainly considering the
   effect of differences in the timing of peak rainfall (i.e., early, late
   or in the middle of the rainfall process). The HEC-HMS model was used to
   simulate the rainfall-runoff process and determine the early warning
   indicators under different rainfall patterns through repeated trial
   calculation. The time-interval characteristic rainfall assessment method
   was then used to verify the theoretical value of critical rainfall
   against information from actual flood disasters. The results show that:
   (1) The timing of peak rainfall within the rainfall event is negatively
   correlated with the magnitude of the critical rainfall. (2) Critical
   rainfall is more sensitive to rainfall pattern than to soil moisture
   content. (3) For the three early warning periods considered, the
   critical rainfall with the BEF rainfall pattern is about 1.20-1.22 times
   that with pattern MID, while the critical rainfall with the MID rainfall
   pattern is about 1.24 times that with BEH. Thus, this paper elucidates
   the impact of the randomness of rainfall patterns on critical rainfall
   and provides a valuable reference for the analysis and calculation of
   early warning indicators of mountain flash flood.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods are among the most devastating natural hazards but the
   analyses of flash floods are hindered by the lack of
   hydro-meteorological data. In particular, data issues are critical in
   ungauged basins. This paper presents an investigation of flash flood
   modeling using coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models.
   Specifically, the TOPography-based hydrological MODEL (TOPMODEL) is
   employed to obtain the flood hydrograph and the coupled 1D-2D
   hydrodynamic model MIKEFLOOD is used to simulate floodplain inundation.
   The methods are tested in the Pajiang River, a mountainous basin in
   South China. The results show that the TOPMODEL effectively simulates
   the flood hydrograph and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of the flow
   rate are larger than 0.80 for both calibration and validation. Also,
   MIKEFLOOD effectively simulates the flood inundation extent and flooding
   depth and the BIAS for simulated water level is - 0.004 m. Further,
   using socioeconomic and historical flood disaster datasets, areas with
   high flash flood risk are identified. A flash flood risk assessment
   shows a clear trend of change in the flood hazard and the spatial
   heterogeneity of the flood vulnerability is significant. A sensitivity
   analysis of the flood vulnerability to the socioeconomic indicators
   indicates that cultivated land is the most sensitive indicators, and the
   population and the construction areas have similar influences. Overall,
   the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models prove effective and can
   be used in practical applications for flash flood risk mapping.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, continuous improvements have been made in weather
   forecasting and flood prediction with great benefit from Early Warning
   Systems (EWSs). Despite the continuous quest for innovation from the
   scientific and user communities, EWSs remain based mostly on hazard
   forecast, and the information on possible consequences and potential
   impacts is generally missing.
   In this work, a methodology for quantitative real-time impact assessment
   for flash floods is presented. The methodology uses a multi-model
   ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty. Moreover, the
   flood forecasting chain, which normally provides only the discharge
   probability of exceeding a given threshold, is extended to include a
   fully 2D hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively
   assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved.
   The procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in Genoa in
   northwestern Italy. This paper discusses the potential challenges and
   opportunities offered by this approach in the decision-making workflow
   in an operational context.}},

Abstract = {{The anticipation of flash flood events is crucial to issue warnings to
   mitigate their impact. This work presents a comparison of two early
   warning systems for real-time flash flood hazard forecasting at regional
   scale. The two systems are based in a gridded drainage network and they
   use weather radar precipitation inputs to assess the hazard level in
   different points of the study area, considering the return period (in
   years) as the indicator of the flash flood hazard. The essential
   difference between the systems is that one is a rainfall-based system
   (ERICHA), using the upstream basin-aggregated rainfall as the variable
   to determine the hazard level, while the other (Flood-PROOFS) is a
   system based on a distributed rainfall-runoff model to compute the
   streamflows at pixel scale. The comparison has been done for three
   rainfall events in the autumn of 2014 that resulted in severe flooding
   in the Liguria region (Northwest of Italy). The results obtained by the
   two systems show many similarities, particularly for larger catchments
   and for large return periods (extreme floods).}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the uncertainty involved in the determination of
   the flash flood guidance (FFG) of the flash flood warning system (FFWS)
   for a small mountainous region (FFWS\_MR) in Korea. The sensitivity is
   evaluated both at each step to determine the FFG and for all steps
   together. The results show that the relative difference of the FFG is
   about 50\% of the current system, most of which involves the channel
   width. Especially, the use of some specific empirical equations to
   estimate the major parameters results in a considerable amount of the
   relative difference of the FFG. In addition, though only four basins
   were field-surveyed, it is found that the indirect estimation of the
   major parameters always introduces some amount of additional
   uncertainty. In conclusion, accurate estimation of the major parameters
   must be the most important procedure to derive an accurate FFG, among
   which the channel cross-section at the exit of the basin lies at the
   center.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{36}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The flood risks are crucially increasing in developing countries around
   the globe due to intense development activities and climate change. The
   extreme casualties and losses wrought by the flood events in June 2013
   in the Uttarakhand (India) have raised the governance issues in
   policy-making and implementation for controlling human activities.
   Besides extreme rainfall, the unplanned development, weak legal
   framework and governance issues were claimed as responsible for
   triggering the disaster. The present study has evaluated the
   environmental aspects of existing policies related to regulate land use
   change and development activities when considered in relation to
   flooding. Analyzing the governance perspective by addressing policy,
   guidelines and mitigation strategies, this study highlighted the gaps in
   policies and practice that could be reshaped to reinforce resilience.
   This study also tried to delineate the high flood level and flood risk
   area along the Bhagirathi river using hydrological and hydrodynamic
   models for the event of 2013 that can assist in policy-making process.
   In summary, the study found that rampant construction at riverside in
   absence of effective building regulations and hydropower policy in the
   state has increased the magnitude of the disaster. The lack of
   multi-institutional coordination in formulating and practice of
   regulatory measures was found as a failure of governance in disaster
   preparedness and flood management. This study strongly suggests for
   compliance of local planning authorities and stakeholders with state and
   national policymakers for establishing collaborative governance. This
   article may help to bridge the gap between administrators and researcher
   for formulizing effective flood risk governance.}},

Title = {{Functional responses of aquatic macroinvertebrates to flow regulation
   are shaped by natural flow intermittence in Mediterranean streams}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Running waters in Mediterranean regions are strongly regulated by
   dams, which produce significant alterations to natural flow regimes.
   Climate change will reduce discharge and increase flow intermittence in
   Mediterranean streams, which will lead to an intensified flow regulation
   to meet water demands. Very little is known about how the functional
   features of aquatic communities vary along combined anthropogenic flow
   alteration and natural intermittence gradients.
   2. As intermittent streams are subjected to natural stress (droughts and
   flash floods), the flow regime alteration effect may differ from that
   observed in perennial rivers. Consequently, studies that aim to
   determine the effects of flow regulation on the functioning of aquatic
   communities in a global change context are crucial.
   3. By applying linear mixed-effect models and null models to the
   macroinvertebrate communities from 65 stream sites in the Segura River
   Basin (south-east Spain), we assessed the separate effects of natural
   flow intermittence and flow regulation, as well as their interaction, on
   biological traits and functional diversity indices.
   4. Natural flow intermittence and flow regulation were mainly associated
   with loss of taxa with semivoltine or univoltine cycles and more
   sensitive aquatic stages (i.e. eggs), and with the replacement by taxa
   with multivoltine cycles and more resistant aquatic stages (i.e.
   adults). Flow regulation intensified the impact of natural flow
   intermittence on some biological traits, producing synergistic effects
   (i.e. decreasing interstitial taxa and tegument breathers and increasing
   taxa with aquatic adult stages). At the same time, antagonistic (life
   cycle) and opposing (shredders) interaction effects were also observed.
   Functional diversity, functional dispersion, and functional redundancy
   underwent a non-random decrease as the flow regime alteration increased,
   and a significant antagonistic interaction was also found between both
   stressors for functional redundancy.
   5. In general, flow regulation effects were stronger in perennial than
   in intermittent streams because natural intermittence imposes a previous
   eco-evolutionary pressure on aquatic biota by selecting those resistant
   or recovery traits that confer resilience to anthropogenic flow regime
   alterations. Thus, the natural flow regime influences the functional
   sensibility of communities to anthropogenic flow alteration.}},

Abstract = {{Hoang Su Phi is a mountainous district in Ha Giang province, Vietnam.
   When the rainy season arrives in these parts, flash floods (besides
   landslides), frequently occur in many areas, seriously affecting the
   socio-economic condition of the district. Therefore, in this paper, we
   have developed an early warning system for flash floods, established
   based on a geomorphological and hydrological approach. The basic
   principle underlying this system is the fact that flash floods will
   often occur where there is high potential risk with sufficient rainfall.
   In the model, eight parameters of the basin were used to build a
   potential flash flood map. Using the spatial processing module in an
   open source software, early predictions from automatic weather stations
   were interpolated and processed online to produce a potential risk map.
   Depending on the threshold of precipitation values, the results
   determined locations where flash flood may occur at various flash flood
   risk indices (FFRI). The system may be applied to support provision of
   early flash flood warning up to 1-6 days in advance in the district,
   allowing the local government ample time to make appropriate decisions
   on the prevention and/or mitigation of damages caused by flash flood
   hazards.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on the influence of rainfall vertical distribution on
   the flood schlep ability of Xulong gully, located upstream of Jinsha
   River. The mountain precipitation vertical distribution formula (MPVDF)
   was employed to fit the rainfall data, the Soil Conservation Service
   curve number (SCS-CN) method to calculate the runoff and the isochrone
   method to calculate the flood peak flow. In addition, the maximum
   diameter of the gravel transported by flood is used to evaluate the
   flood schlep ability. The calculation results of the traditional method
   (TM) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) are also used for comparison.
   The results show that the maximum error of fitting for rainfall data is
   11.58\% and the maximum error of the calculated peak flow compared with
   the calculation of the morphological survey method (MSM) is 3.66\%,
   which highlights MPVDF as more appropriate for the catchments in which
   the precipitation follows a significant vertical distribution law. The
   results of the maximum diameter of the gravel transported by flood of
   MPVDF, TM and IDW were 86cm, 66cm and 69cm, respectively, which means
   the rainfall vertical distribution has great influence on the schlep

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{167-179}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The need to attenuate hydrograph peaks is central to the design of
   stormwater and flood control systems. However, few guidelines exist for
   siting hydraulic control structures such that system-scale benefits are
   maximized. This study presents a new graph-theoretic algorithm for
   stabilizing the hydrologic response of watersheds by placing controllers
   at strategic locations in the drainage network. This algorithm
   identifies subcatchments that dominate the peak of the hydrograph, and
   then finds the ``cuts{''} in the drainage network that maximally isolate
   these subcatchments, thereby flattening the hydrologic response.
   Evaluating the performance of the algorithm through an ensemble of
   hydrodynamic simulations, we find that our controller placement
   algorithm produces consistently flatter discharges than randomized
   controller configurations-both in terms of the peak discharge and the
   overall variance of the hydrograph. By attenuating flashy flows, our
   algorithm provides a powerful methodology for mitigating flash floods,
   reducing erosion, and protecting aquatic ecosystems. More broadly, we
   show that controller placement exerts an important influence on the
   hydrologic response and demonstrate that analysis of drainage network
   structure can inform more effective stormwater control policies.}},

   risk}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{126}},
Pages = {{430-442}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Waterborne and shellfish-borne enteric viruses associated with
   wastewater-polluted coastal waters (e.g. Norovirus, Hepatitis A/E
   viruses, Adenovirus) represent a major threat to human health. Improved
   understanding of the locations and periods of heightened risks can help
   target mitigation measures and improve public health. We developed a
   river-estuary-coast model to simulate virus dispersal, driven by point
   source discharges and river flows in combination with tidal forcing.
   Viral inputs were based on measured wastewater adenovirus concentrations
   and the model was implemented with or without viral die-off. We applied
   the model to the Conwy river (North Wales, UK), through the estuary, to
   the Irish Sea coast where bathing waters and shell-fisheries are known
   to be prone to viral contamination. Using a suite of scenarios, we
   showed that river flow was the primary control of viral export to the
   coast. Since the Conwy catchment is short and steep, and the estuary is
   small and river-dominated, short-duration high intensity `flash floods'
   were shown to transport viruses through the estuary and out to sea,
   despite dilution or die-off effects. Duplicating flow events (i.e.,
   storm clustering) did not double the virus export since the virus
   re-entered the estuary on the flood tide. The tidal magnitude and timing
   of high water relative to peak river flow were also important drivers
   regulating viral dispersal. A worst-case event simulation (i.e.,
   combining high river flows with high viral loading and high spring tide)
   resulted in increased concentrations of virus at nearby coasts, although
   the spatial spread was similar to the previous scenarios. Our results
   suggest that impact models for predicting and mitigating episodes of
   poor microbiological water quality may require careful representation of
   the intensity and timings of river flow when evaluating pathogen
   exposure risk.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in streamflow and sediment runoffs would affect the reservoir's
   functional operation and the construction of soil and water conservation
   measures in China's Loess Plateau. In this study, the long-term changes
   in streamflow and sediment were analyzed for a main stem section of the
   middle Yellow River where the to-be-built large Guxian Reservoir is to
   be located. Results showed that both streamflow and sediment had
   significant downward trends with the rates of -9.4m(3)s(-1)yr(-1) and
   -16.8 million tyr(-1), respectively, during the period of 1961-2017.
   Using the range of variability approach, the change of streamflow regime
   in its postimpact period (1986-2017) was subjected to the moderate
   alteration, whereas the alteration of sediment regime was moderate and
   severe for the first (1980-1996) and second (1997-2017) postimpact
   periods. As an example, the attribution analyses of annual streamflow
   and sediment changes were conducted in a typical tributary catchment
   (Qingjian River) on the right bank of Guxian Reservoir. For the periods
   of 1980-2002 and 2003-2016, climate variability occupied the primary and
   secondary proportions to both streamflow and sediment reductions,
   respectively. Overall, human activities demonstrated the underlying
   contribution to the sharp declines of streamflow and sediment,
   accounting for 68\% and 74\%, respectively, during the period of
   1980-2016. We suggest that, based on the operational life of warping
   dams (built on gully for mitigating gully erosion by raising the
   gully-bed step-by-step), there are risks of flash flood and high
   sediment concentration events in the future because the
   streamflow/sediment-reducing infrastructures may be damaged by extreme
   rainstorms and in turn become the flood and sediment amplifiers.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the influence of sea surface temperature (SST)
   over the Sea of Japan on a heavy precipitation event that occurred over
   the northern part (Northern Tohoku region) of Japan's largest island on
   9 August 2013. Sensitivity experiments with the Weather Research and
   Forecasting model show that warmer (cooler) SSTs prescribed over the Sea
   of Japan in the simulations lead to an increase (decrease) in 24-hr
   precipitation averaged within the Northern Tohoku region, especially on
   the Sea of Japan (i.e., windward) side. Though no significant
   relationship is found between the local maxima and SSTs over the Sea of
   Japan, those SST values over the Sea of Japan affect the evolution of
   the intense convective precipitation; higher (lower) SSTs act to shift
   the location of intense precipitation on the upwind (downwind) side in
   the present event. The different evolution results in a different
   interaction with the downstream orography, leading to no significant
   relationship between the local maxima of intense precipitation and SSTs.
   The differences arise from the sensitivity of convective updraft to
   SSTs. The simulations thus suggest that uncertainties in currently
   available SST products may alter both the area-averaged precipitation
   and the geographical locations of intense precipitation, which can
   potentially impact flash flood and landslide warnings.}},

Abstract = {{A case of an extreme rainfall event in Canberra, the capital city of
   Australia, on 24-25 February 2018 is investigated. Canberra received
   more than the long-term statistical February total rainfall within 6 hr
   on that day, causing overwhelming flash flooding in the city. In
   contrast to many coastal cities or tropical regions, Canberra is located
   at the boundary between the tropics and extratropics and is usually dry
   and warm in February. The diagnostic analysis shows that this relatively
   rare brief heavy rainfall was the joint effects of lower-level warm,
   moist conveyor belts, the remnants of tropical cyclone Kelvin, surface
   cold fronts, and a midlatitude trough at middle to upper levels. The
   lower-level northeast and west conveyor belts of water vapor contributed
   to the accumulation of moisture and created favorable conditional
   instability over Canberra by transporting tropical moist and warm air
   from Coral Sea and from the Kelvin remnant to Canberra prior to and
   during the rainfall period. Enhanced uplift was triggered by the arrival
   of a cold front in the warm, moist unstable air. The rainfall reached a
   peak 13.6 mm in 30 min soon after a low-level frontal updraft coupled
   with middle-to upper-level dynamical uplift ahead of the midlatitude
   trough. After the passage of the upper-level trough, the dry, cold air
   in the rear of the trough stabilized and dried the atmosphere above
   Canberra. The rainfall decreased and ended rapidly.}},

Abstract = {{The synoptic-scale meteorological conditions leading up to the 30 most
   extreme subdaily summer rain events for two regions of the United
   Kingdom (northwest and southeast) were examined for the period
   1979-2013. Using a recently available, quality controlled, national
   hourly rain gauge data set, we were able to identify extreme 3-hr
   rainfall accumulations that may be indicative of flash flooding.
   Composites of the state of the atmosphere leading up to these dates were
   produced to investigate synoptic-scale processes, thus potentially
   allowing for them to be identified in coarse resolution reanalyses and
   in climate models. The results show that the two regions have different
   dominant synoptic-scale conditions leading to extreme 3-hr rainfall,
   which is thought to be related to the type of rainfall typically
   experienced in each region. In particular, positive anomalies in mean
   sea level pressure and the geopotential height at 200 hPa over the
   United Kingdom are associated with extreme rainfall in the northwest,
   where the position of the westerly jet is also important. For the
   southeast, no clear anomalous synoptic-scale conditions could be
   identified; however, localized moisture sources and unstable air masses
   were observed in association with extremes. These results indicate the
   importance of better understanding of both synoptic-scale and
   thermodynamic drivers of short-duration extreme rainfall, with potential
   implications in forecasting and flood warning, as well as for
   understanding the representation of key processes by regional climate
   models.}},

Abstract = {{The Dead Sea shore is a unique, young and dynamic salt karst system.
   Development of the area began in the 1960s, when the main water
   resources that used to feed the Dead Sea were diverted towards deserts,
   cities and industries. During the last decade, the water level has
   fallen by more than 1m per year, causing a hydrostatic disequilibrium
   between the underground fresh waters and the base level. Thousands of
   underground cavities have developed as well as hectometre-sized
   landslides. Despite these unfavourable environmental conditions, large
   tourism development projects have flourished along the northern coast of
   the Jordanian Dead Sea. In this work, which is based on a multi-method
   approach (analyses of radar and optical satellite data, in situ
   observations, and public science), we show that a 10 km long strip of
   coast that encompass several resorts is exposed to subsidence,
   sinkholes, landslides and flash floods. Geological discontinuities are
   the weakest points where the system can re-balance and where most of the
   energy is dissipated through erosional processes. Groundwater is moving
   rapidly along fractures to reach the dropping base level. The salt that
   fills the sediments matrix is dissolved along the water flow paths
   favouring the development of enlarged conduits, cavities and then the
   proliferation of sinkholes. The front beaches of the hotels, the roads
   and the bridges are the most affected infrastructure. We point out the
   importance for the land planners to include in the Dead Sea development
   schemes the historical records and present knowledge of geological
   hazards in the area.}},

   Compostela Valley of the Philippines. Using cross-sectional survey data
   collected in 2013 and 2014, we applied the integrated data envelopment
   analysis (DEA)-based network model to estimate a composite resilience
   score, ranging from zero to one, and decomposed into coping and adaptive
   capacities. The overall resilience score of households is, on average,
   0.75, while the average coping and adaptive capacity scores are 0.61 and
   0.92, respectively. The correlation of the overall resilience with the
   adaptive capacity is significantly higher than that of the overall
   resilience and the coping capacity. This implies that adaptation
   measures of households mainly depend on external assistance that enables
   vulnerable households to recover from calamity, and thus effectively
   achieve post-event life stabilization. No significant difference in the
   overall resilience scores is found among villages in the surveyed area.}},

Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{345-360}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Many land surface processes, including splash dislodgment and downslope
   transport of soil materials, are influenced strongly by short-lived
   peaks in rainfall intensity but are less well accounted for by
   longer-term average rates. Specifically, rainfall intensities reached
   over periods of 10-30 min appear to have more explanatory power than
   hourly or longer-period data. However, most analyses of rainfall, and
   particularly scenarios of possible future rainfall extremes under
   climate change, rely on hourly data. Using two Australian pluviograph
   records with 1 s resolution, one from an arid and one from a wet
   tropical climate, the nature of short-lived ``intensity bursts{''} is
   analysed from the raw inter-tip times of the tipping bucket gauges.
   Hourly apparent rainfall intensities average just 1.43 mm h(-1) at the
   wet tropical site and 2.12 mm h(-1) at the arid site. At the wet
   tropical site, intensity bursts of extreme intensity occur frequently,
   those exceeding 30 mm h(-1) occurring on average at intervals of < 1 d
   and those of > 60 mm h(-1) occurring on average at intervals of < 2 d.
   These bursts include falls of 13.2 mm in 4.4 min, the equivalent of 180
   mm h(-1), and 29 mm in 12.6 min, equivalent to 138 mm h(-1). Intensity
   bursts at the arid site are much less frequent, those of 50-60 mm h(-1)
   occurring at intervals of similar to 1 month; moreover, the bursts have
   a much shorter duration. The aggregation of rainfall data to hourly
   level conceals the occurrence of many of these short-intensity bursts,
   which are potentially highly erosive. A short review examines some of
   the mechanisms through which intensity bursts affect infiltration,
   overland flow, and soil dislodgment. It is proposed that more attention
   to resolving these short-lived but important aspects of rainfall
   climatology is warranted, especially in light of possible changes in
   rainfall extremes under climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Conditional daily rainfields were generated using collocated raingauge
   radar data by a kriging interpolation method, and disaggregated into

   the complete radar rainfall as input, the rainfall-runoff model was
   calibrated based on storm events taken from nested catchments.
   Performance statistics were estimated by comparing the observed and the
   complete radar rainfall simulated hydrographs. Degradation in the
   hydrograph performance statistics by the simulated hourly rainfields was
   used to identify runoff error propagation. Uncertainty in daily rainfall
   amounts alone caused higher errors in runoff (depth, peak, and time to
   peak) than those caused by uncertainties in the hourly proportions
   alone. However, the degradation, which reduced with runoff depth, caused
   by the combined uncertainties was not significantly different from that
   caused by the uncertainty of amounts alone.}},

Title = {{Water temperature drives phytoplankton blooms in coastal waters}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Phytoplankton blooms are an important, widespread phenomenon in open
   oceans, coastal waters and freshwaters, supporting food webs and
   essential ecosystem services. Blooms are even more important in
   exploited coastal waters for maintaining high resource production.
   However, the environmental factors driving blooms in shallow productive
   coastal waters are still unclear, making it difficult to assess how
   environmental fluctuations influence bloom phenology and productivity.
   To gain insights into bloom phenology, Chl a fluorescence and
   meteorological and hydrological parameters were monitored at
   high-frequency (15 min) and nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton
   abundance and diversity, were monitored weekly in a typical
   Mediterranean shallow coastal system (Thau Lagoon). This study was
   carried out from winter to late spring in two successive years with
   different climatic conditions: 2014/2015 was typical, but the winter of
   2015/2016 was the warmest on record. Rising water temperature was the
   main driver of phytoplankton blooms. However, blooms were sometimes
   correlated with winds and sometimes correlated with salinity, suggesting
   nutrients were supplied by water transport via winds, saltier seawater
   intake, rain and water flow events. This finding indicates the joint
   role of these factors in determining the success of phytoplankton
   blooms. Furthermore, interannual variability showed that winter water
   temperature was higher in 2016 than in 2015, resulting in lower
   phytoplankton biomass accumulation in the following spring. Moreover,
   the phytoplankton abundances and diversity also changed: cyanobacteria
   (< 1 mu m), picoeukaryotes (< 1 mu m) and nanoeukaryotes (3-6 mu m)
   increased to the detriment of larger phytoplankton such as diatoms.
   Water temperature is a key factor affecting phytoplankton bloom dynamics
   in shallow productive coastal waters and could become crucial with
   future global warming by modifying bloom phenology and changing
   phytoplankton community structure, in turn affecting the entire food web
   and ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms have rapidly developed as tools
   for remote mapping at very high spatial resolutions. They have recently
   gained in popularity in many application fields owing to the versatility
   of platforms and sensors, ease of deployment, and a steady increase in
   computational power. Obtaining highly detailed topography data over very
   small scales is one of the more typical application domains. Here, we
   demonstrate this application using Structure from Motion (SfM)
   processing over a small river floodplain in Howard County (Maryland,
   USA). Evaluation of the derived bare-earth terrain model with
   state-of-the art LiDAR shows a trivial bias of 1.6 cm and a root mean
   square deviation (RMSD) of 39 cm. We then applied this terrain model to
   extract floodplain and river cross-section geometries of a small stream,
   important during high-magnitude urban flash flood events, with the aim
   to assess its value for floodplain inundation mapping and first order
   characterization of in-channel hydraulics. Initial findings agree with
   traditional stream and floodplain classification theory and thus show
   very promising results for this type of UAV usage. We expect this type
   of application to gain more momentum in the near future with the
   ever-growing importance of more detailed data in order to increase
   resilience to flood risk, especially in urban areas.}},

   The skill of the hydrological simulations is assessed using conventional
   data (discharge measurements from operational networks) and proxy data
   such as post-event surveys and high-water marks. The results show
   significant differences between the experiments in terms of both the
   simulated river discharge and the spatial runoff, whether at the

Title = {{Frequency Analysis of Flash Floods for Establishing New Danger Levels

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{A danger level at a river location is the level above which a flood may
   cause loss and damage to nearby lives, crops, and homesteads. Currently,
   in Bangladesh, the danger level is designed and updated considering the
   riverine flood during the monsoon season (June-September). However,
   during the premonsoon season (March-May), flash floods, almost every
   year, damage crops in some parts of the northeast Haor (saucer- or
   bowl-shaped large tectonic depression) region. Damage to Boro rice, the
   only crop that is grown in this region, is catastrophic to the local
   population and threatens the food security of the country. At present,
   there is no warning or danger level to inform the community to save the
   Boro crops from flash floods in that region. Hence, this study attempts
   to establish a flash flood danger level at 40 locations in the northeast
   region of Bangladesh based on flood frequency analysis and elevations of
   the river floodplains. The homogeneity and adequacy of the data series
   was tested by performing the run test, lag 1 auto correlation,
   Mann-Kendall test, and Mann-Whitney test. After passing the data quality
   tests, flood frequency analysis was conducted using six widely used
   distributions: lognormal, lognormal Type III, Pearson Type III,
   log-Pearson Type III, and Gumbel and generalized extreme value (GEV)
   distributions. Best regional distribution was selected from the
   probability plot correlations coefficient (PPCC), normalized root mean
   square error (NRMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) results. Among the
   candidate distributions, GEV distribution was found to provide the best
   results. Then, the danger level was fixed on the basis of the flooding
   inundation scenarios of different return periods at which the stage is
   at or near the floodplain level. The results showed that for most of the
   stations, the 2.33-year flood level coincides with the existing
   floodplain level. For the rest of the stations, flash flood danger
   levels were fixed at the 5-year return period's flood level. The
   recommended flash flood danger levels were found much lower than the
   existing monsoon flood danger levels. For example, at Sunamganj station,
   the existing flood danger level is 8.25 mPWD (Public Works Datum)
   whereas the recommended flash flood danger level is only 6.41 mPWD. At
   some stations, the difference is too prominent, even more than 5 m,
   which can cause severe destruction for the Boro rice cultivation during
   a flash flood. It is expected that flash flood danger levels estimated
   in this study may assist in flash flood forecasting in the northeast
   Haor region and provide an effective warning at the time of necessity,
   thus minimizing the loss and damage by the flash flood to some extent.

Abstract = {{Recent surface-water and flash floods have caused millions of pounds
   worth of damage in the UK. These events form rapidly and are difficult
   to predict due to their short-lived and localised nature. The
   interdisciplinary Flooding From Intense Rainfall (FFIR) programme
   investigated the feasibility of enhancing the integration of an
   end-to-end forecasting system for flash and surface-water floods to help
   increase the lead time for warnings for these events. Here we propose
   developments to the integration of an operational end-to-end forecasting
   system based on the findings of the FFIR programme. The suggested
   developments include methods to improve radar-derived rainfall rates and
   understanding of the uncertainty in the position of intense rainfall in
   weather forecasts; the addition of hydraulic modelling components; and
   novel education techniques to help lead to effective dissemination of
   flood warnings. We make recommendations for future advances such as
   research into the propagation of uncertainty throughout the forecast
   chain. We further propose the creation of closer bonds to the end users
   to allow for an improved, integrated, end-to-end forecasting system that
   is easily accessible for users and end users alike, and will ultimately
   help mitigate the impacts of flooding from intense rainfall by informed
   and timely action.}},

Abstract = {{To realize the promise of improved predictions of hazardous weather such
   as flash floods, wind storms, fog, and poor air quality from
   high-resolution mesoscale models, the forecast models must be
   initialized with an accurate representation of the current state of the
   atmosphere, but the lowest few kilometers are hardly accessible by
   satellite, especially in dynamically active conditions. We report on
   recent European developments in the exploitation of existing
   ground-based profiling instruments so that they are networked and able
   to send data in real time to forecast centers. The three classes of
   instruments are i) automatic lidars and ceilometers providing
   backscatter profiles of clouds, aerosols, dust, fog, and volcanic ash,
   the last two being especially important for air traffic control; ii)
   Doppler wind lidars deriving profiles of wind, turbulence, wind shear,
   wind gusts, and low-level jets; and iii) microwave radiometers
   estimating profiles of temperature and humidity in nearly all weather
   conditions. The project includes collaboration from 22 European
   countries and 15 European national weather services, which involves the
   implementation of common operating procedures, instrument calibrations,
   data formats, and retrieval algorithms. Currently, data from 265
   ceilometers in 19 countries are being distributed in near-real time to
   national weather forecast centers; this should soon rise to many
   hundreds. One wind lidar is currently delivering real time data rising
   to 5 by the end of 2019, and the plan is to incorporate radiometers in
   2020. Initial data assimilation tests indicate a positive impact of the
   new data.}},

Abstract = {{The coastal and alluvial areas of the Red Sea Mountains are mainly being
   developed for resorts and tourism activities. Given the development of
   occasional flash floods in the central part of the Red Sea area can be
   of destructive consequences to the various anthropogenic activities;
   thus the quantitative and qualitative assessments of the hydrological
   parameters and groundwater occurrence are presented. As a case study,
   Wadi Isl at the Red Sea coast has been hydrogeologically analyzed using
   an integrative approach of remote sensing, GIS and direct current
   resistivity (DCR) tools. The time area-zones have been estimated using
   and Manning's equation into the spatial analyses routines embedded
   within the ArcGIS. In this study, a synthetic effective rainfall of 10
   mm has been applied to compute the spatially distributed runoff
   hydrograph. The estimated total runoff volume is approximately 8 million
   cubic meters, and the peak discharge rate is estimated to 163 cubic
   meters per second, which can be destructive to the main infrastructures
   in the flash flood pathways. Then, the 2D-electrical resistivity
   tomography (2D-ERT) surveys have been carried out at various localities
   along the main wadi course to explore the lateral and vertical variation
   of alluvium thickness and the saturated zones. Notably, the groundwater
   occurrence is contained in the structurally controlled graben.
   Therefore, the study has recommended the construction a main barrier at
   a natural deep gorge of the main outlet in order to fully control the
   flash floods and to enhance the potential recharge to the underlying
   alluvium aquifer. The present integrative approach of both surface and
   subsurface data is definitely needed to maximize the flash flood
   benefits.}},

   explicitly allows for the existence of spatial interactions within
   affected and unaffected regions. Our results show that municipalities
   directly affected by the flood suffered an 7.6\% decrease in GDP per
   capita in the year of the disaster. Three years after the flood,
   however, GDP per capita rebounded back to pre-disaster levels in all
   sectors but the Agricultural sector. Finally, our spatial estimations

Abstract = {{This study aims to understand community risk perception to environmental
   hazards in a border conflict zone context in high-mountain areas.
   Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools were applied by the social
   science team. The results were validated with a hazard map prepared by a
   separate team comprised of geologists. Turtuk, the northernmost village
   in Ladakh, India located near the line of control with Pakistan was
   undertaken as a case study. Turtuk represents a high mountain indigenous
   rural community which has experienced several catastrophic disasters
   (flash flooding and landslides in 2010, 2014, and 2015) and territorial
   armed conflicts (wars in 1971 and 1999 with Pakistan) in recent times.
   The villagers were able to identify various environmental hazards and
   associated risk zones through participatory timeline diagram, and hazard
   and dream mapping exercises. The PRA maps matched the geological hazard
   map of Turtuk, demonstrating that community people are highly aware of
   surrounding hazards regardless of differences in age, sex, education,
   occupation, and religion. They apply indigenous knowledge to deal with
   the adverse climate and calamities. The technique, of analysing
   community vulnerability in the context of conflict and disasters by
   applying qualitative PRA tools and validating the mapping results, as
   piloted in this study is novel and replicable in any disaster setting.}},

Title = {{Natural hazards - their drivers, mechanisms and impacts in the

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{35}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The Shyok-Nubra Valley situated in the NW Himalaya of India represents a
   dynamic environment where continuous tectonics has influenced the
   landscape, geologic and geomorphic processes. With existence of
   communities in such an environment it becomes very essential to document
   and understand the natural hazards. This paper provides a preliminary
   documentation and understanding of the natural hazards and their
   drivers, mechanisms and impacts in this region. Here, seismicity is
   poorly understood, and the earthquake hazards are primarily associated
   with collapse of building (Type-I and II) structures. Intense
   deformation has made the mountainous terrain very fragile, weak and
   highly susceptible to mass movements. The region is susceptible to
   floods and GLOFs, based on OSL dating, we report two flooding events
   (bracketed between 8.5 +/- 0.4 and 7.5 +/- 0.4 ka) and the increase in
   sedimentation rate over a period of 4.3 ka. Here, major settlements are
   on active fans that are highly vulnerable to numerous hazards. Fan
   hazard risk assessment in the Diskit area enabled identification of four
   hazard prone zones that should be avoided for any developmental work.
   Although the frequency of cloudburst and rain-storms has increased, very
   little is understood about the climate and its variability in this
   region. The region is prone to snow avalanche risk, but most of the
   settlements are located in the low susceptibility zone. The aeolian
   geomorphic processes are dominant in the region and desertification is
   prominent in some areas. This work provides a suitable context for
   resolving problems related to natural hazards susceptibility and
   developmental works in this region.}},

Title = {{A multi-criteria approach for assessing urban flood resilience in
   Tehran, Iran}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{35}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Operationalizing the concept of urban disaster resilience is a major
   milestone toward understanding both the characteristics that contribute
   to the resilience of cities to natural hazards and the interactions
   required to build and sustain it. While the measurement of urban
   disaster resilience has recently gained much attention, there is so far
   no optimal approach for operationalizing this concept and therefore
   there is a need to conduct more empirical studies on what constitutes
   disaster resilience and how to assess it. In this study, a resilience
   assessment focuses on the inherent characteristics and capacities of
   Tehran in the context of flash floods from surface water or from the
   overflow of rivers. The measurement approach is based on constructing a
   composite index based on six resilience dimensions social, economic,
   institutional, infrastructural, community capital and environmental of
   community flood resilience. This follows by developing a hybrid
   multi-criteria decision-making method. The applied method is a
   combination of the AHP for prioritizing the selected indicators and the
   TOPSIS tools in order to get Tehran's urban districts ranked based on
   their resilience levels. Data were mostly from the Statistical Center of
   Iran and Tehran Municipality's accessible data sources. The results
   clarify that Districts 6 and 22 are comparatively the most resilient
   districts, while District 1 is the only district with the lowest level
   of resilience. Such place-based assessments have an opportunity to track
   community performance over time and provide the tool to decision-makers
   in order to integrate resilience thinking into urban development and
   resilience-oriented urban planning.}},

Title = {{Representation of Western Disturbances in CMIP5 Models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLIMATE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1997-2011}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Western disturbances (WDs) are synoptic extratropical disturbances
   embedded in the subtropical westerly jet stream. They are an integral
   part of the South Asian winter climate, both for the
   agriculture-supporting precipitation they bring to the region and for
   the associated isolated extreme events that can induce devastating flash
   flooding. Here, WD behavior and impacts are characterized in 23 CMIP5
   historical simulations and compared with reanalysis and observations. It
   is found that WD frequency has a strong relationship with model
   resolution: higher-resolution models produce significantly more WDs and
   a disproportionately high fraction of extreme events. Exploring metrics
   of jet strength and shape, we find that the most probable cause of this
   relationship is that the jet is wider in models with coarser resolution,
   and therefore the northern edge in which WDs are spun up sits too far
   north of India. The frequency of WDs in both winter and summer is found
   to be overestimated by most models, and thus the winter frequency of WDs
   estimated from the multimodel mean (30 per winter) is above the
   reanalysis mean (26 per winter). In this case, the error cannot be
   adequately explained by local jet position and strength. Instead, we
   show that it is linked with a positive bias in upstream midtropospheric
   baroclinicity. Despite a positive winter precipitation bias in CMIP5
   models over most of India and Pakistan and a dry bias in the western
   Himalayas, the fraction of winter precipitation for which WDs are
   responsible is accurately represented. Using partial correlation, it is
   shown that the overestimation in WD frequency is the largest contributor
   to this bias, with a secondary, spatially heterogeneous contribution
   coming from the overestimation of WD intensity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the initial basin-fill processes in an extensional
   nonmarine back-arc basin. Sedimentary facies analysis in the
   southwestern part of the Gyeongsang Basin (Jinju Subbasin), Hapcheon
   area reveals that the succession consists of four facies assemblages.
   The assemblage I mainly consists of disorganized conglomerate deposited
   by flash floods in a streamflow-dominated alluvial fan. The assemblage
   II is dominated by stratified conglomerates and massive, stratified, and
   cross-stratified sandstones, showing architecture of stacked channels
   and bars. The assemblage III largely comprises massive, stratified to
   laminated, and trough cross-stratified sandstones, which are organized
   into channel-fill and bar-accretion structures. It most likely formed in
   sandy sinuous rivers. The assemblage IV comprises gray mudstone
   interlayered with fine sandstone, representing water-logged floodplains.
   Conglomerate and sandstone bodies formed in the fluvial systems appear
   to be randomly distributed within floodplain fines, displaying a great
   lateral and vertical lithologic variation. This study helps understand
   the complexity of basin-fill history, i.e., switching of fluvial
   networks in time and space, in contrast to the simple notion of
   margin-parallel stacking of lithostratigraphic units.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate assessment of Flash-Flood Potential for certain areas is
   mandatory for the improvement of flash-flood forecast and warnings. The
   main aim of the present study is represented by the calculation of
   Flash-Flood Potential Index within the upper and the middle sector of
   Prahova river catchment (Romania) by using 4 hybrid models: Logistic
   Regression-Frequency Ratio (LR-FR) model, Logistic Regression-Weights of
   Evidence (LR-WoE) model, Support Vector Machine-Frequency Ratio (SVM-FR)
   model and Support Vector Machine-Weights of Evidence (SVM-WoE). The
   identification of areas affected by torrential phenomena represents the
   first step performed in the present research. These areas with a total
   surface of 260 km(2) were divided into training areas (70\%) and
   validating areas (30\%). By the mean of Linear Support Vector Machine
   (LSVM) model, 10 flash-flood conditioning factors were selected and
   further used for the Flash-Flood Potential assessment. Based on the
   spatial relationship between areas affected by torrential phenomena and
   flash-floods conditioning factors characteristics, the FR and WoE
   coefficients were calculated. In order to be integrated into Logistic
   Regression and Support Vector Machine (RBF) analysis, these values were
   standardized. According to the results of the 4 hybrid models used for
   FFPI calculation, the high and very high Flash-Flood Potential are
   spread over 33\% of the study area. The model performance assessment and
   results validation were carried out by the mean of the three different
   methods: i) relative frequency distribution of torrential phenomena
   pixels within FFPI classes; ii) ROC Curve (Success Rate and Prediction
   Rate) and AUC value; iii) statistical measures represented by
   Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   hyperpycnal flows}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Marine litter is an emerging environmental threat affecting all world's
   oceans including the deep seafloor, where the extent of the phenomenon
   is still largely unknown. We report the spatial patterns of macro-litter
   distribution within the Messina Strait's channels (Central
   Mediterranean), focusing on the transfer mechanisms responsible for its
   emplacement, a key information to better understand litter distribution.
   Litter is patchy but pervasive on all surveyed channels, reaching
   densities up to similar to 200 items/10 m, the highest reported for the
   deep sea until now. Litter is often arranged in large accumulations
   formed by hundreds of land-sourced items, mixed to vegetal and
   coarse-grained debris, indicating an emplacement from sedimentary
   gravity flows. Such impressive amount of litter can be explained by the
   superposition of a very efficient source-to-sink sedimentary transport
   and a strong urbanization of the coastal area. These findings point out
   that macro-benthic litter pollution is a major, often overlooked, threat
   for deep-sea ecosystems. Further explorations are thus required in
   similar marine settings to fully understand the magnitude of the
   problem, since they may represent the largest litter hotspots in the
   deep-sea.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods continue a trend of costly disasters attributed to changing
   weather patterns and climate disruptions. Small and Medium-Sized
   Enterprises (SMEs) are more vulnerable and ill-prepared to flash
   flooding, compared to their larger counterparts, so they are
   disproportionately affected by such extreme weather events. This study
   reports on the results of a quantitative survey of SME owners/managers
   and employs quantile regression analysis in an attempt to shed light on
   factors affecting resilience barriers to flash floods. Findings suggest
   that the effect of organizational size on SME barriers is reduced as
   barriers increase. In contrast, the effect of organizational age is
   found to be positive with low magnitudes when barriers are either very
   low or considerably high in contrast to negative effects when barriers
   are at moderate levels. A positive influence of the industrial
   affiliation at all barrier levels is also identified. Previous
   experience with flash flooding events as well as the effect of
   profitability are found to have negative impact in most levels of
   analysis. The assessment highlights the need for targeted intervention
   and assistance to the various segments of the SME sector through
   customized guidance and/or ad hoc regulation by focusing on factors
   explaining barriers to resilience.}},

   landuse types, surface imperviousness and drainage systems is developed
   and used as inputs into the SWMM urban drainage model to estimate the
   flood volumes and related risks under various urbanization and climate
   change scenarios. It is found that urbanization has led to an increase
   in annual surface runoff by 208 to 413\%, but the changes in urban flood
   volumes can vary greatly depending on performance of drainage system
   along the development. Specifically, changes caused by urbanization in
   expected annual flood volumes are within a range of 194 to 942\%, which
   are much higher than the effects induced by climate change under the RCP
   2.6 scenario (64 to 200\%). Through comparing the impacts of
   urbanization and climate change on urban runoff and flood volumes, this
   study highlights the importance for re-assessment of current and future
   urban drainage in coping with the changing urban floods induced by local
   and large-scale changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Torrential processes like fluvial flows (flash floods with or without
   intensive sediment transport) and debris flows can represent a threat to
   people and infrastructure in alpine domains. Up to now the hydro
   meteorological trigger conditions and their connection with geomorphic
   watershed characteristics that favor the initiation of either process
   are largely unknown. Based on modeled wetness states we determined the
   trigger types (long-lasting rainfall (LLR), short-duration storm (SDS)
   and intense snow melt (SM)) of 360 observed debris flow and fluvial
   flood events in six climatically and geomorphologically contrasting
   watersheds in Austria. Results show that the watershed wetness states
   play very distinct roles for triggering torrential events across the
   study regions. Hydro-meteorological variables have little power to
   explain the occurrence of fluvial flows and debris flows in these
   regions. Nevertheless, trigger type separation highlighted some
   geomorphic influences. For example, intense SM triggered more events in
   sub-watersheds (torrential watersheds in the study region) that are
   characterized by significantly higher Melton ruggedness numbers than LLR
   does. In addition, the data show that events triggered by LLRs occur in
   sub-watersheds of similar exposures (aspects) other than SDS. The
   results suggest that the consideration of different trigger types
   provides valuable information for engineering risk assessment. (C) 2018

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{658}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of issues are now being addressed using the concept of
   connectivity, which has initiated the development of various methods to
   assess a river's relationship to its catchment. This study tests two
   well established methods, the Effective Catchment Area (ECA) and the
   Index of Connectivity (IC) in the study area of the Fella River in
   northeastern Italy, to gain an idea of their potentials, limitations and
   ability to represent connectivity patterns observable in the field. The
   results show that both methods provide largely agreeing outputs, which
   widely match field observations. Disagreement is mainly found where
   human-induced features, especially roads, encroach the rivers system.
   Focusing on a natural hazard background, the study furthermore
   approaches the issue of events of different frequencies and magnitudes
   and their representation in terms of connectivity. This is done by
   correlating debris flows at varying return periods with the IC, which
   seemed more fitting for this comparison due to the differentiation
   between different intensities of connectivity. Over the entire
   catchment, patterns of debris flow intensities (DFI) only agree weakly
   with the patterns of the IC, however, debris flows reaching the main
   channel show strong correlations with IC values. This can be traced back
   to the fact that connectivity focuses on a catchment's relationship with
   the river anti does not include processes that happen in those parts of
   the catchment not directly linked to the main channel network. The IC is
   therefore able to represent patterns of processes reaching the main
   valley very well but cannot be used to explain or even predict the
   occurrence of processes that have no direct spatial connection to the
   river. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods cause severe natural disasters over the world generating
   property and infrastructures damages, poverty and loss of human life,
   among others. Mediterranean coastal watersheds are specially sensible to
   flash floods effects due to their typical drainage basin features (steep
   slopes, short concentration times, complex orography, etc.) and the high
   rainfall intensity typical of convective systems. In the present study,
   the temporal evolution of the hydrological answer in five Mediterranean
   (SE Spain) ravine basins with sizes from 10.2 km(2) to 200.9 km(2) were
   analysed. A sub-daily SWAT model was used at watershed scale to capture
   the complex hydrological dynamics. Five land use scenarios corresponding
   to no-urbanization (baseline), 1990, 2000, 2006 and 2012 were evaluated
   using GIS-based tools. Additionally, statistical significant differences
   among the studied scenarios were checked employing the Kruskal-Wallis
   and post-hoc tests based on Mann-Whitney test with BH correction. Our
   results show that flash flood risks have increased in the studied
   catchments due to changes in land uses, particularly affected by a large
   urban growth. Observed changes in soil uses have been important since
   the sixties of the last century, because of a high demographic and
   touristic pressure and specially the urban area has enhanced
   considerably during the last 22 years. Currently, some of these
   catchments present around 70\% of their surface occupied by urban land
   uses with high population density producing curve number surpasses 85
   and 90 levels. The hydrological response of the studied basins changed
   to higher flow rate peaks and shorter concentration times. Some
   discharges increased significantly from the baseline land use scenario
   (approximate to 50 m(3)/s 190 m(3)/s, 380 m(3)/s) to the most urbanised
   scenario (approximate to 235 m(3)/s, 385 m(3)/s 940 m(3)/s),
   respectively. These findings provide to urban planning policy makers
   very useful information in the face of flash flood effects, which have
   cost even human lifes in the studied ravine basins during last years.

Abstract = {{Combination of a pre-season wet soil condition and rice straw
   incorporation just before transplanting, which is typical for a tropical
   rice double cropping, can induce a flash of methane (CH4) emission
   shortly after the transplanting. The conventional practice of alternate
   wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation technique that typically starts at
   21 days after transplanting (DAT) can hardly reduce this emission
   because the soil become methanogenic before the onset of AWD treatment.
   Field experiments were conducted in Central Luzon, Philippines, during
   the 2014-2017 dry rice seasons to examine the effects of the timing of
   rice straw/stubble incorporation on the efficacy of AWD in reducing the
   CH4 emission. Two treatments of the timing of stubble incorporation were
   stubbles incorporated during the start of wet land preparation (S1) and
   stubbles incorporated during the dry fallow tillage (S2). For the water
   management, we compared two treatments: continuous flooding (CF) and AWD
   with - 15 cm threshold for irrigation. The AWD under S2 was implemented
   earlier at 10 DAT. We observed a significant interaction (p < 0.01)
   between effects of AWD and straw management on CH4 emissions; the
   seasonal total CH4 emission was reduced by AWD compared with CF by 73\%
   under S2, while the reduction was <20\% under S1. The AWD significantly
   (p < 0.05) increased the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 47 and 48\%
   relative to CF under S1 and S2, respectively. The global warming
   potential (GWP, CH4 + N2O) and yield-scaled GWP were still substantially
   lower by 62 and 59\%, respectively, in AWD than in CF under S2, but the
   reduction was not realized under S1 due to the relatively smaller CH4
   reduction and increased N2O emission. The results confirm that
   pre-season aerobic stubble decomposition and earlier implementation of
   AWD enhanced AWD's mitigation potential in reducing substantially the
   CH4 emission from the tropical rice double-cropping system.}},

Title = {{A model for archaeologically relevant Holocene climate impacts in the

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{208}},
Pages = {{38-53}},

Abstract = {{A repeating pattern of multi-centennial-scale Holocene climate events
   has been widely (globally) documented, and they were termed Rapid
   Climate Change (RCC) events. Non-seasalt potassium ion (K+) series in
   Greenland ice cores provide well-constrained timings for the events, and
   a direct timing relationship has been inferred between these events and
   the frequency of northerly cold polar/continental air outbreaks over the
   eastern Mediterranean Sea through gaps in the mountain ranges along the
   northern margin of the basin. There also appears to be a remarkable
   timing agreement with major archaeological turnover events in the
   Aegean/Levantine region. Yet no physically consistent assessment exists
   for understanding the regional climatic impacts of the events around
   this critical region. We present a simple 2-dimensional Lagrangian
   model, which yields a broad suite of physically coherent simulations of
   the impacts of frequency changes in winter-time northerly air outbreaks
   over the Aegean/Levantine region. We validate this with existing
   reconstructions from palaeoclimate proxy data, with emphasis on
   well-validated sea-surface temperature reconstructions and a highly
   resolved cave speleothem stable oxygen isotope record from Lebanon.
   Given that the RCCs were clearly marked by negative sea surface
   temperature anomalies in the region, we find that the predominant
   climatic impacts of this winter-time mechanism were ``cold and wet,{''}
   in contrast with intercalated ``warmer and more arid{''} conditions of
   non-RCC periods. More specifically, the RCCs are found to be periods of
   highly variable conditions, with an overall tendency toward cold and wet
   conditions with potential for flash flooding and for episodic snow-cover
   at low altitudes, at least in the lower-altitude (lower 1-1.5 km)
   regions of Crete and the Levant. The modelled winter-anomaly process
   cannot address underlying longer-term, astronomically forced trends, or
   the relatively warm and arid anomalies in between RCCs. The latter
   require further study, for example with respect to potential
   (summer-time?) extension of evaporative subtropical conditions over the
   region. Finally, our results imply that the ``amount effect{''} observed
   in Levantine cave delta O-18 (and precipitation or drip-water delta
   O-18) may not reflect the conventional concept related to
   temperature-dependent fractionation and Rayleigh distillation. Instead,
   it appears to arise from a complex and somewhat counter-intuitive
   mixing, in shifting proportionalities, between advected (external) and
   evaporated (Mediterranean) moisture. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{GEOSCIENCES}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{In times of increasing weather extremes and expanding vulnerable cities,
   a significant risk to civilian security is posed by heavy rainfall
   induced flash floods. In contrast to river floods, pluvial flash floods
   can occur anytime, anywhere and vary enormously due to both terrain and
   climate factors. Current early warning systems (EWS) are based largely
   on measuring rainfall intensity or monitoring water levels, whereby the
   real danger due to urban torrential floods is just as insufficiently
   considered as the vulnerability of the physical infrastructure. For this
   reason, this article presents a concept for a risk-based EWS as one
   integral component of a multi-functional pluvial flood information
   system (MPFIS). Taking both the pluvial flood hazard as well as the
   damage potential into account, the EWS identifies the urban areas
   particularly affected by a forecasted heavy rainfall event and issues
   object-precise warnings in real-time. Further, the MPFIS performs a
   georeferenced documentation of occurred events as well as a systematic
   risk analysis, which at the same time forms the foundation of the
   proposed EWS. Based on a case study in the German city of Aachen and the
   event of 29 May 2018, the operation principle of the integrated
   information system is illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the development of a statistical flash flood risk
   index model, which is currently operating in research mode for flash
   flood risk forecasting in ungauged mountainous areas. The grid-based
   statistical flash flood risk index, with temporal and spatial
   resolutions of 1 h and 1 km, respectively, has been developed to
   simulate the flash flood risk index leading to flash flood casualties
   using hourly rainfall, surface flow, and soil water content in the
   previous 6 h. The statistical index model employs factor analysis and
   multi-linear regression to analyze its gridded hydrological components
   that are obtained from the TOPMODEL-based Land Atmosphere Transfer
   Scheme (TOPLATS). The performance of the developed index model has been
   evaluated in estimating flash flooding in ungauged mountain valleys and
   small streams. Numerical results show that the approach simulated 38
   flash flood catastrophes in the Seoul Capital Region with 71\% accuracy;
   therefore, this approach is potentially adequate for flash flood risk
   forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{Defining the surface hydrological parameters represents a crucial factor
   for the sustainable development purposes. In areas with heavy
   precipitation and rugged topography, these parameters control the
   occurrence of some natural hazards, from which the flash flood gets the
   most attention. Traditional methods for the assessment of the surface
   hydrological parameters are costly, time-consuming and provide
   information for limited geographic extent. On the other hand, remotely
   sensed data provide a cost-effective, rapid and wide aerial coverage
   with adequate accuracy. Geospatial analysis of these remotely sensed
   data provides a suitable and effective method for the reconnaissance
   determination of the surface hydrological parameters. In this work,
   digital elevation models, Landsat 8 satellite images as well as digital
   maps of soil and land use for Kyushu Island were acquired and analyzed
   using geographic information system. Surface hydrological parameters
   were determined in terms of watershed boundaries, soil moisture, initial
   abstraction as well as flash flood potentiality. Results of this
   research show a great correlation with historical flash flood events
   that occurred in the island. The northern parts of the island are
   subjected to the threat of flash floods. A follow-up is recommended in
   some areas on the island. As a conclusion, the geospatial analysis
   performs an accurate reconnaissance method for hydrological analysis at
   regional scale, which in turn guides the detailed field observation
   saving time and cost.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic models have been widely used in urban flood modelling. Due
   to the prohibitive computational cost, most of urban flood simulations
   have been currently carried out at low spatial resolution or in small
   localised domains, leading to unreliable predictions. With the recent
   advance in high-performance computing technologies, GPU-accelerated
   hydrodynamic models are now capable of performing high-resolution
   simulations at a city scale. This paper presents a multi-GPU
   hydrodynamic model applied to reproduce a flood event in a 267.4km(2)
   urbanised domain in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, China. At 2m resolution,
   the simulation is completed in nearly real time, demonstrating the
   efficiency and robustness of the model for high-resolution flood
   modelling. The model is used to further investigate the effects of
   varying spatial resolution and using localised domains on the simulation
   results. It is recommended that urban flood simulations should be
   performed at resolutions higher than 5m and localised simulations may
   introduce unacceptable numerical errors.}},

Abstract = {{Late Quaternary terraces and sediments in the Holy Cross Mountain region

   multiple Pleistocene glaciations, provide evidence of increasing
   anthropogenic influence on landscape development since the Middle Ages,

   Nida valleys. The development of the anthropogenic small-scale water
   retention system (ASWRS), including numerous artificial ponds, channels,
   and forges and mills along the watercourses, resulted in changes in
   river patterns, with additional anthropogenic channels, which in turn
   reduced the maximum flood-stage levels during the Little Ice Age. With
   the collapse of the industries and the disappearance of the ASWRS,
   several major flood events took place. Unknown in the earlier Holocene,
   and caused by hydrotechnical failures, the geomorphic effects of these
   catastrophic flash floods significantly exceeded those of natural

Abstract = {{Urban development, topographic relief, and coastal boundaries can all
   exert influences on storm hydroclimatology, making rainfall and flood
   frequency analysis a major challenge. This study explores heterogeneity
   in extreme rainfall in the Baltimore Metropolitan region at small
   spatial scales using hydrometeorological analyses of major storm events
   in combination with hydroclimatological analyses based on storm catalogs
   developed using a 16-year record of high-resolution bias-corrected radar
   rainfall fields. Our analyses demonstrate the potential for rainfall
   frequency methods using storm catalogs combined with stochastic storm
   transposition (SST); procedures are implemented for Dead Run, a small
   (14.3km(2)) urban watershed located within the Baltimore Metropolitan
   area. The results point to the pronounced impact of complex terrain
   (including the Chesapeake Bay to the east, mountainous terrain to the
   west and urbanization in the region) on the regional rainfall
   climatology. Warm-season thunderstorm systems are shown to be the
   dominant mechanism for generating extreme, short-duration rainfall that
   leads to flash flooding. The SST approach is extended through the
   implementation of a multiplier field that accounts for spatial
   heterogeneities in extreme rainfall magnitude. SST-based analyses
   demonstrate the need to consider rainfall heterogeneity at multiple
   scales when estimating the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods in wadi systems discharge large volumes of water to either
   the sea or the desert areas after high-intensity rainfall events.
   Recently, wadi flash floods have frequently occurred in arid regions and
   caused damage to roads, houses, and properties. Therefore, monitoring
   and quantifying these events by accurately measuring wadi discharge has
   become important for the installation of mitigation structures and early
   warning systems. In this study, image-based methods were used to measure
   surface flow velocities during a wadi flash flood in 2018 to test the
   usefulness of large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) and
   space-time image velocimetry (STIV) techniques for the estimation of
   wadi discharge. The results, which indicated the positive performance of
   the image-based methods, strengthened our hypothesis that the
   application of LSPIV and STIV techniques is appropriate for the analysis
   of wadi flash flood velocities. STIV is suitable for unidirectional flow
   velocity and LSPIV is reliable and stable for two-dimensional
   measurement along the wadi channel, the direction of flow pattern which
   varies with time.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to explore whether a relationship exists between extreme
   weather events, sexual violence, and early marriage. We selected two
   districts in Bangladesh that are vulnerable to extreme weather events:
   Sunamganj, which experiences flash flooding, and Brahmanbaria, which
   experiences cyclones and related floods. Survey data was collected from
   120 randomly selected household heads from two villages in these
   districts, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 household
   heads who indicated early marriage was a coping strategy for managing
   effects of weather events. The mixed-methods study finds that early
   marriage of daughters is a coping strategy for managing two negative
   consequences of extreme weather events. First, by minimizing household
   expenses, householders can pay for damage-related expenses. Second,
   unmarried daughters may be subject to sexual violence during a crisis,
   especially in temporary shelters, which would harm both the family's and
   daughter's reputation and prevent future marriage.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of three satellite-based high-resolution gridded
   rainfall datasets, namely the gauge corrected Global Satellite Mapping
   of Precipitation (GSMaP), Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for

   InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) in the hot desert climate

   categorical indices were used to assess the capability of the products
   in estimating the daily rainfall amounts and detecting the occurrences
   of rainfall under different intensity classes from March 2014 to May
   2018. Although the products were gauge-corrected, none of them showed a
   consistent performance, and thus could not be titled as the best or
   worst performing product over Egypt. The CHIRPS was found to be the best
   product in estimating rainfall amounts when all rainfall events were
   considered and IMERG was found as the worst. However, IMERG was better
   at detecting the occurrence of rainfall than CHIRPS. For heavy rainfall
   events, IMERG was better at the majority of the stations in terms of the
   Kling-Gupta efficiency index (-0.34) and skill-score (0.33). The IMERG
   was able to show the spatial variability of rainfall during the recent
   big flash flood event that hit Northern Egypt. The study indicates that
   accurate estimation of rainfall in the hot desert climate using
   satellite sensors remains a challenge.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the use of remote sensing (RS), geographic
   information systems (GISs), hydrologic modeling (water modeling system,
   WMS), and hydraulic modeling (Hydrologic Engineering Center River
   Analysis System, HEC-RAS) to evaluate the impact of flash flood hazards
   on the sustainable urban development of Tabuk City, Kingdom of Saudi
   Arabia (KSA). Determining the impact of flood hazards on the urban area
   and developing alternatives for protection and prevention measures were
   the main aims of this work. Tabuk City is exposed to frequent flash
   flooding due to its location along the outlets of five major wadis.
   These wadis frequently carry flash floods, seriously impacting the urban
   areas of the city. WMS and HEC-HMS models and RS data were used to
   determine the paths and morphological characteristics of the wadis, the
   hydrographic flow of different drainage basins, flow rates and volumes,
   and the expansion of agricultural and urban areas from 1998 to 2018.
   Finally, hydraulic modeling of the HEC-RAS program was applied to
   delineate the urban areas that could be inundated with floodwater.
   Ultimately, the most suitable remedial measures are proposed to protect
   the future sustainable urban development of Tabuk City from flood
   hazards. This approach is rarely used in the KSA. We propose a novel
   method that could help decision-makers and planners in determining
   inundated flood zones before planning future urban and agricultural
   development in the KSA.}},

Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Floods are considered to be one of the natural disasters that seriously
   affect people's lives and property every year. Although, delineation and
   determination of hydrologic basins and their morphometric parameters are
   difficult morphological tasks, GIS-based approach simplifies the
   investigation of various morphometric factors and helps to explore the
   correlation between the drainage morphometry and landform properties.
   The present study is aimed to investigate the spatial distribution of
   drainage basins around Jeddah-Makkah region and its surrounding areas
   (nearly 40,247km(2)) using GIS spatial analysis. The morphometric
   parameters of these drainage basins and their channel systems were
   estimated and calculated. The computed morphometric parameters are
   categorized into the following three main groups: linear, aerial, and
   relief features. The documentation of these parameters was, then, used
   to evaluate and construct flood hazard map of the region. Flood hazard
   map assesses five classes with varying degrees (very low, low, moderate,
   high, and very high) of flood hazard zones. Such hydrological hazard is
   mostly due to the basin's area and its highest relief ratio, relative
   relief, and ruggedness factor. The flood hazard map shows that the city
   of Jeddah is in a moderate to high flood hazard zone, but most of the
   areas surrounding it are in moderate flood hazard zone. This indicates
   that during heavy rainfalls, flash flood could be generated in these
   areas which can be severely affecting the city. In addition, this study
   shows a remarkable correlation between theoretical concepts, data sets,
   and field observations, predominantly highlighting the role of geology
   and geomorphology in influencing the basin morphometry and identity.}},

Abstract = {{Morphometric analysis of a river basin is essential to identify and

   morphometry of Nanganji River Basin, located in the central Tamil Nadu
   prairies, has been studied using remote sensing and GIS. The
   interrelationship between the various morphometric factors of the basin
   has been studied using a correlation matrix. Factor analysis has been
   applied to group the individual morphometric parameters into a smaller
   number of factors. Further, these factors have been studied in relation
   to the sub-basins to understand the existing relation between the
   factors and the sub-basins. Finally, the study identifies environmental
   issues of the Nanganji River Basin mostly related to the river flow
   regime which widens significantly during the monsoon months.}},

Abstract = {{A surface drainage system (SDS) controls catchment hydrology and acts as
   an indicator of geomorphologic processes. In this study, a field-based
   and GIS-integrated approach enabling reconstruction of a surface
   drainage system, which operates during heavy rainfall in small flysch
   catchments, has been proposed. The reconstruction is based on the
   ALS-LIDAR data. The reconstruction of the SDS gave the opportunity for
   analysis of the changes between the river system and the SDS operating
   during heavy rainfalls. Results have revealed that the SDS operating
   during heavy rainfalls is several times better developed than the river
   system. The density has increased from c.a. 1.5 to 13.7 kmkm(-2).
   Moreover, the structure of the SDS has changed, what was confirmed by
   the parameters of the Hortonian type of the analyses. The most
   significant changes were related to the first- and second-order streams.
   These streams were, the most frequently, the man-origin incisions and
   natural-origin incisions/concavities on the hillslopes conditioned by
   micro-relief. The man-origin sub-system reached up to 35\% of the SDS
   functioning during heavy rainfalls, whereas the sub-system composed of
   incisions/concavities conditioned by micro-relief reached up to 24\% of
   this SDS. Smaller lateral valleys included to the SDS during heavy
   rainfalls constitute up to 37\% of the SDS. The permanent streams
   constitute the remaining part of the SDS. Changes in the SDS have the
   influence on the drainage pattern, hydrological response of a catchment,
   and intensity of geomorphological processes; therefore, the changes in
   the SDS and their consequences have been discussed.}},

Title = {{Observing water level extremes in the Mekong River Basin: The benefit of
   long-repeat orbit missions in a multi-mission satellite altimetry
   approach}},

Abstract = {{Single-mission altimetric water level observations of rivers are
   spatially and temporally limited, and thus they are often unable to
   quantify the full extent of extreme flood events. Moreover, only
   missions with a short-repeat orbit, such as Envisat, Jason-2, or SARAL,
   could provide meaningful time series of water level variations directly.
   However, long or non-repeat orbit missions such as CryoSat-2 have a very
   dense spatial resolution under the trade-off of a repeat time
   insufficient for time series extraction. Combining data from multiple
   altimeter missions into a multi-mission product allows for increasing
   the spatial and temporal resolution of the data. In this study, we
   combined water level data from CryoSat-2 with various observations from
   other altimeter missions in the Mekong River Basin between 2008 and 2016
   into one multi-mission water level time series using the approach of
   universal kriging. In contrast to former multi-mission altimetry
   methods, this approach allows for the incorporation of CryoSat-2 data as
   well as data from other long or non-repeat orbit missions, such as
   Envisat-EM or SARAL-DP. Additionally, for the first time, data from
   tributaries are incorporated. The multi-mission time series including
   CryoSat-2 data adequately reflects the general inter-annual flood
   behaviour and the extreme floodings in 2008 and 2011. It performs better
   than single-mission time series or multi-mission time series based only
   on short-repeat orbit data. The Probability of Detection of the
   floodings with the multi-mission altimetry was around 80\% while Envisat
   and Jason-2 single-mission altimetry could only detect around 40\% of
   the floodings correctly. However, small flash floods still remain
   undetectable.}},

Title = {{Disaster Management Dynamics - An Analysis of Chaos from the Flash Flood
   (2013) in the Fragile Himalayan System}},

Abstract = {{Managing a disaster is a very complex issue in which both the people and
   the affected region of the particular country are involved. In
   disasters, the vision of reality entails proper understanding of
   complexity, uncertainty and instability in the backdrop of nonlinear
   dynamics. Decision making in case of disasters is a nonlinear thread
   which has to wind its way through various rhythms and systems that range
   from ground reality to management operations.
   The Uttarakhand disaster of 2013 is not a simple straight line extension
   of a house fire or an automobile accident. It is a mixed web of
   complexity, nonlinearity, instability and chaos. Maintaining hierarchy
   in decision making and managing a disaster of such magnitude in public
   domain has been found to be ineffective in operations. The theory of
   chaos and the science of complexity can lead to better disaster
   management options. In fact, chaos theory provides viable framework for
   management of natural disasters. Chaos theory describes how the human
   society influences the reality. Indeed, in some degrees, the society
   relevant for the region creates it.
   In the Indian Himalayas in Uttarakhand state, during the third week of
   June 2013, intermittent and unprecedented precipitation covering large
   area led to flash floods and landslides. They carried away everything
   resulting in colossal loss of life and property. Incoherencies in
   management occurred mainly because of lack of understanding of nonlinear
   dynamics and deterministic chaos in natural phenomena and a fixed
   approach i.e. `mode lock-in' approach in decision making.
   In this article, the disaster situation is established to have been
   initiated due to forces of deterministic chaos. On this basis, some
   suggestions are formulated where help of the chaos theory may prove
   congenial to decision making.}},

Title = {{Spatiotemporal variation of rainfall and occurrence of extreme events
   over Burundi during 1960 to 2010}},
Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The occurrence of extreme rainfall events, associated mass movements,
   and flash floods especially during recent years motivated the study on
   the spatiotemporal rainfall variability over Burundi. This study used
   data from distinct sources: surface observation (1981-2010), Climatic
   Research Unit (CRU), Global Precipitation Climate Centre (GPCC) for the
   period 1960-2010, and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   (ECMWF) for the period 2001-2017. This study analyzed the main features
   of rainfall over the study domain and demonstrated that extreme rainfall
   contributed to mass movements and flash flood hazard that characterize
   some sections of the study domain. Analysis revealed a decrease of
   rainfall and number of rainy days, supported by a generally decreasing
   trend for annual and seasonal rainfall. The short rains that occur
   during September-December experienced significant variability than long
   rains that occur during March-May, especially from 1990s. The study
   further identified the west, east, and north-east parts of Burundi to be
   more sensitive to extreme events than other sections of the study
   domain. The analysis carried out the existence of high variability of
   rainfall which starts from 1985 with significant decrease of rainfall
   from 1990. The occurrence of extreme rainfall during short rains has
   been attributed to wind circulation anomaly due to influx of air mass
   from Congo basin, local topography, and local wind patterns. This study
   contributes to understand the spatiotemporal rainfall variability, the
   relationship between extreme rainfall events, and its possible impact on
   territory management and will help in forecasting and monitoring future
   extreme events over Burundi.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{129-146}},

Abstract = {{The 2013 Uttarakhand flash flood was such a surprise for those at risk
   that the predominant source of information for their risk was
   environmental cues and, secondarily, peer warnings rather than official
   warnings. Of those who received warnings, few received information other
   than the identity of the flood threat. A survey of 316 survivors found
   that most people's first response was to immediately evacuate but some
   stayed to receive additional information, confirm their warnings, or
   engage in evacuation preparations. Unfortunately, engaging in these
   milling behaviors necessarily delayed their final evacuations. Mediation
   analysis revealed that psychological reactions mediated the relationship
   between information sources and behavioral responses. Further analyses
   revealed that immediate evacuation and evacuation delay were both
   predicted best by information search and positive affect, but
   correlation analyses indicated that a number of other models were also
   plausible. Final evacuation was best predicted by immediate evacuation
   and, to a significantly lesser extent, household together. Overall,
   results suggest that the Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) should
   be considered a useful framework for examining household responses to
   flash floods in developing countries like India. It supports the
   conclusion that a household's first warning source is a function of two
   distinct detection and dissemination systems within a community-an
   official system and an informal system. However, it fails to capture
   what pre-impact emergency preparedness entails for rapid onset events in
   a developing country context. Further research is needed to determine
   the relative importance of situational and cultural characteristics in
   producing these observed differences.}},

Abstract = {{The last decade has witnessed the development of methodologies for the
   post-flood documentation of both hydrogeomorphological and social
   response to extreme precipitation. These investigations are particularly
   interesting for the case of flash floods, whose space-time scales make
   their observations by conventional hydrometeorological monitoring
   networks particularly challenging. Effective flash flood documentation
   requires post-flood survey strategies encompassing accurate radar
   estimation of rainfall, field and remote-sensing observations of the
   geomorphic processes, indirect reconstruction of peak discharges-as well
   eyewitness interviews. These latter can give valuable information on
   both flood dynamics and the related individual and collective responses.
   This study describes methods for post-flood surveys based on
   interdisciplinary collaborations between natural and social scientists.
   These surveys may help to better understand the links between
   hydrometeorological dynamics and geomorphic processes as well as the
   relationship between flood dynamics and behavioral response in the
   context of fast space-time changes of flooding conditions. This article

Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Elongated lenses of palustrine limestone interbedded with
   Mio-Pleistocene fluvial sands were exposed within a sand quarry in the
   north of Kuwait. Detailed field investigations, thorough petrographic
   and nanoscopic examinations and geochemical analysis revealed that they
   were originally precipitated as carbonate microbialite in isolated
   freshwater ponds scattered within a fluvial floodplain. These lacustrine
   microbialites were subjected to intermittent drying and wetting
   conditions and eventually altered to pseudobrecciated nodular palustrine
   limestone through several pedogenic and early diagenetic processes. The
   pedogenesis is exhibited by cracking, nodulization, mottling,
   pseudomicrokarst and root traces. The desiccation macrocracks are filled
   with siliciclastic sands derived from short-lived flash floods.
   Diagenesis is represented by aggradational neomorphism of micrite,
   cementation of cracks and voids by sparry calcite and precipitation of
   biogenic needle-fibre calcite. Concurrently, the cracks filled with
   siliciclastic sands have been calcretized, forming an embedded
   interapalustrine calcrete. Mottling postdates the early diagenesis and
   is manifested by pseudoclotted texture and abundant black spots and
   dendrites, which may have been developed by the marmorization of iron
   and manganese ions due to the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater. The
   C-13 and O-18 values are mostly comparable with those of closed
   freshwater lakes; however, the high negative values of O-18 may be
   attributed to diagenetic calcite. The occurrence of this palustrine
   limestone within a fluvial siliciclastic sequence that lacks clearly
   developed calcrete profiles may present an exceptional setting for
   palustrine limestone.}},

Abstract = {{The South Asian summer monsoon is a complex coupled human-natural system
   that poses unique challenges for understanding its evolution alongside
   increasing anthropogenic activities. Rapid and substantial changes in
   land-use, land-management and industrial activities over the
   subcontinent, and warming in the Indian Ocean, have influenced the South
   Asian summer monsoon. These might continue to be significant drivers in
   the near-term along with rising global greenhouse gas emissions.
   Deciphering the region's vulnerability to climate change requires an
   understanding of how these anthropogenic activities, acting on a range
   of spatial scales, have shaped the monsoon spatially and temporally.
   This review summarizes historical changes in monsoon rainfall
   characteristics, associated mechanisms, and the role of anthropogenic
   forcings, focusing on subseasonal variability and extreme events.
   Several studies have found intensified subseasonal extremes across parts
   of India and an increase in spatial variability of rainfall despite an
   overall weakening of seasonal rainfall in the monsoon core. However,
   understanding these changes remains challenging because of uncertainties
   in observations and climate models. The mechanisms and relative
   influences of various anthropogenic activities, particularly on
   subseasonal extremes, remain relatively underexplored. Large biases in
   the representation of relevant processes in global climate models limit
   the ability to attribute historical changes and make reliable
   projections. Nevertheless, recent advances in modeling these processes
   using higher-resolution modeling frameworks provide new tools to
   investigate the Indian summer monsoon's response to various
   anthropogenic forcings. There is an urgent need to understand how these
   forcings interact to shape climate variability and change in this
   vulnerable region. This article is categorized under: Paleoclimates and
   Current Trends > Earth System Behavior}},

Abstract = {{Frequent flash floods in recent years have resulted in a major impact on
   the living environment, urban planning, economic system and flood
   control facilities of residents around the world; therefore, the
   establishment of disaster management and flood warning systems is an
   urgent task, required for government units to propose flood mitigation
   measures. To conserve the numerical accuracy and maintain stability for
   explicit scheme, the Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (CFL) condition is
   necessarily enforced, and it is conducted to regulate the relation
   between the numerical marching speed and wave celerity. On the other
   hand, to avoid the problem of flow reflux between adjacent grids in
   executing 2D floodplain simulation, another restriction on time
   intervals, known as the Hunter condition, was devised in an earlier
   study. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial and
   temporal distribution of these two time-interval restrictions during
   runoff simulations. Via a case study of the Komarovsky River Basin in
   Russia, the results show that at the beginning of a storm, the
   computational time interval is restricted by the CFL condition along the
   upstream steep hillsides, and the time interval is subject to the Hunter
   condition in the mainstream during the occurrence of the main storm. The
   reason of a reduction in computational efficiency, which is a common
   problem in conducting distributed routing, was clearly explained. To
   relax the time-interval restrictions for efficient flood forecasting,
   the research findings also indicate the importance of integrating
   modified hydrological models proposed in recent studies.}},

Title = {{A Simple Early Warning System for Flash Floods in an Ungauged Catchment

Abstract = {{Under climate change, flash floods have become more frequent and severe,
   and are posing a danger to society, especially in the ungauged
   catchments. The objective of this paper, is to construct a simple and
   early warning system, serving for flash floods risk management in the
   ungauged catchments of the Loess Plateau in China, and offer a reference
   for flash flood warning in other areas in the world. Considering the
   absence of hydrological data in the ungauged catchments, the early
   warning system for flash floods is established by combining the regional
   or watershed isograms of hydrological parameters and local empirical
   formulas. Therein, rainfall and water stage/flow are used as warning
   indices for real-time risk estimation of flash flood. For early warning,
   the disaster water stage was first determined according to the protected
   objects (e.g., residents and buildings), namely the critical water
   stage. The critical flow (flow threshold), was calculated based on the
   water stage, and the established relationship between water stage and
   flow using the cross-sectional measured data. Then, according to the
   flow frequency curve of the design flood, the frequency of critical flow
   was ascertained. Assuming that the rainfall and the flood have the same
   frequency, the critical rainfall threshold was calculated through the
   design rainstorm with the same frequency of the design flood. Due to the
   critical rainfall threshold being sensitive with different soil
   conditions, the design flood and frequency curve of flood flow were
   calculated under different soil conditions, and thus the rainfall
   threshold was given under different soil condition for early warning of
   the flash flood disaster. Taking two sections in Zichang County (within
   the Loess Plateau) as an example, we set the rainfall and water
   stage/flow thresholds to trigger immediate or preparation signals for
   the migration of the population along the river. The application of this
   method to the 7.26 flood events in 2017 in China, shows that the early
   warning system is feasible. It is expected that this simple early
   warning system can provide early warnings of flash floods in ungauged
   catchments in the Loess Plateau and other similar areas.}},

Abstract = {{Fluvial features such as floodplains and point bars are built by
   sediment deposition and sculpted by erosion. Long-term measurements (38
   yr) of the cross-section topography of active floodplains and point bars
   along the freely-meandering Powder River in southeastern Montana, USA
   (mean daily discharge of 12.5 m(3) s(-1)), were used to develop dynamic
   relations between annual sediment deposition and peak-flood discharge.
   Five floodplain sections and five point-bar sections were selected from
   24 cross sections along a 90-km study reach. At each cross section the
   sediment deposition volume per unit streamwise distance was computed as
   the difference between two topographic surveys made in consecutive
   years.
   Snowmelt floods were found to be the dominant annual process. However,
   other processes such as flash floods, ice breakup floods, and autumnal
   floods were important episodically. The dynamic relations were linear
   for both fluvial features. The snowmelt deposition-discharge relations
   showed, in general, that point bars were about two times more efficient
   at trapping sediment than floodplains. Each relation had a discharge
   threshold that must be exceeded before sediment was deposited. Although
   these discharge thresholds for floodplains and point bars had
   essentially the same mean value (69 and 71 m(3) s(-1), respectively),
   they represented different processes. Thresholds for other rivers will
   probably differ from those for Powder River because of different channel
   geometry and sediment characteristics. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A flash flood on 28th September, 2012, rose to a peak discharge of 2357
   m(3) s(-1) from zero within one hour in the ephemeral Nogalte channel in
   SE Spain. Channel morphology and sediment sizes were measured at
   existing monitored sites before and after the flood and peak flow
   hydraulics calculated from surveyed floodmarks and cross-sections.
   Maximum peak sediment fluxes were calculated as similar to 600 kg s(-1)

   10 times and common perennial stream fluxes by 100 times. These high
   fluxes fit the established simple bedload flux -shear stress relations
   for dryland channels very well, but now extended over a much wider data
   range. The high sediment fluxes are corroborated by deposits at >1 m
   height in a channel-side tank, with 90 mm diameter sediment carried in
   suspension, by transport of large blocks and by massive net aggradation
   as extensive, structureless channel bars. Very high sediment supply and
   rapid hydrograph rise and recession produced the conditions for these
   exceptional sediment dynamics. The results demonstrate the extreme

Abstract = {{CO2 injection into an oil reservoir at low temperature can lead to the
   formation of three hydrocarbon phases. Key challenges persist in the
   development of phase equilibrium calculations for three-phase
   hydrocarbon-CO2 systems. One challenge is the identification of a third
   equilibrium phase via stability testing of a two-phase mixture.
   Stability testing requires initial estimates of phase equilibrium ratios
   (K-values). Existing methods for estimating K-values for the
   identification of three-phase behavior are unable to detect the whole
   three-phase region. In addition, many of the initial K-value estimates
   are redundant, wherein convergence is to the same composition. In this
   work, we present systematic procedures for single-phase and two-phase
   stability testing using optimized sets of initial K-value estimates. We
   show that two-phase stability testing requires one to test both of the
   equilibrium phases in the system. We reveal that three-phase
   hydrocarbon-CO2 behavior cannot be resolved across the
   pressure-composition parameter space with existing methods for the
   estimates of the initial K-value. We introduce a new initial K-value
   estimate for two-phase stability testing to resolve three-phase
   behavior. Our approach significantly improves the reliability and
   reduces the cost of phase stability testing. Reservoir simulation
   requires fast and reliable algorithms for stability testing and flash
   calculations. Failure of the phase equilibrium kernel leads to time-step
   cuts and the potential cessation of the simulator. We have implemented a
   combined successive substitution, Newton, and trust-region optimization
   algorithm for both stability testing and multiphase flash calculations.
   We have also developed a novel optimization algorithm to solve the
   multiphase Rachford-Rice equations. We present the performance of our
   phase equilibrium framework using nine characterized fluid systems from
   the literature. Rigorous testing across a wide parameter space
   demonstrates the robustness of our framework. We show specific instances
   of quantification of phase equilibrium in challenging scenarios,
   including near the stability test limit locus in stability testing and
   the critical region in multiphase flash calculations. The results in
   this work address the most prominent difficulties in equation of state
   modeling of CO2 flooding. In sum, this work provides the comprehensive
   detailed algorithms for phase equilibrium calculations for simulation of
   CO2 flooding in low-temperature reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper applied an artificial intelligence methodology for streamflow
   prediction in a flash flood in Pinang catchment based on TOPMODEL input
   and output data sets. TOPMODEL is a semi-distributed rainfall runoff
   model widely used in numerous water resource applications. However,
   literature has indicated relative weakness in TOPMODEL performances in
   streamflow prediction. Thus, radial basis function neural network
   (RBF-NN) has been employed to improve the accuracy of streamflow
   prediction and then compared with TOPMODEL and multilayer perceptron
   neural network (MLP-NN) performances. Four years of daily
   hydrometeorological data sets (for the period between 2007 to 2010) were
   used for calibration and validation analysis. The results have shown an
   improvement from 0.749 and - 19.2 of the calibration period to 0.957 and
   0.001, and from 0.774 and -19.84 of the validation period to 0.956 and -
   3.611 of Nash-Sutcliffe model (NS) and Relative Volume Error (RVE),
   respectively. RBF-NN performance has been established to improve the
   daily streamflow prediction; however, the MLP-NN was better in contrast
   with the involved method in the study. It can be concluded that TOPMODEL
   performance showed a high ability to simulate the peaks compared with
   both AI methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{Many parts of Upper Egypt as Sinai and Red Sea areas were hit by severe
   flash floods since 1976. Wadi Qena is considered one of the most
   watersheds that suffers from floods in Red Sea area. It was recorded by
   the General Authority for Roads, Bridges \& Land Transport (GARBLT) that
   the flash flood destructive effect always occurs on El-Geesh-Hurghada
   Road which is located in the southern part of Wadi Qena watershed. The
   current study investigates the assessment of endangered areas in Wadi
   Qena watershed based on a suggested concept of multi-method approach
   which is a combination of morphometric ranking method and El-Shamy
   approach. The morphometric analysis is applied using set of parameters
   which are classified into three categories: basin geometry, drainage
   network and texture, and relief parameters. For basin geometry, the
   considered parameters are the watershed area (A), elongation ratio (Re),
   circularity ratio (Rc), form factor (Ff), and compactness coefficient
   (Cc). For drainage network and texture parameters, stream frequency (F),
   texture ratio (Rt), length of overland flow (Lo), and drainage density
   (D) parameters are considered. For relief parameters, the parameters are
   mean basin slope (Sm), relief ratio (Rr), and ruggedness number (Rn). A
   filtration process for the above twelve parameters is considered for
   reducing the number of parameters by omitting the parameters which have
   inverse effect on the flood severity of the study area. It is concluded
   that six parameters have a direct effect on sub-basin hazardous
   including A, D, Lo, Sm, Rr, and Rn. Sensitivity analysis is concerned
   for ranking the selected parameters by their significant parameters in
   assessing the most hazard sub-basins. An overall assessment map is
   constructed showing the hazard degrees of the sub-basins. The
   constructed map concludes that the sub-basins are divided into moderate
   and high hazard ones. Moreover, the results show that the high hazard
   degree sub-basins are concentrated in the middle and east of the
   watershed with a percentage of 18.5\% of the total area. The developed
   overall assessment map can be used for assessment and mentoring
   processes of flood mitigation and planning.}},

Title = {{Real-Time Urban Inundation Prediction Combining Hydraulic and
   Probabilistic Methods}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Damage caused by flash floods is increasing due to urbanization and
   climate change, thus it is important to recognize floods in advance. The
   current physical hydraulic runoff model has been used to predict
   inundation in urban areas. Even though the physical calculation process
   is astute and elaborate, it has several shortcomings in regard to
   real-time flood prediction. The physical model requires various data,
   such as rainfall, hydrological parameters, and one-/two-dimensional
   (1D/2D) urban flood simulations. In addition, it is difficult to secure
   lead time because of the considerable simulation time required. This
   study presents an immediate solution to these problems by combining
   hydraulic and probabilistic methods. The accumulative overflows from
   manholes and an inundation map were predicted within the study area.
   That is, the method for predicting manhole overflows and an inundation
   map from rainfall in an urban area is proposed based on results from
   hydraulic simulations and uncertainty analysis. The Second Verification
   Algorithm of Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs (SVNARX)
   model is used to learn the relationship between rainfall and overflow,
   which is calculated from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's
   Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). In addition, a Self-Organizing
   Feature Map (SOFM) is used to suggest the proper inundation area by
   clustering inundation maps from a 2D flood simulation model based on
   manhole overflow from SWMM. The results from two artificial neural
   networks (SVNARX and SOFM) were estimated in parallel and interpolated
   to provide prediction in a short period of time. Real-time flood
   prediction with the hydraulic and probabilistic models suggested in this
   study improves the accuracy of the predicted flood inundation map and
   secures lead time. Through the presented method, the goodness of fit of
   the inundation area reached 80.4\% compared with the verified 2D
   inundation model.}},

Title = {{Using Tabu Search Adjusted with Urban Sewer Flood Simulation to Improve
   Pluvial Flood Warning via Rainfall Thresholds}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Pluvial floods are the most frequent natural hazard impacting urban
   cities because of extreme rainfall intensity within short duration.
   Owing to the complex interaction between rainfall, drainage systems and
   overland flow, pluvial flood warning poses a challenge for many
   metropolises. Although physical-based flood inundation models could
   identify inundated locations, hydrodynamic modeling is limited in terms
   of computational costs and sophisticated calibration. Thus, herein, a
   quick pluvial flood warning system using rainfall thresholds for central
   Taipei is developed. A tabu search algorithm is implemented with
   hydrological-analysis-based initial boundary conditions to optimize
   rainfall thresholds. Furthermore, a cross test is adopted to evaluate
   the effect of each rainfall event on rainfall threshold optimization.
   Urban sewer flood is simulated via hydrodynamic modeling with
   calibration using crowdsourced data. The locations and time of
   occurrence of pluvial floods can be obtained to increase the quality of
   observed data that dominate the accuracy of pluvial flood warning when
   using rainfall thresholds. The optimization process is a tabu search
   based on flood reports and observed data for six flood-prone districts
   in central Taipei. The results show that optimum rainfall thresholds can
   be efficiently determined through tabu search and the accuracy of the
   issued flood warnings can be significantly improved.}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The China flash flood investigation and evaluation database (CFFIED)
   covers important information needed for China's flash flood warning.
   This paper uses a statistical induction method, inference formula method
   and standardized unit hydrograph method to explore its principle,
   characteristics, and key steps. Then based on the field investigation
   and the latest data on the flash flood, the Hunjiang District in
   northeastern China was selected as the research area. Firstly, three
   typical riverside villages, Xiangmo-1 and Sanchahe-3, Shangqing-4, were
   screened, and the flash flood warning indicators (e.g., water level,
   flow rate, critical rainfall) in the CFFIED were updated. Then, the
   maximum error of the flood peak, estimated by the inference formula
   method and the water level flow relationship method, is only 10.6\%,
   which indicates that the predicted flood peak flow has high credibility
   and can check and identify the early warning index; the Manning formula
   is more accurate in calculating the water level flow relationship.
   However, the calculated ratio is lower and the roughness is higher, and
   the flow is smaller under the same water level. Finally, the updated
   flash flood warning indicators were obtained in the Hunjiang District,
   which improves the accuracy of the flash flood warning, and provides a
   reference for updating the early warning indicators in other areas.}},

Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{The prediction and calculation of the volume of gravel and/or sand
   transported down streams and riverscalled bed-load transport is one of
   the most difficult things for river engineers and designers because, in
   addition to field measurements, personnel involved in such activities
   need to be highly experienced. Bed-load transport treated by many
   engineers marginally or omitted and often receives only minor
   consideration from engineers or may be entirely disregarded simply
   because they do not know how to address the issuein many cases, this is
   a fundamental problem in river management tasks such as: flood
   protection works; river bank protection works against erosion; building
   bridges and culverts; building water reservoirs and dams; checking dams
   and any other hydraulic structures. Thus, to share our experience in our
   paper, bed-load transport was calculated in two river/stream mountain
   catchments, which are different in terms of the characteristics of the
   catchment area and the level of river engineering works performed along
   the stream channelboth are tributaries of the Dunajec River and have
   similar Carpathian flysh geology. The studies were performed in the
   Mlyne stream and in the Lososina River in Polish Carpathians. Mlynne is
   one of the streams in the Gorce Mountainsit is prone to flash flooding
   events and has caused many problems with floods in the past. It flows
   partially in the natural river channel and partially in a trained river
   channel lined with concrete revetments. The stream bed load is
   accumulated in the reservoir upstream of the check dam. The Lososina
   River is one of the Polish Carpathian mountainous streams which crosses
   the south of the Beskid Wyspowy Mountains. It mostly has a gravel bed
   and it is flashy and experiences frequent flooding spring. At the mouth
   of the Lososina River, there is one of the largest Polish Carpathian
   artificial lakesthe Czchow lake. The Lososina mostly transports gravel
   as the bed load to the Czchow water reservoir where the sediment is
   deposited. In the early seventies, the Lososina was partly canalised,
   especially in places where passes inhabited areas. The paper compares
   the situation of bed-load transport in the Lososina River before and
   after engineering training works showing how much sediment is
   transported downstream along the river channel to the Czchow artificial
   lake. Also compared is the Mlynne bed load transport upstream and
   downstream from the check dam showing how much sediment might be
   transported and deposited in the reservoir upstream from the check dam
   and when one could expect this reservoir to be clogged.}},

Journal = {{LAND}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Hurricane Harvey (2017) caused widespread flash flooding by extremely
   heavy rainfall and resulted in tremendous damage, including 82
   fatalities and huge economic loss in the Houston, Texas area. To reduce
   hazards, loss, and to improve urban resilience, it is important to
   understand the factors that influence the occurrence of flooding events.
   People rely on natural resources and different land uses to reduce the
   severity of flood impacts and mitigate the risk. In this study, we
   focused the impacts of land use on Hurricane-Harvey-induced flooding
   inside and outside the Houston city center. With the recent trend that
   more citizen scientists serve in delivering information about natural
   disaster response, local residents in Houston areas participated in
   delineating the flooded areas in Hurricane Harvey. The flooding
   information used here generated a published map with citizen-contributed
   flooding data. A regional model framework with spatial autocovariates
   was employed to understand those interactions. Different land use
   patterns and types affected the potential of flooding events differently
   inside and outside Houston's city center. Explicitly, we found
   agricultural and open space were associated with high risk of flooding
   outside the city center, industrial lands increased the high risk of
   flooding in city center, and residential areas reduced the potential of
   flooding both inside and outside the city center. The results can assist
   with future land use strategy in Houston and other areas, and mitigate
   potential flash flooding. This study also highlighted the contribution
   of citizen science to responses to natural hazards.}},

Abstract = {{The study of precipitation and temperature variability in Portugal,
   including their extremes, is often restricted by the lack of
   high-resolution gridded datasets at daily timescales and available for
   sufficiently long time periods. They are of quite importance specially
   when considering hydrology modeling at a local scale. To overcome this
   limitation, we develop new high-resolution gridded datasets (similar to
   1 km) of daily precipitation (1950-2015) over Portugal. Daily
   precipitation is downscaled by ordinary kriging from a coarser gridded
   dataset (similar to 20 km). Daily temperatures were retrieved from a
   previous work and extracted for the target watershed in this study,
   Corgo River (northern Portugal). The aim of the present study was to
   investigate the potential of the new high-resolution data in improving
   the performance of a distributed hydrologic model, Hydrological
   Simulation Program - FORTRAN (HSPF) in simulating flowrates at one
   target watershed in northern Portugal (Corgo River watershed), thus
   providing a practical basis for subsequent hydrological analysis. The
   performances of the HSPF model, driven by either a single weather
   station or the new gridded datasets are compared. The results clearly
   hint at an improved model performance when using our dataset
   (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency at daily timescale: 0.34 for
   the single-station run and 0.64 for the multi-point run). A good
   performance was also found in reproducing specific flash flood events.
   Although the advantage of using these novel climatic datasets for
   hydrologic modeling in Portugal is demonstrated herein, they can be
   applied to other areas of research, such as ecology, agriculture and
   forestry, contributing to more accurate decision support systems to
   assist decision-makers and stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying flood risk-prone areas in the regions of extreme aridity
   conditions is essential for mitigating flood risk and rainwater
   harvesting. Accordingly, the present work is addressed to the assessment
   of the flood risk depending on spatial analytic hierarchy process of the
   integration between both Remote Sensing Techniques (RST) and Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS). This integration results in enhancing the
   analysis with the savings of time and efforts. There are several remote
   sensing-based data used in conducting this research, including a digital
   elevation model with an accuracy of 30m, spatial soil and geologic maps,
   historical daily rainfall records, and data on rainwater drainage
   systems. Five return periods (REPs) (2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and
   200years) corresponding to flood hazards and vulnerability developments
   maps were applied via the weighted overlay technique. Although the
   results indicate lower rates of annual rainfall (53-71mm from the
   southeast to the northwest), the city has been exposed to destructive
   flash floods. The flood risk categories for a 100-year REP were very
   high, high, medium, low, and very low with 17\%, 41\%, 33\%, 8\%, and
   1\% of total area, respectively. These classes correspond to residential
   zones and principal roads, which lead to catastrophic flash floods.
   These floods have caused socioeconomic losses, soil erosion,
   infrastructure damage, land degradation, vegetation loss, and
   submergence of cities, as well life loss. The results prove the GIS and
   RST effectiveness in mitigating flood risks and in helping decision
   makers in flood risk mitigation and rainwater harvesting.}},

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) contribute to geomorphological and
   hydrological applications. DEMs can be derived using different remote
   sensing-based datasets, such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar
   (InSAR) (e.g., Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array
   type L-band SAR (PALSAR) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)
   DEMs). In addition, there is also the Digital Surface Model (DSM)
   derived from optical tri-stereo ALOS Panchromatic Remote-sensing
   Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) imagery. In this study, we
   evaluated satellite-based DEMs, SRTM (Global) GL1 DEM V003 28.5 m, ALOS
   DSM 28.5 m, and PALSAR DEMs 12.5 m and 28.5 m, and their derived channel
   networks/orders. We carried out these assessments using Light Detection
   and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and Digital Terrain
   Models (DTMs) and their derived channel networks and Strahler orders as
   reference datasets at comparable spatial resolutions. We introduced a
   pixel-based method for the quantitative horizontal evaluation of the
   channel networks and Strahler orders derived from global DEMs utilizing
   confusion matrices at different flow accumulation area thresholds (ATs)
   and pixel buffer tolerance values (PBTVs) in both +/- X and +/- Y
   directions. A new Python toolbox for ArcGIS was developed to automate
   the introduced method. A set of evaluation metrics-(i) producer accuracy
   (PA), (ii) user accuracy (UA), (iii) F-score (F), and (iv) Cohen's kappa
   index (KI)-were computed to evaluate the accuracy of the horizontal
   matching between channel networks/orders extracted from global DEMs and
   those derived from LiDAR DTMs and DSMs. PALSAR DEM 12.5 m ranked first
   among the other global DEMs with the lowest root mean square error
   (RMSE) and mean difference (MD) values of 4.57 m and 0.78 m,
   respectively, when compared to the LiDAR DTM 12.5 m. The ALOS DSM 28.5 m
   had the highest vertical accuracy with the lowest recorded RMSE and MD
   values of 4.01 m and -0.29 m, respectively, when compared to the LiDAR
   DSM 28.5 m. PALSAR DEM 12.5 m and ALOS DSM 28.5 m-derived channel
   networks/orders yielded the highest horizontal accuracy when compared to
   those delineated from LiDAR DTM 12.5 m and LiDAR DSM 28.5 m,
   respectively. The number of unmatched channels decreased when the PBTV
   increased from 0 to 3 pixels using different ATs.}},

Abstract = {{With ongoing urbanization and climate change our cities are continuously
   becoming warmer and susceptible to flash flooding. A wide array of green
   infrastructure including urban trees is getting attention to mitigate
   those problems; however, magnitude, patterns and processes of
   hydrological functional capacity of different tree species at
   micro-scales are largely unknown. We measured morphology, above and
   below ground growth of two ecologically contrasting street tree species
   at two streets in Munich, Germany: Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Tilia
   cordata Mill. during 2016-17. Additionally, tree transpiration,
   meteorological and edaphic variables including soil hydraulic
   conductivity was measured on two streets. Overall the soil physical
   properties including bulk density, particle size distribution and
   meteorological variables were not significantly different at the two
   sites. A higher soil infiltration rate (0.42 cm/min) under the canopies
   of R. pseudoacacia compared to the T. cordata (0.29 cm/min) was mainly
   attributed to the higher annual growth rate of R. pseudoacacia and
   showed a significant correlation (r = 0.62) with infiltration rate.
   Subsequently, R. pseudoacacia showed increased fine root biomass
   compared to T. cordata (121 g/m(2 )and 27 g/m(2) respectively). However,
   T. cordata trees transpired three times more compared to R. pseudoacacia
   which indicated that they might have a deeper roofing system. The study
   showed that fast growing species such as R. pseudoacacia can enhance
   infiltration through its intense fine roofing system creating channels
   in the upper soil. Moreover, grass cover also plays a role both in
   infiltration and ground evapotranspiration compared to the built
   surfaces and can enhance the processes if planted in combination with
   less water using species. Secondly, higher root biomass and infiltration
   further away from the tree trunk suggest a need for larger tree planting
   pits whereas species such as T. cordata are better suited in paved
   cutout pits inducing vertical roofing depth.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an overview on the risk assessment approaches for

   characteristics: (i) from regional to local, and (ii) from qualification
   to quantification. The Guangzhou Metro System is used to demonstrate the
   application of the perspective methods for flood risk assessment of
   metro system. The risk prevention procedure uses an iterative cycle that
   includes risk assessment, precaution, prediction, and technical

Abstract = {{Intense rainfall-runoff events and subsequent soil erosion can cause
   serious damage to the infrastructure in residential areas in Europe
   countries and all over the world. In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of
   the Interior has supported an analysis dealing with the risks to
   residents, infrastructure, and water bodies from flash floods and
   sediment transport. A total of more than 150,000 risk points were
   identified by GIS morphology and land-use analysis. The threat, the
   vulnerability, and the resulting risk category were determined for each
   of these points. The WaTEM/SEDEM model was used to assess the threat
   with 10-m data resolution. The summarized vulnerability of real objects
   on individual runoff trajectories was combined with the threat of
   sediment transport, resulting in the overall risk represented by a
   5-degree scale, from lowest (1) to highest (5). The output of the
   project lies stored in the WEB application. Nineteen percent of the
   sites in the Czech Republic, i.e., more than 23,000 sites, have been
   assigned to categories 4 and 5, with a high level of risk. Thirty-four
   percent of cadastral units are classified as the high risky (4416
   cadasters, with a total area 24,707km(2)). Approximately 30\% of the
   population of the Czech Republic lives in high-risk cadastral areas.
   Four scenarios of protection were modeled. To reduce the high-risk and
   very high-risk sites (categories 4 and 5), the most effective solution
   is the implementation of technical measures or conversion to grassland
   within the contributing watersheds. This could reduce the number of
   high-risk sites from 23,400 to 3700.Methods of sediment transport
   modeling and risk evaluation, based on presented USLE input data and
   documented WaTEM/SEDEM model, can be used worldwide. Especially in
   post-soviet union countries with shared arable land development and
   erosion consequences.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of artificial floods for benthic community recovery after
   sediment flushing from a dam}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{191}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The number of dams is predicted to increase worldwide under the current
   global change scenario. A major environmental problem associated with
   dams is the release of large quantities of fine sediment downstream.
   Therefore, future studies in river conservation will largely be focused
   on the management of sediments trapped by reservoirs. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the downstream ecological impacts of sediment
   flushing from a dam and the effectiveness of artificial flash floods as
   a recovery strategy. Artificial flash floods have often been employed to
   remove large amounts of sediment from riverbeds, but their importance in
   improving the biological quality of lotic environments is almost
   unknown. We carried out a series of quantitative macroinvertebrate
   samplings over a 2-year period that started before sediment release and
   included the artificial flushing events. We characterized the
   macroinvertebrate community in its structural and functional aspects and
   tested the performance of two biomonitoring indexes, comparing their
   diagnostic ability. Our results demonstrated that sediment flushing
   significantly altered the structure and composition of benthic
   communities for more than 1year. Flash floods exacerbated the overall
   biological quality, but we believe that this treatment was useful
   because, by removing large amounts of sediment, the biological recovery
   process was accelerated. Finally, regarding the water quality
   assessment, we found that the biomonitoring index for siltation,
   composed of a selection of taxonomical and functional metrics, was more
   reliable than the generic one.}},

Abstract = {{More than 10 Sub1 rice varieties carrying the submergence-tolerance gene
   have been released for flood-prone environments in tropical Asia.
   Improved management practices have been shown to enhance yields of these
   varieties. The objective of this study was to dissect the growth
   response of IR64-Sub1 to integrated crop management in a flash flood at
   the late vegetative stage. Field experiments were conducted at the
   International Rice Research Institute, Philippines in the dry and wet
   seasons of 2013. Complete submergence was imposed for 14 days starting
   at 37 days after transplanting. Integrated management practice (IMP)
   consisting of: (i) application of fertilizer (compared with no
   fertilizer use in conventional practice), (ii) use of lower seeding rate
   (400 vs. 800 kg ha(-1)) in the nursery bed, (iii) use of slightly older
   seedling for transplanting (30 vs. 18 day-old), and (iv) higher planting
   density (33.3 vs. 25.0 hills m(-2)) gave yields higher by 8-87\%
   compared with the conventional practice (1.3-2.4 t ha(-1)) in both
   seasons. This was attributable to higher shoot biomass after water
   recession, more tillers m(-2), greater leaf area expansion and shoot
   biomass accumulation during the recovery period, and higher filled-grain
   percentage at maturity. The improved management had no positive effect
   on panicle formation, spikelets panicle(-1), and harvest index since
   stress was imposed at the transition period between vegetative and
   reproductive phases. Our results suggest the appropriate nursery
   management, for submergence-resilient seedlings to further alleviate
   damage caused by flash floods and increase the yield of Sub1 varieties
   in flood-prone rainfed lowlands.}},

Abstract = {{Flooding can cause damage to infrastructure and has a devastating impact
   on daily life. Malaysia is located in a tropical region characterized by
   high quantity of rainfall. Damaged roads due to flooding prevent access
   for emergency and assistance purpose. The purpose of this study is to
   identify the flooding characteristics of inundated roads in Malaysia. It
   includes the parameters of flood water level, flood duration, and
   repeated flooding. Secondary data from relevant departments and agencies
   are gathered for the analysis. Flood statistics were obtained from the
   annual flood reports issued by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage
   Malaysia between 1991 and 2014. Road data as well as maps were collected
   from the Highway Planning Division, Ministry of Works Malaysia. In this
   study, flash flood was defined as flood that subsides in less than 6 hr.
   The study revealed that the average flood depths could be grouped into
   0.3 m, 0.6 m and 1.0 m depths. However, in areas under tidal effect, the
   depths could exceed 1.0 m and it took longer for the flood to subside,
   up to two days. The result of this characterisation will be used to
   expand the study on the effect of inundated roads during flooding on the
   whole road structural system.}},

   simultaneous occurrence of two types of hazard: torrential rain and
   damages to the supply water system network. Therefore we will use an
   ArcGIS procedure of building flash-floods scenarios generated by extreme
   events, namely the high level of soil saturation, damages to the supply
   water system network and a high intensity torrential rain. The article
   presents different scenarios according to the return period (T) of the
   torrential rain: T=20 years, T=100 years and T=1000 years. The results
   will highlight the several vulnerability categories of the terrain and

Abstract = {{There is a visible paradigm shift in disaster research from hazard and
   vulnerability assessment to developing framework for community
   resilience. Further, there is growing recognization in disaster science
   to develop framework to build resilience of the communities prone to
   natural hazards as highlighted by Sendai Framework for DRR 2015-2030.
   Again, community resilience especially early warning solution for Flash
   Floods, Debris flow and Land-slides in mountainous region of Afghanistan
   has escaped investigation and analysis. The objective of this paper is
   to explore the framework of existing monitoring/early warning systems
   (EWS) for landslides, mudslides and flood in selected villages/districts
   of district Badakhshan province. The framework is based on household
   questionnaire survey among 144respondents selected through purposive
   sampling method. The Climate-related Disaster Community Resilience
   Framework (CDCRF) revealed that there diminishing resilience culture
   among the communities in conflict prone area of Badakhshan Mountain.
   However, despite their exposure to the climate induced extreme events,
   the community has not been able to develop their coping capacity. It has
   also been observer that the primary reason for diminishing resilience
   culture among communities, lack of public accesses to science based
   information, degradation of indigenous knowledge on hazard, gendered
   livelihood transformation and limited adaptive capacity. The paper has
   proposed a new framework of Early Warning Solution for Flash Floods,
   Debris flow and Land-slides, which has wider implication for disaster
   management and emergency planning in the mountains of conflict prone

Abstract = {{On November 15, 2017, a high intensity convective storm, reaching 300 mm
   in 13 h in the core zone of the event, hit the western part of the
   region of Attica in Greece, causing a catastrophic flash flood in the
   town of Mandra and a tragic loss of 24 people, making it the most deadly
   flood in the country, in a period of 40 years.
   The research team surveyed the area during and after the flood using a
   combination of systematic ground and aerial observations with the aid of
   an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aiming to reconstruct the basic
   physical and hydrological characteristics of the flood and its impacts.
   The analysis produced detailed flood extent and depth maps that provided
   a comprehensive description of the physical characteristics of
   floodwaters across the inundated area. Peak discharge was estimated,
   using a UAV-derived digital surface model, at two locations,
   corresponding to the two main tributaries and indicated an impressive
   hydrological response, between 9 and 10 m(3)/s/km(2). Impact analysis on
   the basis of these observations showed an extensive diversity, including
   effects in geomorphology, vegetation, buildings, infrastructure and
   human population.
   Analysis of meteorological, botanical and geomorphological evidence lead
   to the conclusion that this flash flood was a very rare event.
   Results demonstrate that the combination of aerial and ground
   observations allow an enhanced and holistic reconstruction of a flash
   flood and its impacts with high accuracy, leading to the conclusion that
   the approach used has a significant potential in many aspects of flood
   disaster investigations.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{In August 2010, Leh district in the Ladakh region of north-western India
   experienced a disaster when a cloudburst generated debris flows, killed
   hundreds of people, destroyed houses, and damaged the hospital,
   communication infrastructure, the bus station, and vital roads. A
   simulation of the Leh cloudburst disaster analysed the disaster itself,
   disaster risk reduction plans in the region, gaps in existing response
   mechanisms and reducing hazard impacts in the future. The participant
   group comprised academic researchers and industry experts in natural
   hazards, social vulnerability, engineering, historical and social
   sciences, education, journalism, disaster management and disaster risk
   reduction. Many of the participants had extensive local knowledge of
   Ladakh or comparable neighbouring Himalayan regions. Following the
   disaster, Leh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC), produced a
   District Disaster Management Plan (DDMP), which addressed many of the
   gaps identified in the simulation. Most importantly, the document
   outlined a civil protection mechanism to respond to future hazardous
   events. This was utilised to assess future disaster response in the
   simulation scenario. From analysis of the scenario simulation, the role
   of the army was found to be key in minimizing the impact of the 2010
   disaster, although in the future, the army may coordinate with the civil
   protection body as set out in the DDMP. Participants identified the lack
   of a local formalized civil protection plan as a major vulnerability,
   and the most vulnerable populations as the migrant communities. The
   group also discussed evidence of resilience among the population such as
   the role of monasteries and spirituality in psychological recovery and
   the impact of the initial local response. From broader discussion of the
   simulation scenario, it was possible to identify aspects of resilience
   for further study in a wider research project, such as identifying
   hazardous slopes from satellite mapping, informing the fieldwork
   program, designing social questionnaires to understand risk perception
   and formulating questions to guide focus-group discussions on community
   resilience.}},

Abstract = {{High-impact weather events over sparse data regions with complex
   orography, such as the Mediterranean region, remain a challenge for
   numerical weather prediction. This study evaluates, for the first time,
   the ability of a multiscale ensemble-based data assimilation system to
   reproduce a heavy precipitation episode that occurred during the first
   Special Observation Period (SOP1) of the Hydrological cycle in the
   Mediterranean Experiment (HyMeX). During the Intense Observation Period
   (IOP13) from 14 to 15 October 2012, convective maritime activity
   associated with an advancing cold front affected coastal areas of
   southern France, Corsica and Italy. With the main objective of improving
   forecasts of this weather event, a data assimilation (DA) system using
   the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm is implemented. The
   potential impact of assimilating conventional in situ observations
   (METAR, aircrafts, buoys and rawinsondes) and single-Doppler
   reflectivity data to improve numerical representation of growing
   convective maritime structures that will evolve towards coastal
   populated areas is evaluated. Results indicate that information provided
   by both observation sources contribute to initiation and subsequent
   evolution of convective structures not captured by the conventional
   runs. Notably, data assimilation experiments produce the best
   quantitative verification scores for the short range (6-8 h) forecasts
   of accumulated precipitation. Beyond 6-8 h, data assimilation
   experiments and those without data assimilation are indistinguishable.
   Sensitivity experiments, evaluating the impact of increasing the length
   of the radar data assimilation period, reveal the importance of
   assimilating high-frequency reflectivity data during a mid-term period
   (6 h approx.) to better depict deep convective structures initiated over
   the sea that evolve towards populated coastal areas.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Connected vehicles are poised to transform the field of environmental
   sensing by enabling acquisition of scientific data at unprecedented
   scales. Drawing on a real-world dataset collected from almost 70
   connected vehicles, this study generates improved rainfall estimates by
   combining weather radar with windshield wiper observations. Existing
   methods for measuring precipitation are subject to spatial and temporal
   uncertainties that compromise high-precision applications like flash
   flood forecasting. Windshield wiper measurements from connected vehicles
   correct these uncertainties by providing precise information about the
   timing and location of rainfall. Using co-located vehicle dashboard
   camera footage, we find that wiper measurements are a stronger predictor
   of binary rainfall state than traditional stationary gages or
   radar-based measurements. We introduce a Bayesian filtering framework
   that generates improved rainfall estimates by updating radar rainfall
   fields with windshield wiper observations. We find that the resulting
   rainfall field estimate captures rainfall events that would otherwise be
   missed by conventional measurements. We discuss how these enhanced
   rainfall maps can be used to improve flood warnings and facilitate
   real-time operation of stormwater infrastructure.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{225-237}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of spatio-temporal rainfall patterns is required as input for
   distributed hydrologic models used for tasks such as flood runoff
   estimation and modelling. Normally, these patterns are generated from
   point observations on the ground using spatial interpolation methods.
   However, such methods fail in reproducing the true spatio-temporal
   rainfall pattern, especially in data-scarce regions with poorly gauged
   catchments, or for highly dynamic, small-scale rainstorms which are not
   well recorded by existing monitoring networks. Consequently,
   uncertainties arise in distributed rainfall-runoff modelling if poorly
   identified spatio-temporal rainfall patterns are used, since the amount
   of rainfall received by a catchment as well as the dynamics of the
   runoff generation of flood waves is underestimated. To address this
   problem we propose an inverse hydrologic modelling approach for
   stochastic reconstruction of spatio-temporal rainfall patterns. The
   methodology combines the stochastic random field simulator Random Mixing
   and a distributed rainfall-runoff model in a Monte Carlo framework. The
   simulated spatio-temporal rainfall patterns are conditioned on point
   rainfall data from ground-based monitoring networks and the observed
   hydrograph at the catchment outlet and aim to explain measured data at
   best. Since we infer a three-dimensional input variable from an integral
   catchment response, several candidates for spatio-temporal rainfall
   patterns are feasible and allow for an analysis of their uncertainty.
   The methodology is tested on a synthetic rainfall-runoff event on
   sub-daily time steps and spatial resolution of 1 km(2) for a catchment
   partly covered by rainfall. A set of plausible spatio-temporal rainfall
   patterns can be obtained real-world study for a flash flood event in a
   mountainous arid region are presented. They underline that knowledge
   about the spatio-temporal rainfall pattern is crucial for flash flood
   modelling even in small catchments and arid and semiarid environments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the precipitation types and background physical
   mechanisms of extreme precipitation events (EPEs) over western Turkey
   during the period 2006-2015. The EPEs are described as the precipitation
   values above the 90th percentile obtained from the hourly precipitation
   dataset, which has high spatial resolution. Precipitation types
   associated with EPEs are identified by using radar outputs and the Lamb
   weather type (LWT) approach. It is found that EPEs occurred more
   frequently in the Marmara and Aegean regions during autumn and winter
   months. In Marmara, mainly 21 \%, 17 \%, and 15 \% of total autumn EPEs
   show convective, cyclonic, and sea-effect precipitation characteristics,
   respectively. While convective EPEs are seen more commonly in the
   southern portions, cyclonic and sea-effect-originated EPEs mainly affect
   the southwest and northeastern parts of Marmara. Among these three
   precipitation types, convective mechanisms generally produce more
   intense daily precipitation (66 1 mm on average) in the Marmara Region
   under the proper synoptic conditions (highpressure center over the
   Balkan Peninsula and low-pressure center over the eastern
   Mediterranean). Based on the hourly observations, convective types of
   extreme precipitation (EP) show two peak values during afternoon and
   evening times of the day and are linked to diurnal heating. In terms of
   the Aegean Region, cyclone-originated EP, which includes 65 \% of the
   total winter EPEs, is more common in the whole territory and reaches its
   peak value during the early hours of the day.}},

Title = {{A spatial multicriteria prioritizing approach for geo-hydrological risk
   mitigation planning in small and densely urbanized Mediterranean basins}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{Landslides and floods, particularly flash floods, occurred recently in
   many Mediterranean catchments as a consequence of heavy rainfall events,
   causing damage and sometimes casualties. The high hazard is often
   associated with high vulnerability deriving from intense urbanization,
   in particular along the coastline where streams are habitually
   culverted. The necessary risk mitigation strategies should be applied at
   the catchment scale with a holistic approach, avoiding spot
   interventions.
   In the present work, a high-risk area, hit in the past by several floods
   and concurrent superficial landslides due to extremely localized and
   intense rain events, has been studied. A total of 21 small catchments
   have been identified: only some of them have been hit by extremely
   damaging past events, but all lie in the intense-rain high-hazard area
   and are strongly urbanized in the lower coastal zone. The question is
   what would happen if an intense rain event should strike one of the not
   previously hit catchments; some situations could be worse or not, so
   attention has been focused on the comparison among catchments. The aim
   of the research has been identifying a priority scale among catchments,
   pointing out the more critical ones and giving a quantitative comparison
   tool for decision makers to support strong scheduling of long-time
   planning interventions at the catchment scale. The past events' effects
   and the geomorphic process analysis together with the field survey
   allowed us to select three sets of parameters: one describing the
   morphometric- morphological features related to flood and landslide
   hazard, another describing the degree of urbanization and of
   anthropogenic modifications at the catchment scale and the last related
   to the elements that are exposed to risk. The realized geodatabase
   allowed us to apply the spatial multicriteria analysis technique (S-MCA)
   to the descriptive parameters and to obtain a priority scale among the
   analyzed catchments. The scale can be used to plan risk mitigation
   interventions starting from the more critical catchments, then focusing
   economic resources primarily on them and obtaining an effective
   prevention strategy. The methodology could be useful even to check how
   the priority scale is modified during the progress of the mitigation
   work realization.
   In addition, this approach could be applied in a similar context, even
   among sub-catchments, after identifying a suitable set of descriptive
   parameters depending on the active geomorphological processes and the
   kind of anthropogenic modification. The prioritization would allow to
   invest economic resources in risk mitigation interventions priory in the
   more critical catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Flash floods evolve rapidly during and after heavy precipitation events
   and represent a potential risk for society. To predict the timing and
   magnitude of a peak runoff, it is common to couple meteorological and
   hydrological models in a forecasting chain. However, hydrological models
   rely on strong simplifying assumptions and hence need to be calibrated.
   This makes their application difficult in catchments where no direct
   observation of runoff is available.
   To address this gap, a flash-flood forecasting chain is presented based
   on (i) a nowcasting product which combines radar and rain gauge rainfall
   data (CombiPrecip); (ii) meteorological data from state-of-the-art
   numerical weather prediction models (COSMO-1, COSMO-E); (iii)
   operationally available soil moisture estimations from the PREVAH
   hydrological model; and (iv) a process-based runoff generation module
   with no need for calibration (RGM-PRO). This last component uses
   information on the spatial distribution of dominant runoff processes
   from the so-called maps of runoff types, which can be derived with
   different mapping approaches with increasing involvement of expert
   knowledge. RGM-PRO is event-based and parametrised a priori based on the
   results of sprinkling experiments.
   This prediction chain has been evaluated using data from April to
   September 2016 in the Emme catchment, a medium-sized flash-flood-prone
   basin in the Swiss Prealps. Two novel forecasting chains were set up
   with two different maps of runoff types, which allowed sensitivity of
   the forecast performance to the mapping approaches to be analysed.
   Furthermore, special emphasis was placed on the predictive power of the
   new forecasting chains in nested subcatchments when compared with a
   prediction chain including an original version of the runoff generation
   module of PREVAH calibrated for one event.
   Results showed a low sensitivity of the predictive power to the amount
   of expert knowledge included for the mapping approach. The forecasting
   chain including a map of runoff types with high involvement of expert
   knowledge did not guarantee more skill. In the larger basins of the Emme
   region, process-based forecasting chains revealed comparable skill to a
   prediction system including a conventional hydrological model. In the
   small nested subcatchments, although the process-based forecasting
   chains outperformed the original runoff generation module, no
   forecasting chain showed satisfying skill in the sense that it could be
   useful for decision makers.
   Despite the short period available for evaluation, preliminary outcomes
   of this study show that operational flash-flood predictions in ungauged
   basins can benefit from the use of information on runoff processes, as
   no long-term runoff measurements are needed for calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood, one of the most devastating weather-related hazards in the
   world, has become more and more frequent in past decades. For the
   purpose of flood mitigation, it is necessary to understand the

   (Least squares support vector machine: LSSVM) and classical canonical
   method (Logistic regression: LR) are used to assess the flash flood risk
   in the Yunnan Province based on historical flash flood records and 13
   meteorological, topographical, hydrological and anthropological factors.
   Results indicate that: (1) the LSSVM with Radial basis function (RBF)
   Kernel works the best (Accuracy = 0.79) and the LR is the worst
   (Accuracy = 0.75) in testing; (2) flash flood risk distribution
   identified by the LSSVM in Yunnan province is near normal distribution;
   (3) the high-risk areas are mainly concentrated in the central and
   southeastern regions, where with a large curve number; and (4) the
   impact factors contributing the flash flood risk map from higher to low

Abstract = {{Schools and students are particularly vulnerable to natural hazards,
   especially pluvial flooding in cities. This paper presents a
   scenario-based study that assesses the school vulnerability of emergency
   services (i.e., Emergency Medical Service and Fire \& Rescue Service) to
   urban pluvial flooding in the city center of Shanghai, China through the
   combination of flood hazard analysis and GIS-based accessibility
   mapping. Emergency coverages and response times in various traffic
   conditions are quantified to generate school vulnerability under normal
   no-flood and 100-y pluvial flood scenarios. The findings indicate that
   severe pluvial flooding could lead to proportionate and linear impacts
   on emergency response provision to schools in the city. Only 11\% of all
   the schools is predicted to be completely unreachable (very high
   vulnerability) during flood emergency but the majority of the schools
   would experience significant delay in the travel times of emergency
   responses. In this case, appropriate adaptations need to be particularly
   targeted for specific hot-spot areas (e.g., new urbanized zones) and
   crunch times (e.g., rush hours).}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a multidisciplinary study of the
   impact of climate change during the Little Ice Age on a medieval village

   land sealed beneath the debris, and considering the social and economic
   implications of the event in the subsequent history of the area. First,
   a series of test pits was excavated within the area of the modern
   village to map the full extent of the damage. Following this, analysis
   of the stratigraphy, architectural remains, datable artefacts and
   radiocarbon dating contributed further details, while historical
   evidence revealed the privatisation of the agricultural land following
   the catastrophe. The findings offer a snapshot of climate change and its
   social contexts in a specific, under-studied area with possible
   implications for the study of risk behaviour and disaster response in
   currently inhabited areas.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of the urban space tends to produce an impermeable
   cover on the ground that hampers rainwater infiltration. Therefore,
   drainage infrastructure should compensate. By blocking rainwater
   infiltration in the soil, surface runoff is increased and, consequently,
   the threats of inundation, flooding and flash flood, triggered by
   hydrological events, are potentiated. However, it is possible to promote
   the integration of basic infrastructure of a city, enhancing it. As an
   example, there is the use of non-motorized urban mobility
   infrastructure, such as sidewalk and bicycle lane for the application of
   sustainable urban drainage techniques. The objective of this study is to
   identify the type and extent of the coverings of public spaces that
   support the non-motorized mobility present in the lower section of the
   da Velha river basin in the city of Blumenau, state of Santa Catarina,
   Brazil, in order to evaluate the composition of these areas. A case
   study with a qualitative-quantitative nature was carried out. A total of
   218,816.77 m(2) of structure was quantified for non-motorized mobility
   in arterial roads, collectors and circulation areas in parks of the
   lower section of the river basin, consisting mainly of cementitious base
   materials. The most common three types of coatings were interlocked
   pavements (41.47\%), inloco molded concrete (21.75\%), and hydraulic
   tile (13.57\%). Such constructed areas can be adapted to compose an
   Urban Sustainable Drainage System, whose techniques allow the
   infiltration of water in the soil, reducing the interferences in the
   natural water cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Constructed on the Tigris River, Mosul dam is the most important
   hydraulic structure in Iraq, as well is the most dangerous dam in the
   world. Its geological foundation is unstable due to alternate and
   variable soluble strata formed from materials such as gypsum, anhydrite,
   marl and limestone. Consequently, it could collapse at any time and the
   lives of at least 1.5 million people could be at risk. The present paper
   investigate the flash-flood scenario due to a hypothetical disaster
   failure of Mosul dam using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River
   Analysis System (HEC-RAS) in concert with HEC-GeoRAS and ArcGIS. The
   Landsat-OLI image and SRTM-V4.1 DEM data were exploited to digitize the
   river line, banks, path, and elevation. The cross sections over the
   river was created based on HEC-GeoRAS model to simulate the spreading of
   the dam-break flood after the flood-wave exits the narrow valley towards
   the city of Mosul and its neighbourhood. The 3D and spatial analysts in
   ArcGIS were applied to create water surface and the depth raster layer
   for the flash flood scenario. The results revealed that the flow depths
   can reach a 110 m by reference to bed of the river (or 32 m compared to
   the topographic surface), covering the Mosul city and extent situated at
   75 km downstream of the Dam and sweeping an area about 30 km wide within
   few hours. The visual impact of this theoretical flood propagation was
   represented in 3D for land planning and a strategic plan preparation to
   protect and reduce the potential impact on human life, infrastructure,
   and environment in Mosul dam watersheds and adjacent regions.}},

Title = {{Terminus lakes on the south side of Vatnajokull ice cap, SE-Iceland}},
Journal = {{JOKULL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{1-34}},
Abstract = {{Many ice-marginal lakes have formed in front of glacier termini in
   Iceland in recent decades due to climate warming, particularly at the
   southern margin of Vatnajokull ice cap where several such lakes grow
   year-by-year at present. At the same time, most glacier-dammed lakes at
   the lateral ice margins have shrunk or disappeared because of glacier
   thinning, and jokulhlaups released from them have become smaller. This
   paper describes changes in glacial lakes in SE-Iceland, from
   Skeiararjokull west of Oroefi to Hoffellsjokull in Hornafjorour. Lakes
   started to form in front of several glaciers in this area in the 1930s
   but most did not grow much until the 1990s, except for Jokulsarlon by
   Breioamerkurjokull, which has grown steadily since before-the middle of
   the last century. Currently, there are growing terminus lakes by all the
   main south flowing outlet glaciers of Vatnajokull, with a combined area
   of similar to 60 km(2). The subglacial landscape upstream of the termini
   indicates that the lakes will continue to grow in the coming decades as
   a consequence of glacier downwasting if the climate warms as projected.
   These lakes affect the ice flow and the mass and energy balance of the
   respective glaciers because of their effect on the force balance of the
   terminus region, the calving of ice into the lakes, and the absorption
   of heat spent for melting of calved ice fragments and the terminus ice
   front. The lakes can cause hazard to settlements and travellers in the
   adjacent area, as landslides on the glaciers that propagate into the
   lakes can create tsunami waves with a high run-up and sudden, very
   dangerous flash floods in the glacier forelands.}},

Abstract = {{Northern Punjab region of Pakistan, known as Potohar region comprises
   2.26 (Million IIectre) of rich land with mean annual rainfall varying
   from 400 mm to 1400 mm that has high runoff potential. Climate of this
   region is affected by variation in rainfall frequency, flash floods and
   long dry periods. The increasing gap in water supply and demand put huge
   stress on already scarce water resources. Considering the potential of
   rainwater harvesting in Potohar, the Government has been subsidizing
   rainwater harvesting projects since 1980's. Given the historical
   uncertainties of climate, importance of rainwater harvesting is
   increased fur it being a must feasible climate change adaptation option.
   Rainwater harvesting is evaluated as climate change adaptation option by
   performing cost benefit analysis and cost effectiveness analysis. A
   total 400 farming families were reviewed in this research that were
   reported to have benefitted from subsidized rainwater harvesting
   projects. For this research, 21 farmers and farms were surveyed and
   their cases were collected across the Potohar region. Findings of this
   research have revealed that, 60\% of the surveyed farmers have higher
   understanding of climate change and they arc willing to add value into
   their farming practice to increase their income, while 67\% of farmers
   recognized that Potohar region has high potential for rainwater
   harvesting. Older dams had higher income and showed higher benefit cost
   ratio, on the other hand dams constructed during last two years have
   shown marginal to lower benefits. Overall economic benefits and
   effectiveness had established rainwater harvesting as suitable climate
   change adaptation option.}},

Abstract = {{Aim of work is to investigate the influence of the Precarpathian bend
   and the Volynian-Podolian upland for the nature of displacement of the
   Dnister River tributaries and to determine stability of river channels.
   The object of this research is the Dnister River and its left and right
   tributaries. Considering the main factors influencing the nature of the
   horizontal riverbed displacements caused by both natural and
   anthropogenic factors, special attention is focused on the geological
   structures in the area on which Dnister River and its tributaries flow.
   Methods. Applying the software package ArcGIS authors had implemented
   the monitoring for a 100 year period using various topographical,
   geological, ground maps, and space images. For monitoring of
   displacements of the riverbeds of right and left bank tributaries of the
   Dnister there were used: topographic maps at scales 1:100000 and 1:75000
   (Austrian period - 1886, 1910, Polish period -1930, the Soviet period -
   1985, 1989); space images Landsat 7 (2000), Landsat 8 (2014) and
   Sentinel 2 (2016, 2017); and soil map scale 1:200000. It allows
   declaration about the different nature of the displacements. Results.
   The Dnister River flows on the border of two structures - the
   Precarpathian bend and the Volynian-Podolian upland. The right bank
   tributaries (Bystrytsia, Limnytsia, Stryi, and others) that begin in the
   Carpathians, cross the outer and inner boundaries of the Precarpathian
   bend, and are characterized by riverbed stability in the mountainous
   part, with multithreading and considerable meandering (especially for
   the Stryi River) within the Precarpathian bend. Lithological deposits
   have a significant influence at the mouth of the Stryi River. For these
   tributaries, according to the results of the study, large horizontal
   displacements are observed, they extend for: Limnytsia river - 500 m,
   Bystrytsia river - 580 m, Stryi River - 1200 m. The left bank
   tributaries, which are located on the Volynian-Podolian upland, include
   Zolota Lypa, Seret, Zbruch, Smotrych, and Strypa rivers. They are highly
   sinuos but much more stable in horizontal displacements. The maximum
   displacements for these rivers are 300-380 m. Scientific novelty.
   Investigation includes the influence of geological structures on the
   displacements of the left and right bank tributaries of the Dnister
   River and an analysis of the basic mathematical expressions that are
   used to evaluate the stability of the riverbeds. The practical
   significance. The results of monitoring riverbed deformation processes
   have to be considered while solving tasks related to riverbed processes,
   namely for: development and building of hydraulic engineering
   facilities, design of power transmission network when crossing rivers,
   development of gas transmission pipelines, determination of flood hazard
   zones and consequences of destruction after flash floods or seasonal
   floods, establishment of boundaries of land conservation areas,
   management of recreation activities, monitoring of the condition of
   frontier lands, and establishment of the border along the midstream of
   rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Aim of the study
   The current paper aims to give a detailed evaluation and analysis of
   some extreme rainfall events that happened in the last decade in terms
   of spatial and temporal rainfall distribution, intensity rate, and
   exceedance probability. Moreover, it examines the effects of each
   analysed aspect on the resulting flash floods in the studied area.
   Material and methods
   In their glossary of meteorology, American Meteorology Society (AMS)
   subdivided rainfall intensity types into four groups (light, moderate,
   heavy, and violent). Also, for estimating the exceedance probability,
   log-normal distribution was applied as a statistical model of the
   precipitation probability distribution function.
   Results and conclusions
   Out of six episodes, five of the analysed events were classified as
   heavy rainfall. However, the duration of those heavy rainfall events was
   not more than two hours. Four events of maximum daily rainfall (for a
   39-year dataset) were rated at 1-10\% of exceedance probability. To
   conclude, the current study can be an initial step in modelling
   hydrological events in the studied area, and in the process of
   transforming precipitation into the outflows of urban basins in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood in small catchments of hilly area is an extremely
   complicated nonlinear process affected by catchment properties and
   rainfall spatio-temporal variation characteristics including many
   physical-geographical factors, and thus accurate simulation of flash
   flood is very difficult. Given the fact that hundreds of hydrological
   models are available in the literature, how to choose a suitable
   hydrological model remains an unsolved task. In this paper, we selected
   five widely used hydrological models including three lumped hydrologic
   models, a semi-distributed hydrological model and a distributed
   hydrological model for flash flood simulation, and studied their
   applicability in fourteen typical catchments in hilly areas across
   China. The results show that the HEC-HMS distributed hydrological model
   outperforms the other models and is suitable to simulate the flash
   floods caused by highly intense rainfall. The Dahuofang model (lumped)
   has higher precision in peak runoff time simulation. However, its
   performance is quite poor on the flood volume simulation in the small
   catchments characterized by intense vegetation coverage and highly
   developed stream network. The Antecedent precipitation index and
   Xinanjiang models (lumped) can obtain good simulation results in small
   humid catchments as long as long-term historical precipitation and
   runoff data are provided. The TOPMODEL also shows good performance in
   small humid catchments, but it is unable to simulate the flash floods
   characterized by the rapid rise and recession. Our results could be very
   beneficial in practice, since these provide a solid foundation in the
   selection of hydrological model for flash flood simulation in small
   catchments in hilly area.}},

Abstract = {{Countries such as Saudi Arabia are experiencing island heat effect due
   to large consumption of fossil fuels. The ambient temperature in the
   cities of Saudi Arabia is increasing faster than the global average due
   to this effect. The recorded temperature over the past decade has shown
   an anomalous increase of 0.76 C (IEA, 2013b, Almazroui et al., 2012).
   Besides such temperature anomalies, Saudi Arabia experiencing flash
   floods in the recent past. All such abnormal weather pattern is
   apparently attributed to the large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions from domestic and industrial sectors. With the country having
   greater than 3000 CDD (Cooling Degree Days), more than 80\% fossil fuel
   energy (192 TWh) is spent for space cooling (IEA, 2013, a,b) and by the
   year 2020 this quantity is expected to exceed 605 TWh (EIA, 2013). The
   per capita electricity consumption is crossing 8500 kWh (WB, 2012, IEA,
   2012). Nearly 446000 Gg of CO2 is being emitted from fossil fuel
   combustion, while CO2 emissions from electricity and heat production is
   of the order of 181000 Gg. Manufacturing industries also emit similar
   amount of CO2. Apparently the micro-weather anomalies are caused due to
   such large CO2 emissions. The country however has options to implement
   CDM (clean development mechanism) by reducing CO2 emissions and
   stabilize its micro-weather anomalies by using hydrothermal and hot dry
   rock resources (EGS). The country's EGS potential is enormous compared
   to hydrothermal resources (Fig. 1). High heat generating granites in the
   Arabian shield occupy an area of about 161 500 km(2) and the heat
   generating capacity of the granites vary from 8 to 134 mu W/m(3). These
   granites are under severe NE-SW Compressional regime due to the active
   Red Sea mid ocean ridge. Thus these granites are the best candidates to
   initiate EGS projects. Experimental investigation to understand the
   fracture propagation under confined stress conditions are in progress.}},

   the flood risk management plan strategy. The hydrographic basin of

Abstract = {{Flash flood is one of the most significant natural disasters in China,
   particularly in mountainous area, causing heavy economic damage and
   casualties of life. For numerous small hilly basins that need flash
   flood prevention and control with limited funds, it is necessary to give
   a priority order or to determine which basin needs to be harnessed
   firstly. Flash flood risk assessment is critical to an efficient flash
   flood management. Among many flash flood risk evaluation methods in
   literatures, variable fuzzy method (VFM) was chosen in this paper. To
   verify the results of VFM, fuzzy clustering analysis (FCA) is also used.
   First, taking Licheng county with 119 small basins in China as an
   example, 9 indexes were identified among index system, based on
   disaster-breeding environment (or underlying surface conditions) of
   small basin in hilly region. Risk levels are divided into three grading
   levels such as high, medium and low. Second, VFM was introduced, and the
   flash flood risk grade eigenvalue (H) of each small basin was
   calculated. The results show that no small basin belongs to high risk
   level, 14 basins belong to low risk level, and the remaining 105 small
   basins belong to medium risk level. Third, FCA was used to verify the
   result of VFM. The results of two methods show that they are nearly in
   consistence. This paper shows that VFM is feasible for flash flood risk
   evaluation. Finally, the priorities for flash flood mitigation of 119
   small watersheds in Licheng county are mapped out, which will provide
   effective help for flood disaster mitigation of small basin.}},

Abstract = {{High-quality and high-resolution meteorological information is essential
   to reduce damages due to disastrous weather phenomena such as flash
   flood, strong wind, and heat/cold waves. There are many meteorological
   observation stations operated by Korea Meteorological Administration
   (KMA) in Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). Nonetheless, they are still not
   enough to represent small-scale weather phenomena like convective storm
   cells due to its poor resolution, especially over urban areas with
   high-rise buildings and complex land use. In this study, feasibilities
   to use additional pre-existing networks (e.g., operated by local
   government and private company) are tested by investigating the effects
   of network density on the gridded horizontal distribution of two
   meteorological variables (temperature and precipitation). Two heat wave
   event days and two precipitation events are chosen, respectively. And
   the automatic weather station (AWS) networks operated by KMA,
   local-government, and SKTechX in Incheon area are used. It is found that
   as network density increases, correlation coefficients between the
   interpolated values with a horizontal resolution of 350 m and observed
   data also become large. The range of correlation coefficients with
   respect to the network density shows large in nighttime rather than in
   daytime for temperature. While, the range does not depend on the time of
   day, but on the precipitation type and horizontal distribution of
   convection cells. This study suggests that temperature and precipitation
   sensors should be added at points with large horizontal inhomogeneity of
   land use or topography to represent the horizontal features with a
   resolution higher than 350 m.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is aimed to generate flood inundation maps for the
   flood-prone stretch of Tirthan River, Himachal Pradesh, India by
   establishing hydrodynamic models (HD). An attempt has been made to
   investigate the capability of 1D and 1D-2D coupled HD models for flood
   inundation prediction of extreme flood events.1D model solving fully
   dynamic Saint Venant equation was used for 1D approach and modeling
   package which dynamically couples 1D and 2D model was used for 1D-2D
   coupled approach. Flood frequency analysis was carried out using
   historical records for estimation of extreme flood event discharge
   magnitudes. Stable (calibrated and validated) models were simulated for
   flood inundation prediction with extreme even discharge value as a
   boundary condition. It was concluded that 1D approach gives efficient
   results in the mountainous terrain of Tirthan River while river
   channel-floodplain characteristics restrict the application of 1D-2D
   coupled model.}},
