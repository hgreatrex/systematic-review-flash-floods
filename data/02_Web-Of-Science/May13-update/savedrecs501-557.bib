Abstract = {{This paper present the evaluation of the density of the river network
   with the aim to predict the risk of flash floods in the upper Topla
   river basin. It also present the classification of the river network
   because of its significantly impact on the river basin behind the flood.
   A similar solution was also chosen by the State of Egypt in the larger
   Nuweiba area in 2008, where they collected field survey data, enhanced
   thematic mappers, found morphological characteristics and soil types,
   soil coverage. These morphological parameters have been used by them and
   will be also used in next our research to evaluate the most sensitive
   sub-basins for flooding and to create territorial sensitivity maps for
   flash floods. River density and stream ordering are the basic evaluated
   parameters considered in selected catchment and all others
   characteristics will be assessed in relation to every single sub-basin
   of the upper part of the Topla river.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated with K-means clustering and Apriori algorithm, the
   multi-level association rule mining is proposed to investigate the
   causal factor patterns of flash floods, which consists of the following
   three steps: first, the association between causal factors and flash
   flood occurrence is being analysed; second, to identify the contribution
   of soil moisture (SM) to flash flood hazards, the association between
   risk indicators and SM, and the linkage between SM and risk magnitude
   are being discussed; finally, with the consideration of total 24-h
   rainfall and SM pattern, the association rules for risk magnitude are
   extracted. The method has been tested in a humid area of southern China,
   results show: (1) flash flood hazards are especially active after the
   prolonged and periodic intense rainfalls, and because of the saturated
   SM, flash floods are easily triggered even by slight rainfall; (2)
   severe flash floods are easily triggered by extreme rainfall, and SM is
   the critical indicator of 5-year floods and 20-year floods; and (3)
   owing to the differences in steady infiltration rate and instability in
   soil type, conservation of water and soil is an indispensable and
   co-ordinate part of flood control. Results are expected to be applicable
   for decision-making in flood control and flood prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood is a precipitation of short duration and strong intensity
   which, generally, takes place in small portions of territory. Italy, due
   to climate, morphology and anthropization, is particularly subject to
   these phenomena. The major consequences of the flash floods occur in
   small basins, characterized by modest times of concentration and low
   storage capacity, especially if located close to urban areas. From this
   point of view, the development of alert systems can mitigate the impact
   of the phenomenon on the population. The paper will analyze the problems
   related to flash flood through two case studies near Reggio Calabria. It
   is a site of interest because it is located at the southern end of
   Calabria region, in the South of Italy, and is particularly prone to
   flash floods and environmental risks due to the morphological and
   climatic characteristics of its territory.}},

   study, we implemented a particle based transport model for fast
   prediction of travel paths of contaminants after a spill during a flash
   flood. The model calculates mixing and dispersion in the pipe system and
   on the surface by using a random-walk approach. It is applied to an
   urban catchment of 5 km(2). Influence of pipe to surface coupling due to
   the additional transport paths is demonstrated. The model is based on

Abstract = {{Emergency hazard and risk mapping services are crucial in providing
   rapid-response information for disaster management and reducing damage
   of water-driven cascading disasters such as floods. For rapid-response
   flood mapping, this study introduces an improved flood detection
   algorithm to fuse two different C-band and L-band Synthetic Aperture
   Radar (SAR) images acquired over the same area of interest, e.g.,
   mega-floodplain. The main objective of this study is to propose a new
   algorithm for dynamic flood detection using two different SAR images
   acquired at different times and under different conditions. As an image
   fusion technique, we propose an improved floodwater detection algorithm
   using the pixel-based water fractional fusion and wavelet-based image
   fusion. This approach allows investigating the optimization of fusion
   parameters from two different products in the case of a premonsoon flash
   flood.
   This preliminary study was conducted to identify and estimate
   large-scale flood inundation area over a challenging area, where flash
   flood events often occur along the Maghna River in northen Bangladesh.
   The resultant fused map of the maximum flood-detect extent suggested the
   possibility of a rapid and accurate floodwater detection to identify the
   flood location and extent area with the validation data from
   ground-truth survey in the representative experiment sites.}},

Abstract = {{When applying hydrological models at basin scale, it is essential to
   take into account the contribution of groundwater and its behaviour,
   together with the hydrological state before and after storm events. The
   main objectives of the present study were the evaluation and discussion
   of factors contributing to the formation of river discharge, how and to
   what extent these factors affect the risk of flood and, finally, how
   they are related to the type, duration and intensity of rainfall events,
   especially associated with flash floods.
   This was achieved by applying HEC-HMS models to a small watershed in
   central Italy, characterised by high hydrogeological risk. The watershed
   is equipped for total rainfall, river discharge and groundwater level
   measurement. In addition, double ring infiltrometric tests were
   performed during different hydrological periods. The results highlighted
   a direct correlation between flood risk and the hydrological period; the
   insertion of groundwater data in the model allowed for a sensitivity
   analysis of the relationship between the level of risk and the
   hydrogeological settings and properties of the area. Moreover, the
   analysis of some ``extreme{''} events occurring in the summer period
   highlighted river behaviour in very different hydrological states.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is pervasive, bringing about heat and floods. To address
   these hazards, better coping, adaptation and resilience are needed.
   Cities all over the world suffer from heat and flood disasters that
   account for significant losses. This paper examines the incidence of
   heat and flood occurrence in urban areas, and examines how sustainable
   urban drainage systems (SUDS) is used to combat them. The methodology is
   based on historical event analysis, literature review and secondary
   data. Results indicate that heat and flood hazards in cities can be
   effectively reduced by using SUD systems which incorporate vegetated
   surfaces that absorbs and retains rain water, purifies stormwater and
   transfers heat. Results show that SUD system reduces flood peaks and
   heat, thereby reducing the incidence of flash floods and heat islands.
   SUD system is recommended as a viable method of heat and flood control
   in cities as cities using SUDS were found to cope very well with heat
   and floods. Overall, technical measures of flood management such as SUDS
   are found to be effective, affordable, aesthetically pleasing and
   socially acceptable. A holistic strategy combing technical SUDSs and
   non-technical human aspects of coping and resilience is the key towards
   effective management of floods in cities.}},

Abstract = {{To disclose the formation mechanism of flash flood disaster, it is
   necessary to develop a dynamic critical rainfall model that considers
   all influencing factors. Targeting the Peihe River watershed in China's
   Henan Province, this paper designs a runoff convergence calculation plan
   based on the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH), and
   uses the plan to simulate 8 floods in the target watershed. The
   simulated results were close to the measured data. Next, the GIUH was
   adopted to predict the critical rainfalls of 16 floods in the target
   watershed. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was selected
   to create a dynamic critical rainfall prediction model, with the
   preceding rainfall, cumulative rainfall and rainfall intensity as the
   inputs and the critical rainfall of each event as the output. The model
   was employed to predict the critical rainfalls of 6 historical floods.
   The results show that the prewarned critical rainfall reached the pass
   rates of 100\% and 83.3\%, respectively, for the 1 h and 3 h periods.
   Hence, that the GIUH can ensure the calculation accuracy despite the
   lack of data in regions prone to flash flood; the RBFNN-based dynamic
   critical rainfall prediction model can effectively improve the accuracy
   of critical rainfall calculation and the flash flood prewarning.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid urbanization, climate change, and extreme rainfall have resulted
   in a growing number of cases of urban flash floods. It is important to
   predict the occurrence of a flood so that the aftermath of it can be
   minimized. As the name suggests, an urban flash flood occurs in an urban
   area in a very short span of time. To reduce the impact of these events,
   short-term forecasting or nowcasting is used for prediction of the very
   near future incident. In orthodox methods of flood forecasting, current
   weather conditions are examined using conventional methods such as the
   use of radar, satellite imaging and calculations involving complicated
   mathematical equations. However, recent developments in Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) and Machine Learning (ML) has helped us
   to study this hydrological problem from a different perspective. The aim
   of this paper is to design a theoretical model considering the
   parameters causing the urban flash flood and predict the event
   beforehand. To test the soundness model, data syntheses is performed and
   the results are checked using the artificial neural network.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last three decades, there has been a growing recognition of the
   need to ensure that the design and management of the built environment
   is sensitive to minimizing disturbance to natural hydrology and the
   water quality of the receiving environments. The practice of water
   sensitive urban design (WSUD) has emerged along with a number of other
   approaches to mitigate risks such as flash flooding, pollution of fresh
   and marine receiving waters, and water scarcity. The drivers for
   adopting WSUD practices, and the approaches used, depend on the specific
   context. Practices have continued to evolve and be refined, which has in
   large part been due to lessons learnt from pioneering developments that
   trialled innovative WSUD approaches. The cases reviewed in this chapter
   discuss some examples of leading-edge WSUD approaches that have provided
   the practical demonstration of the challenges and benefits to
   implementing WSUD. They can be used not only to refine standards and
   guidelines but also to build confidence in the WSUD approaches. A
   synthesis of findings from the case studies revealed the importance of
   WSUD being integrated across different urban functions, stakeholders,
   and levels of government. It is also shown that the benefits of WSUD
   often extend beyond the primary objective of improved urban stormwater
   management, reflecting the multifunctional nature of many WSUD
   approaches. These co-benefits often help to build public understanding
   and engagement in the benefits of WSUD. The cases also identified the
   importance of using economic instruments that reflect the true cost of
   different stormwater management approaches, which in turn can create the
   financial incentives for the adoption of WSUD approaches.}},

   Sentinel-2 Satellite Images and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process: A Case
   Study of Ras Ghareb City, Egypt}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Natural hazards are indeed counted as the most critical challenges
   facing our world, represented in floods, earthquakes, volcanoes,
   hurricanes, and forest fires. Among these natural hazards, the flash
   flood is regarded the most frequent. In this work, we utilized two
   Sentinel-2 satellite images, before and after the flash flood, SRTM and
   photos captured by using a helicopter. This paper aims at three prime
   objectives. Firstly, the flood influence is determined on the city of
   Ras Ghareb, Egypt, based on analyzing free satellite data (Sentinel-2
   images). Secondly, fuzzy the analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) method
   and a geographical information system (GIS) are integrated for flood
   risk analysis and evaluation in the flood-prone area. Finally, such a
   flood vulnerability map is used as an index to assist the
   decision-makers prepare for probable flooding. FAHP is preferable as it
   can cater to the uncertainties in data and analysis. As a result, FAHP
   is appropriate to determine the flood-vulnerable area in cities
   especially due to the matching with the most destroyed areas identified
   by the change detection between the two Sentinel-2 images. Then, the
   decision-maker can depend on Sentinel-2 images to estimate the flood
   influence through a regional scale or applying the FAHP on cities
   susceptible to flash floods in case of unavailable satellite images to
   contribute in establishing an early warning system enough to the
   evacuation of the risky areas.}},

Journal = {{REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CONTAMINACION AMBIENTAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{133-147}},
Abstract = {{As one of the most hazardous natural events, flash flood is frequently
   responsible for loss of life and severe damage to infrastructure and
   public health. The Rainfall Threshold (RT) is the main warning index of
   flash flood that is used in China. However, the amount of parameters in
   RT calculation is significantly large, and the determination of some
   parameter values is affected by subjective factors substantially. In
   this paper, a Morris-Sobol Two-layer Progressive Model (M-STPM) is
   established to identify sensitive parameters in RT calculation. Firstly,
   the Morris screening method is applied to qualitatively analyse the
   sensitivity of parameters, while the insensitive parameters are
   filtered. Then the Sobol method is employed to quantify the sensitivity.
   The sensitivity of parameters in RT calculation is determined through a
   case study in Duli Village of Anyang County in Henan Province. The
   results indicate that mean of 1-h annual maximum point rainfall is the
   most influential parameter. It is found that the parameters in water
   level-discharge relation calculation have a large influence on the RT,
   which shows that the proposed model can provide a reference for
   determining the value of parameters and can lay a theoretical foundation
   for further error analysis in RT calculation.}},

Abstract = {{Devastating floods in southeast Queensland in 2011 were the combination
   of flash flooding in the Lockyer Valley with riverine flooding in the
   Brisbane metropolitan area. While there is considerable information
   about the immediate impact on those affected, there is less
   understanding of the long-term health effects that follow such events.
   This study explored the perceptions of health effects and support
   received by people affected by the 2011 southeast Queensland flood six
   years after the event. A cross-sectional survey of 327 people was
   conducted in areas affected by the floods. The questionnaire sought
   information about the ongoing social, economic, demographic and
   self-declared physical and mental health effects. The data were analysed
   through comparison of those unaffected with those directly affected by
   the floods. Residents whose households were flooded were more likely to
   score their health negatively than non-affected residents and had higher
   reported rates of trauma, injury and mental illness. Twenty-six per cent
   of this group reported that they still experience some adverse health
   effects from the floods. Managing the longterm health implications of a
   flood-affected population is an important public policy task.
   Dissatisfaction with recovery operations and perceived injustices
   associated with insurance and compensation arrangements may aggravate
   health consequences. Early recognition and intervention may assist with
   reducing secondary effects.}},

Abstract = {{Event detection is essential for decision makers to understand the
   events surrounding their real world. Social media microblogging
   platforms play a significant role in our life. One of these platforms is
   Twitter, which has an extreme high exchange rate and accordingly has
   become a valuable and relevant source for many political and social
   events. Event detection from social media attracted the attention of
   researchers in different natural languages. Extracting and detecting
   events from Arabic tweets is still under investigation. In this paper,
   we have used the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to
   develop two classifiers for filtering and detecting extracted events
   from Arabic tweets. The first classifier filters the collected tweets
   using two passes. The first pass identifies the hashtags while the
   second pass does a shallow analysis on the tweets content. The second
   classifier analyzes the text extracted from the tweets. As a case study,
   we present the tragic events of the Jordan flash floods near the Dead
   Sea. The model successfully filtered all the collected tweets and picked
   the ones describing the incidents within that region. Analyzed data
   revealed important information to learn from this lesson for the future.
   The solution can be generalized and adapted to other problems.}},

Abstract = {{Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments are routinely used today to
   measure crustal deformation signals from tectonic plate motions,
   faulting, and glacial isostatic adjustment. In parallel with the
   expansion of GPS networks around the world, several new and unexpected
   applications of GPS have been developed. For example, GPS instruments
   are now being used routinely to measure ground motions during large
   earthquakes. Access to real-time GPS data streams has led to the
   development of better hazard warnings for tsunamis, flash floods,
   earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Terrestrial water storage changes
   can be derived from GPS vertical coordinate time series. Finally, GPS
   signals that reflect on the surfaces below a GPS antenna can be used to
   measure soil moisture, snow accumulation, vegetation water content, and
   water levels. In the future, combining GPS with the signals from the
   Russian, European, and Chinese navigation constellations will
   significantly enhance these applications.
   GPS data are now routinely used to study the dynamics of earthquake
   rupture.
   GPS instruments are an integral part of warning systems for earthquakes,
   tsunamis, flash floods, and volcanic eruptions.
   Reflected GPS signals provide a new source of soil moisture, snow depth,
   vegetation water content, and tide gauge data.
   GPS networks can sense changes in soil moisture, groundwater, and snow
   depth and thus can contribute to water resource assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Collecting precise real-time information on urban drainage system
   performance is essential to identify, predict, and manage critical
   loading situations, such as urban flash floods and sewer overflows.
   Although emerging low-power wireless communication techniques allow
   efficient data transfers with great above-ground performance, for
   underground or indoor applications in a large coverage range are
   difficult to achieve due to physical and topological limitations,
   particularly in dense urban areas. In this paper, we first discuss the
   range limitations of the LoRaWAN standard based on a systematic
   evaluation of a long-term operation of a sensor network monitoring
   in-sewer process dynamics. Analyses reveal an-on average-five-fold
   higher data packet loss for sub-surface nodes, which steadily grows with
   increasing distance to the gateway. Second, we present a novel LPWAN
   concept based on the LoRa (R) technology that enhances transmission
   reliability, efficiency, and flexibility in range-critical situations
   through meshed multi-hop routing and ensures a precise
   time-synchronization through optional GPS or DCF77 long-wave time
   signaling. Third, we illustrate the usefulness of the newly developed
   concept by evaluating the radio transmission performance for two
   independent full-scale field tests. Test results show that the
   synchronous LoRa mesh network approach clearly outperforms the standard
   LoRaWAN technique with regard to the reliability of packet delivery when
   transmitting from range-critical locations. Hence, the approach is
   expected to generally ease data collection from difficult-to-access
   locations such as underground areas.}},

Abstract = {{Eco-composite in porous concrete is designed with the mix of concrete
   and a cement replacement, which have the element waste material that
   being recycled, for example, rice husk ash (RHA), egg shells, palm oil
   fly ash, wood waste ash, and many more, for the purpose of ecologically
   sustainable development, and also for managing stormwater quantity and
   quality. The various researches related to eco-composite materials have
   been done, mainly as the construction and building materials. Besides,
   the porous concrete itself is mainly being used as paving material for
   the construction of parking lots, sidewalks and secondary roads. Thus,
   the good quality of porous concrete in terms of the concrete strength,
   the workability, the porosity, and so on are required. Meanwhile,
   previous researches related to effective microorganisms (EM) as an
   admixture in concrete have been done. However, the previous researches
   of eco - composite, specifically using RHA and EM did not focus on the
   drainage systems. Therefore, this paper presents a preliminary study of
   the eco-composite using RHA and EM as a cement replacement, as a green
   technology and sustainable development in urban drainage systems. For
   the part of the research, this technology, which is drain covers (slab)
   as part of the drainage system has been implemented in several areas in
   Selangor, specifically in Shah Alam in order to mitigate the flash
   flood, stagnant water lead to the mosquitos fertilization issue, and
   vandalism of the drainage cover, which cause a safety issue for public.
   The early findings seem encouraging that indicates the eco-composite
   porous concrete can be successfully in construction.}},

Abstract = {{Flash flood occurred on March 20, 2018, in Jatihandap, Bandung City,
   West Java due to the overflow of Cipamokolan River. This has caused
   considerable losses, especially for people living in the area. The flood
   occurred due to high rainfall intensity and inadequate land covering,
   especially in the upstream area (North Bandung Region) where the area is
   filled with housing, villas, and open land. Consequently, the water
   catchment area decreases. The objective of this study is to identify
   flood discharge that occurs due to high rainfall intensity and land
   covering. Flood discharge is calculated using a rational method. Based
   on BMKG data, rain intensity on March 20, 2018, is 45 mm/hour. The
   results of this study show that with this intensity, the Cipamokolan
   River flow brings water with sediment and debris waste. The discharge of
   the river is 207 m3/s. It equals to 2.2 times river basin discharge and
   causing water to overflow into the land around the river. The debris
   flow also damage the levees in Jatihandap then it caused flash floods.}},

Abstract = {{Flashing is a new problem in heavy oil production technology with steam
   flooding. It can cause pump air locks, pump and pump tubing damage,
   reduced production, and other problems. A di(f)ficulty in predicting
   flashing parameters involves accurate calculation of the bottomhole
   temperature and pressure. Based on the principles of heat transfer and
   fluid dynamics, we have proposed the following models: a model for the
   wellbore temperature distribution, a model for the stress distribution,
   a model for calculating the partial loss of pressure when the fluid
   flows through a fixed valve, and also a model for calculating the
   parameters for steam flooding of heavy oil, taking into account
   corrections for the influence of the parameters of the oil water mixture
   on the steam critical temperature vs. pressure curve. Taking into
   account the nature of the fluid, the moisture content, the temperature
   and other wellbore parameters, the model permits real-time monitoring of
   flashing in the pump. Experiments were conducted on Jin 45-22-K281
   wells. We performed a comparative analysis of the calculated and
   experimentally measured values. We have shown that the model for
   calculating flashing parameters is sufficiently accurate for the
   bottomhole fluid conditions. Analysis of the factors influencing the
   flashing effect may be useful for providing a theoretical basis for
   steam flooding parameters.}},

Series = {{Advances in Natural and Technological Hazards Research}},
Year = {{2019}},

Pages = {{145-172}},
Abstract = {{Landslide or the landmass movement is a geomorphic hill slope physical
   process of mass-wasting resulting in downslope rolling of large mass of
   debris, regolith and soil under influence of gravity. It is caused by a
   combination of particular geo-factors that are region or territory
   specific. Landslides are generally triggered and activated by
   substantial precipitation and/or earthquake tremors and other
   anthropogenic interventions such as over the top cutting of slant for
   development of mountainous roads/streets and other excavations for civil
   structures, etc. The relatively young entire Himalayan hilly tract,
   mountainous steep slopes in sub-Himalayan landscape of North-east India,
   Western Ghats, the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu and Konkan ranges are
   susceptible to landslides or debris flow.
   In order to formulate strategies to minimize societal impacts of
   landslides, a systematic approach would entail preparation of Landslide
   Susceptibility Maps linked to landslide incidence inventory and making
   them available to the concerned stakeholders for necessary preparatory
   and mitigation measures. Geological Survey of India (GSI) being the
   nodal agency for landslides studies in India formally launched on
   February 05, 2014 the National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM)
   programme which has been a geoscientific exercise on 1: 50,000 scale on
   GIS platform in making both quantitative or qualitative estimates of
   spatial distribution of landslides which either exists or has the
   potential to occur in a given area. GSI has formulated a set of standard
   operating procedures that emphasize on geo-parametric data collection
   (as per standard and devised formats) for landslide inventory. These
   data sets are synthesized with relevant spatially-distributed causative
   thematic maps into susceptibility zonation which represents geospatial
   information indicating intensity and propensity of landslides. Such
   baseline data will ultimately lead to the collation and evaluation of
   landslide hazard and risk and mitigation plans. It will also help in
   disaster preparedness of the country and to indicate areas critical for
   landslide monitoring and developing early warning system (EWS).
   It is aimed to demarcate and facilitate prioritization of areas for
   further detailed studies (Meso- and Micro-scales) and help in Regional
   Land Use Planning and provide the scientific basis for framing the Land
   Use Zoning Regulations. Several lessons were learnt from Uttarakhand
   disaster of June 2013 in India that compelled re-evaluation of the
   existing methodology of conducting geosurveys of macro scale landslide
   susceptibility maps. Additional geofactors that also need to be
   considered include: effect of toe erosion by higher order streams;
   effect of long runouts of the debris flows and drainage morphometry;
   nature and size of clastic components, etc. It is intended to elaborate
   here a synthesis of various approaches and constraints on continuing
   research on such country-wide programmes on landslides related
   geohazards characterization and its implications on evolving EWS for the
   societal preparedness and resilience for mitigating impending disasters.
   However, any method of predicting landslide susceptibility needs
   validation which sometimes may be difficult in areas having no land
   sliding history. Besides, EWS need also to highlight mitigation
   efforts/remedial measures through geotechnical and engineering solutions
   as suited to Indian conditions on case to case basis, delineation of
   safe escape routes in the event of a landslide/debris flow/flash floods,
   and for optimum utilization of available resources.}},

Abstract = {{Calibration process is usually time demanding and as much streamflow
   information as possible in rainfall-runoff models. Nevertheless, from a

   proposes a set of joint calibration of hydrological model parameters

   catchment in a crowded urban area. As an alternative of free
   calibration, the simulations were carried out based on a list of
   proficient parameters. Four streamflow gauging stations were analysed
   and used to subdivide the basin. The hourly lumped rainfall-runoff model
   GR4H was applied to four critical flash flood events to create a rank of
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criteria (NSE) applying the best set of

   were compensated by hydraulics errors and they presented an equifinality

Title = {{Understanding the Effects of Changing Weather: A Case of Flash Flood in
   Morogoro on January 11, 2018}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{Floods are the leading cause of hydrometeorological disasters in East
   Africa. Regardless of where, when, and how the event has happened,
   floods affect social security as well as environmental damages.
   Understanding floods dynamics, their impacts, and management is thus
   critical, especially in climate risk assessment. In the present study, a
   flash flood (a case of an episodic hydrological event) which happened on
   January 11, 2018, in Morogoro, Tanzania, is examined and synthesized.
   Data were courtesy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration Global Forecasting System (NOAA GFS) (forecast data),
   Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), and Sokoine University of
   Agriculture (for the automatic weather data). With the help of
   ZyGRIB-grib file visualization software (version 8.01, under General
   Public License (GNU GPL v3)), the forecast data and patterns of the
   observation from the automatic weather station (temperatures, wind speed
   and directions, rainfall, humidity, and pressure) and the long-term
   rainfall data analysis in the study area made it possible. This study
   contributes to the knowledge of understanding the changing weather for
   planning and management purposes. Both forecasts and the observations
   captured the flash flood event. The rain was in the category of heavy
   rainfall (more than 50mm per day) as per the regional guidelines. The
   synergy between the forecasts and the 30-minute weather observation
   interval captured the fundamental weather patterns that describe the
   event. For studying the nature and impacts of flash floods in the
   region, the integration of automatic weather observation into the
   systems of national meteorological centers is inevitable. Additionally,
   as part of an integrated disaster risk reduction effort, there is a need
   for a review on catchment management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of natural disasters has become a major global problem.
   It poses serious threats to the concept of sustainable development. Over
   the last two decades, more than 1.3 million people and nearly two
   trillion dollars have been lost due to natural disasters. The paper
   discusses the status of disaster mitigation information systems during
   the Uttarakhand disaster of June 2013. The researchers have discussed
   the status of such actions taken by both Government and Non-Government
   Organizations (NGOs) from a qualitative perspective. The Software
   Package for Social Science (SPSS) software was used for the analysis and
   the results are presented in descriptive statistical format. As many as
   (n = 1500) respondents were interviewed, out of which 80\% respondents
   were ill-informed. Over 80\% respondents were found to be untrained to
   respond in a disastrous situation. Hence, the researchers have proposed
   the use of better information and communication mediums with the
   assistance of public and private partnership (PPP model) to deal with
   disastrous situations in the future along with some indigenous methods.}},

   probability and the associated inundation depth. The risk matrix
   criterion is classified according to the degree of risks as high,

   flood frequencies of 5 years return periods and moderate to high risk
   may exist for flood with rerun period of 50 and 100 years. The results
   are projected on a two-dimensional satellite images that shows the

Journal = {{WASSERWIRTSCHAFT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{39-45}},
Abstract = {{The recent severe weather events in May and June 2018 have once again
   made us realize that heavy rainfall induced flash floods can occur
   everywhere, anytime and often be very local in various forms and
   consequences - a heavy rain risk exists basically in every German
   municipality! However, efficient and standardized hazard and risk maps
   are missing throughout Germany. A uniform and systematic procedure for
   documentation and risk analysis for heavy rainfall events does not
   currently exist. Actual warnings are only based on the precipitation or
   rather on the intensity of the rainfall, whereby the real threat due to
   flash floods is just as insufficiently considered as the vulnerability
   of the urban structures. This article presents an approach for a
   multifunctional heavy rainfall risk information tool which can be used
   for systematic documentation, the generation of standardized, high
   spatially resolved hazard and risk maps as well as for a hydrodynamic,
   risk based early warning system. The operation principle, the
   possibilities and limits of the holistic information tool are explained
   by means of an application example of the city of Aachen as wells as the
   heavy rainfall event of 29.05.2018.}},

   Warning}},
Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1727-1733}},
Abstract = {{The flash flood early warning method based on dynamic critical
   precipitation is proposed, which takes into account the percentage
   saturation of soil moisture content in double-excess model. A series of
   historical precipitation data of various gauge stations in the upper
   catchment of the study area at the early warning cross-section are set
   as the input parameters, thereby the runoff generation and concentration
   in the catchment are obtained in the double-excess model, and the
   percent saturation of soil moisture content is calculated. Based on the
   warning discharge in combination with the percentage saturation of soil
   moisture content, the discriminant relations of the critical
   precipitation for the time intervals, including 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h,
   2.5 h, and 3 h, are computed respectively using the inversion method.
   Using the precipitation data from ground rain gauge stations for year x
   and flood hydrograph data of x typical flood events for the Dayuhe River
   catchment, the SCE-UA algorithm is adopted to calibrate the parameters
   of the double-excess model, and the discriminant functions of dynamic
   critical precipitation for flash flood early warning with 6 time scales
   are validated using x representative historical flood hydrographs. The
   qualification ratio for flash flood early warning exceeds x, which
   demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method.}},

   because of urbanization and climate change, which contribute to an
   increase in runoff. This study applied -Support Vector Machine
   (epsilon-SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for the simulation and
   forecasting streamflow of three different catchments. The Evolutionary
   Strategy (ES) optimization method was used to optimize the ANN and SVM
   sensitive parameters. The relative performance of the two models was
   compared, and the results indicate that both models performed well for
   humid and semi-humid systems, and SVM generally perform better than ANN
   in the streamflow simulation of all catchments.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Flash flood is a significant threat to those who live in China and
   beyond. Reproducing them with distributed hydrological models is an
   effective measure for preventing flash floods. This paper introduces the
   China flash flood hydrological model (CNFF-HM); explores its principles,
   key steps, and applicability; and validates its simulation effects in
   two typical, small ungauged catchments (UCs), namely, Tiezhuling and
   Qianyangxi. First, the applicability of the model and the portability of
   the parameters were verified in Qianyangxi. Then, in Tiezhuling, the
   model parameters were comprehensively determined based on the measured
   values and simulation results, and the influence of the reservoir on the
   simulation effect was analyzed. Using the model's different parameters
   in different catchments, the characteristics of the basin were compared
   and analyzed from the aspects of evapotranspiration, runoff, water
   distribution, and confluence. Finally, the early warning effect was
   evaluated. The results indicated the following: (1) The reservoir has a
   significant impact on model simulation. (2) The two UCs have
   similarities in evapotranspiration, runoff, and water source, and the
   difference in convergence is obvious. (3) With better early warning
   effect, the warning can achieve full coverage. These positive results
   suggest that this method should be further developed and tested.}},

Title = {{Spatial Heterogeneity of Temporal Shifts in Extreme Precipitation across
   India}},

Abstract = {{When analyzing trends and patterns of extreme precipitation, one can
   easily generalize the shifts caused by external climate forcings and map
   a single temporal shift of annual precipitation. However, the complexity
   of a changing environment evidences spatially distributed shifts
   particularly those of extreme precipitation which are essential in
   planning and designing enterprises and, ultimately, in managing
   infrastructure across scales. The goal of this study is to characterize
   the spatial heterogeneity of shifts in the increasing pace of extreme
   events over India. The study has a two-part hypothesis: (1) the number
   of grid cells with significant trends in annual precipitation (P),
   extreme precipitation (R95) and very extreme precipitation (R99) will
   reflect the extent of geophysically vulnerable areas subject to
   increasing or decreasing annual precipitation and (2) the dispersion of
   cells with significant shifting points (which has occurred at different
   historical periods) will evidence the heterogeneity of the changes in P,
   R95 and R99 regimes.
   To test this hypothesis, we used the Mann-Kendall and Pettitt's tests to
   estimate the significance of the increasing and decreasing trends and
   shifting points, respectively, in P, R95 and R99 from 1901-2015 for
   mainland India. Based on a gridded dataset of 0.25 degrees resolution,
   results showed significant temporal trends for spatially averaged R95
   and R99, whereas non-significant inclining temporal trend was found for
   P. Trend analyses applied to the precipitation gridded product of the
   Indian Meteorological Department revealed statistically significant
   trends for almost 38\%, 36\% and 31\% of India's territory for P. R95
   and R99, respectively. Further, the magnitude of these trends proved
   higher for R95 (i.e., 0.42 mm year(-1)) compared with R99 (i.e., 0.31 mm
   year(-1)), supporting the idea of an increasing liability for flash
   floods. Results also showed that most of the temporal shifts in the time
   series of P, R95 and R99 occurred between 1941-1980, at 34\%, 31\% and
   22\% of the grids, respectively. In addition, the opposite trends before
   and after the inflection point were found for locations showing
   significant temporal shifts in R95 and R99.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid ubanization and rise of greenhouse gaseous emission due to
   anthropogenic influences have increased the pressure on global climate
   to maintain its equilibrium. Anthropogenic influences have further
   increased the extreme events, i.e., heat wave, flash flood and cold wave
   event. Our results indicate that years 2012. 2015 and 2016 encountered
   with heat wave event while the year 2013 recorded the highest
   precipitation which is coinciding with the well known flash flood event
   in northern India (Uttarakhand) where intense precipitation with cloud
   burst occurred. Correlation and wavelet coherence analysis was performed
   among temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS),
   precipitation (ppt), potential evapotranspiration (PET) and actual
   evapotranspiration (AET). PET shows strong association with T during the
   heatwave event while AET exhibits the strong association during the
   flash flood event. T and RH show the time lag at averaged monthly scale
   where T attains its peak during the summer time while RH attains its
   peak during the monsoon time. The highest coefficient of variation (COV)
   shown by ppt is due to its dependency on Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM)
   during the monsoon time. We have further analysed the monthly
   amplitudinal variation of all parameters in order to observe the
   seasonality. Furthermore, wavelet coherence analysis was also performed
   to see the dependency among all parameters at high temporal scale.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the analysis of the extreme precipitation event in
   Central Nepal on 19 July 2007 which was part of a sequence of rain
   events leading to the devastating South Asia flood of 2007. We
   investigate synoptic-scale conditions using reanalyses and attribute
   moisture sources with a Lagrangian moisture source diagnostic. Further,
   we characterize the mesoscale precipitation event with a high-resolution
   numerical simulation. The simulation reveals an intense wide convective
   event with a simulated 40 dBZ echo core of considerable horizontal
   extent (1,550 km(2)) exceeding a height of 12 km. Initially small
   convective cells were invigorated by high CAPE and a potentially
   unstable layer at mid-tropospheric levels. This layer reached
   conditional instability adding latent energy to the system. Isolated
   convective cells organized upscale into a wide intense convective
   system, fuelled with moist low-level inflow. The result was torrential
   rain with over 250 mm within 24 hr. Several synoptic-scale conditions
   contributed to the intense development: (a) supply of moist air with the
   help of a typical monsoon break condition flow pattern, (b) anomalously
   significant moisture sources along this path due to prior precipitation
   events, (c) an upper-tropospheric trough orienting the atmospheric flow
   against the Himalayas with associated quasi-geostrophic forcing creating
   a favourable environment for convection, and (d) destabilized
   stratification due to an upslope flow. This analysis encompasses
   multiple scales and shows how a wide intense convective system, not
   unusual for this region, can be intensified by distinct synoptic
   constituents.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed descriptions of the architecture of dryland-river deposits are
   few, which hinders the understanding of stratigraphic development in
   aggradational settings. The aim of this study was to obtain new insight
   into the depositional dynamics and resultant stratigraphy of steep,
   high-energy dryland rivers in particular. The study site is within the
   Luni River, the largest river in the Thar Desert, India. A 700m wide
   section, 5m deep, was logged and the dated-stratification related to the
   flow regimen. Seasonal discharges may reach 14000m(3)sec(-1) but the bed
   is usually dry. The deposits consist mainly of sandy upper-stage plane
   bed lamination and low-angle stratification deposited in supercritical
   flows with some strata showing gravel-lense antidune signatures.
   Estimated hydraulic parameters indicate a dominance of the upper-stage
   plane bed state. Less frequent dune trough cross-sets occur at all
   depths, yet commonly as isolated sets with erosive upper boundaries.
   Localized deep scour causes slumping and soft-sediment deformation.
   Scour holes adjacent to older bedded deposits are rapidly infilled,
   often by massive deposits. Repeated deep scour results in units of
   deposition of different ages (50 to 500abp) and different facies found
   at similar shallow depths (2 to 3m). Older dates (1 to 2kabp) occur in
   lower strata (4 to 5m depths) at which depths younger units also are
   preserved locally. The steep, high-energy depositional environment
   promotes the unusual preservation and predominance of upper-stage
   facies, in contrast to a relative paucity of lower-stage facies.
   Frequent local deep-scour during floods means that specific facies
   rarely can be traced across the river channel for more than a few
   metres, but are replaced by other facies in close proximity. These
   results should help interpretation of high-energy sediment deposits
   widely and improve understanding of the stratigraphic development in
   modern dryland rivers, and in characterizing oil, gas and groundwater
   reservoirs in the dryland geological record more generally.}},

   Analysis in Complex Terrain over Eastern China}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Polarimetric radar measurements and products perform as the cornerstones
   of modern severe weather warning and nowcast systems. Two radar
   quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) frameworks, one based on a
   radar-gauge feedback mechanism and the other based on standard rain drop
   size distribution (DSD)-derived rainfall retrieval relationships, are
   both evaluated and investigated through an extreme severe convective
   rainfall event that occurred on 23 June 2015 in the mountainous region
   over eastern China, using the first routinely operational C-band
   polarimetric radar in China. Complex rainstorm characteristics, as
   indicated by polarimetric radar observables, are also presented to
   account for the severe rainfall field center located in the gap between
   gauge stations. Our results show that (i) the improvements of the
   gauge-feedback-derived radar QPE estimator can be attributed to the
   attenuation correction technique and dynamically adjusted Z-R
   relationships, but it greatly relies on the gauge measurement accuracy.
   (ii) A DSD-derived radar QPE estimator based on the specific
   differential phase (K-DP) performs best among all rainfall estimators,
   and the interaction between the mesocyclone and the windward slope of
   the mountainous terrain can account for its apparent overestimation.
   (iii) The rainstorm is mainly dominated by small-sized and
   moderate-sized raindrops, with the mean volume diameter being less than
   2 mm, but its K-DP column (K-DP > 3 degrees km(-1)) has a liquid water
   content that is higher than 2.4815 gm(-3), and a high raindrop
   concentration (N-w) with log(10)(N-w) exceeding 5.1 mm(-1)m(-3). In
   addition, small hailstones falling and melting are also found in this
   event, which further aggregates N-w upon the severe rainfall center in
   the gap between gauge stations.}},

Abstract = {{World Heritage sites in general are exposed to the impacts of natural
   hazards, which threaten their integrity and may compromise their value.
   Floods are a severe threat to the Angkor World Heritage site. Studies of
   regional floods and flood hazard zoning have played an increasingly
   important role in ensuring sustainability of the Angkor site. This study
   developed a flood hazard index (FHI) model based on a geographic
   information system (GIS) and used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to
   extract historical floods at Angkor from 2007 to 2013. Four indices
   (flood affected frequency, absolute elevation, elevation standard
   deviation, drainage density) were used to identify flood-prone areas.
   The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Delphi method were employed
   to determine the weight of each index. The weighted indices were then
   used to develop a distribution map of flood hazards at Angkor. The
   results show that 9 monuments are at risk by potential floods among the
   52 components of the Angkor monuments. The high hazard and
   moderate-to-high hazard areas in the core zone are mainly located
   surrounding the West Baray but will not bring direct risk impact on the
   monuments located in the core archaeological zone. The moderate hazard
   areas are located on both sides of the Siem Reap and Roluos rivers and
   in the flooded area of the Tonle Sap Lake in the core archaeological
   zone. These areas cover 19.4 km(2), accounting for 9.13\% of the total
   area of the core zone. This moderate hazard zone poses a greater flood
   threat to the core zone and must be given higher attention. The buffer
   zone is a small area with fewer sites. As such, flooding has a low
   impact on the buffer zone. The methods used in this study can be applied
   to flood hazard assessments of other heritage sites in Southeast Asia.}},

   (WRF-Hydro). The flash flood was caused by a severe storm during the
   morning of 15 November 2017 around Mandra area resulting in extensive
   damages and 24 fatalities. The X-band dual-polarization (XPOL) weather
   radar of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) observed precipitation
   rates reaching 140 mm/h in the core of the storm. CHAOS simulation
   unveils the persistent orographic convergence of humid southeasterly
   airflow over Pateras mountain as the dominant parameter for the
   evolution of the storm. WRF-Hydro simulated the flood using three
   different precipitation estimations as forcing data, obtained from the
   CHAOS simulation (CHAOS-hydro), the XPOL weather radar (XPOL-hydro) and
   the Global Precipitation Measurement (GMP)/Integrated Multi-satellitE
   Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) satellite dataset (GPM/IMERG-hydro). The
   findings indicate that GPM/IMERG-hydro underestimated the flood
   magnitude. On the other hand, XPOL-hydro simulation resulted to
   discharge about 115 m(3)/s and water level exceeding 3 m in Soures and
   Agia Aikaterini streams, which finally inundated. CHAOS-hydro estimated
   approximately the half water level and even lower discharge compared to
   XPOL-hydro simulation. Comparing site-detailed post-surveys of flood
   extent, XPOL-hydro is characterized by overestimation while CHAOS-hydro
   and GPM/IMERG-hydro present underestimation. However, CHAOS-hydro shows
   enough skill to simulate the flooded areas despite the forecast
   inaccuracies of numerical weather prediction. Overall, the simulation
   results demonstrate the potential benefit of using high-resolution
   observations from a X-band dual-polarization radar as an additional
   forcing component in model precipitation simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Of the boundary conditions that affect the simulation of convective
   precipitation, soil moisture is one of the most important. In this
   study, we explore the impact of the soil moisture on convective
   precipitation, and factors affecting it, through an extensive numerical
   experiment based on four convective precipitation events that caused
   moderate to severe flooding in the Gard region of southern France.
   High-spatial-resolution (1 km) weather simulations were performed using
   the integrated atmospheric model Regional Atmospheric Modeling
   System/Integrated Community Limited Area Modeling System (RAMS/ICLAMS).
   The experimental framework included comparative analysis of five
   simulation scenarios for each event, in which we varied the magnitude
   and spatial distribution of the initial volumetric water content using
   realistic soil moisture fields with different spatial resolution. We
   used precipitation and surface soil moisture from radar and satellite
   sensors as references for the comparison of the sensitivity tests. Our
   results elucidate the complexity of the relationship between soil
   moisture and convective precipitation, showing that the control of soil
   water content on partitioning land surface heat fluxes has significant
   impacts on convective precipitation. Additionally, it is shown how
   different soil moisture conditions affect the modeled microphysical
   structure of the clouds, which translates into further changes in the
   magnitude and distribution of precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{The field research in this book is about human and natural replies to
   main climate change-associated effects as storms, floods, and landslides
   in two areas: the Ky Anh coastal district in the North Central Vietnam
   and the Van Chan mountainous district in the Northern Vietnam. While in
   the open literature ample attention is given to these climate
   change-associated effects in deltas and in the lowlands near the sea,
   less information is available about how people in the mountains
   experience and adapt to the changing mountainous climate.
   Climate variation exists in a long country as Vietnam bordered by an
   over 3000-km-long coast. Therefore this chapter overviews the changing
   climate in the wider geographical context of both study areas: the 6
   coastal provinces of North Central Vietnam and the 15 provinces of the
   Northern mountainous region. The first part of this regional approach
   describes core climate aspects as temperature and wet precipitation
   along the coast of Central Vietnam. This is followed by the
   phenomenology of storms, flash floods, droughts, and landslides. This
   section is concluded with an analysis of the vulnerability of the six
   main sectors in this area: agri-and aquaculture, forestry, industry,
   tourism, and the dense population living here. The second part of this
   chapter aims at a similar approach adapted to the mountains in the
   northern part of the country. Temperature changes and drought are
   analyzed, next to floods, flash floods, landslides, and periods of
   drought and (low) temperature extremes.}},

Volume = {{177}},

Abstract = {{A correct estimation of the instantaneous peak flow (IPF) is crucial to
   reducing the consequences of flash floods. An approach to estimate the
   IPF, obtained by combining Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)
   simulation and machine-learning models, was proposed and then verified
   by comparison with observation-based results in the Ladra river basin,
   northwest Spain. The SWAT model has been used to estimate the maximum
   mean daily flow (MMDF), and machine-learning models have been used to
   estimate the IPF based on MMDF. Four nonlinear time-series intelligence
   models, artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference
   system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning
   machine (ELM) were applied, and their results were compared. The
   Modified Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (MNSE) and the index of
   agreement (d) were used to evaluate SWAT performance while simulating
   MMDF, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean
   square error (RMSE) were employed to evaluate the performance of these
   intelligent systems. According to the results, the SWAT hydrological
   model is a useful tool to simulate MMDF. Validation analyses resulted in
   values of statistical indexes (MNSE = 0.64 and d = 0.95). Regarding
   intelligent systems, the results show that they can be successfully used
   in predicting IPF, but ELM has demonstrated a superior ability to
   estimate IPF from the MMDF (R-2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 48.59). The results of
   this study can contribute to predicting IPF in areas where sub-daily
   observational data are scarce, thereby reducing uncertainties associated
   with IPF estimations. (C)2018 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

   season and hydrologic variability}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Foodweb analyses can provide insight as to how species persist in
   naturally dynamic environments and how these communities may respond to
   anthropogenic alteration. In the remaining undammed rivers of the arid
   southwestern United States, it is thought that plasticity in feeding
   behavior allows native fishes to thrive in the context of natural
   fluctuations in temperature, sediment, and resource availability
   associated with extreme swings in season and hydrology. There have been
   few evaluations of this hypothesis, in part owing to the rarity of
   rivers that retain their natural environmental dynamics and complement
   of native species. We investigated the feeding ecology of the fish
   assemblage of one such river, the Little Colorado River, Arizona,
   focusing on four native species: bluehead sucker (Catostomus
   discobolus), flannel-mouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis), speckled dace
   (Rhinichthys osculus), and endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha). Over
   two years, we sampled fish diets in July, September, January, March, and
   June, encompassing turbid and clear-water conditions across seasons. We
   quantified food resource contributions to fish diets in fish-centered
   food webs, comparing diversity of trophic linkages and linkage-strength
   distribution across time. We used ordination analyses to investigate
   differences in diets among species and changes in diet composition
   across seasons and conducted seasonal comparisons of gut fullness. We
   observed a high diversity of dietary items (as absolute numbers and
   consumer-resource ratios) within a fish assemblage that was apparently
   resistant to extreme and recurrent environmental variability. Fish diet
   diversity was similar to 2x that of the nearby dammed Colorado River's
   tailwater, and over 50\% of fish-resource linkages were weak (<1\% of
   species' diet). Native fishes consumed a mix of terrestrial and aquatic
   resources. Notably, the water column-feeding humpback chub consumed the
   largest percentage of terrestrially derived food items and appeared to
   capitalize on food resources made available by a summer flash flood,
   consuming twice as much during this flood than during other seasons
   (based on gut fullness, corrected by estimates of food quality). Other
   fishes exhibited similar dietary variation. Such opportunist/generalist
   strategies, coupled with diverse food resources, may be important to the
   persistence of these and other native fishes in dynamic environments.}},

Abstract = {{This study delineated flash flood hazard zones leading to vast
   destruction to infrastructure, property, and loss of life. An integrated
   approach using remote sensing and geographic information systems was
   applied to reveal flash flood-prone zones. The study approach evaluated
   topographic, geologic, and hydrologic factors holistically to assess
   these hazard zones. The morphometric characteristics of Wadi Dahab
   sub-basins were supported by topographic, geologic, and hydrologic
   information. Data from Shuttle Radar Terrain Mission and Operational
   Land Imager imagery were analyzed to characterize hydrological
   morphometrics, lithology, soil types, and land use. A Natural Resources
   Conservation Service model was selected to calculate runoff depth at
   ungauged watersheds. A spatially distributed unit hydrograph was adopted
   to create the flow time and runoff velocity. The Flashflood Hazard Model
   was developed by spatial integration of all contributing factors. An
   analytical hierarchy process was adopted for the logic ranking of the
   effective factors. The flash flood hazard map classifies Wadi Dahab

Abstract = {{Flood risk management is gradually shifting from a risk-based approach
   to an integrated one that, among other elements, considers risk
   communication (RC) as a means of boosting resilience. Regardless of the
   above, few scientists have tackled up to now the integration of RC into
   flood risk management. In this connection, this particular study seeks
   to check out the potential of a risk dialogue approach (based on an ad
   hoc RC strategy) to change attitudes and behaviours in relation to flash
   flood risk. Via a pre-post survey design, we evaluated risk perception
   and awareness regarding a Civil Protection Plan (CPP) implemented
   locally (i.e., in the municipality of Navaluenga, central Spain). For
   this particular objective, a questionnaire survey was created, and 201
   adults (representing more than 10\% of the population census) were
   interviewed twice in a one-year period. Before the second survey, an RC
   strategy was created. The RC strategy comprised briefings, quiz answers,
   storytelling, a contest of videos and photographs about past floods, and
   an intergenerational workshop. A t-test for paired sample analyses and a
   general linear model (GLM) repeated measures ANOVA were applied to
   identify changes in risk perception and awareness. Our results indicate
   that the RC strategy did increase flood risk perception in Navaluenga in
   the long term (lifetime). Also, it increased the level of awareness of
   the various features that comprise the CPP, enabling people to be more
   competent in facing a flash flood. Some cognitive biases detected in the
   perceptual process of human beings may shed some light on the results
   obtained. The implementation of well-thought-out RC strategies can play
   a role in improving resilience, particularly in geographic areas such as
   the Iberian Peninsula, in which climate change scenarios indicate a
   likely increase in the severity and frequency of flooding.}},

Abstract = {{This main objective of this study is flash flood susceptibility modeling
   using geo-morphometric and hydrological approaches in Panjkora Basin,
   Eastern Hindu Kush, Pakistan. In the study region, flash flood is one of
   the horrific and recurrent hydro-meteorological disasters causing
   damages to human life, their properties, and infrastructure. Watershed
   modeling approach is implemented to delineate Panjkora Basin, its
   sub-basins, and extract drainage network by utilizing Advance Space
   borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital
   Elevation Model as an input data in geographic information system
   environment. A total of 30 sub-basins were delineated using threshold of
   25km(2). The geo-morphometric parameters of each sub-basin were computed
   by applying Hortonian, Schumm, and Strahler Geo-morphological laws. The
   value of each parameter was normalized and aggregated into
   geo-morphometric ranking number depicting the degree of flash flood
   susceptibility. Surface run-off depth of each sub-basin is estimated by
   applying Natural Resource Conservation Service Curve Number hydrological
   model. Both models outputs were integrated by implementing weighted
   overlay analysis technique and susceptibility map is obtained. The
   resultant map was analyzed and zonated into very high, high, moderate,
   low, and very low flash flood susceptibility zones. These zones were
   spread over an area of 1441km(2) (27\%), 1950km(2) (36.5\%), 1252km(2)
   (23.4\%), 604km(2) (11.3\%), and 98km(2) (1.8\%), respectively.
   Spatially, the very high susceptible zone is located in the upstream
   areas, characterized by snow covered peaks, steep gradient (>30
   degrees), and high drainage density (>1.7km/km(2)), and geologically
   dominated by igneous and metamorphic lithological units. Analysis
   indicated that flash flood susceptibility is directly increases with
   increasing surface run-off and geo-morphometric ranking number. A new
   model is developed to geo-visualize the spatial pattern of flash flood
   susceptibility. Accuracy of the model is assessed using global
   positioning system-based primary data regarding past-flood damages and
   flood marks. The study results can facilitate Disaster Management
   Authorities and flood dealing line agencies to initiate
   location-specific flood-risk reduction strategies in highly susceptible
   areas of Panjkora Basin. Similarly, this methodological approach can be
   adapted for any highland river system.}},

Abstract = {{We present here the first record of past flooding activity from the
   Carpathian Mountains, Eastern Europe, based on documentary evidence and
   sedimentary records along one of the main rivers draining this region
   (Somesul Mic River). Three periods of increased flood activity have
   occurred in Transylvania during the last millennium: the first at the
   beginning of the 10th century (the end of the Dark Ages Cold Period and
   beginning of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP)); the second at the end of
   the 16th and beginning of 17th century, during the cold Little Ice Age
   (LIA) and the third at the end of the 19th century. During the early
   MWP, generally wet summers resulted in a high incidence of floods and/or
   high discharges, while the cluster of floods at the end of 16th and
   beginning of the 17th centuries occurred mostly at flash floods
   generated during heavy summer thunderstorms. Increasing winter
   temperatures and spring precipitations probably caused the high
   incidence of floods at the end of the 19th century. The predominantly
   wet conditions during the MWP are likely to have resulted from northward
   penetration of Mediterranean cyclones during a (mostly) positive phase
   of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), while wet conditions during the
   LIA arose as a combination of increases in local storminess and moisture
   transport from the North Atlantic along more southerly positioned
   westerlies associated with a negative phase of the NAO.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on conceptual and methodological developments
   allowing the integration of physical and social dynamics leading to
   model forecasts of circumstance-specific human losses during a flash
   flood. To reach this objective, a random forest classifier is applied to
   assess the likelihood of fatality occurrence for a given circumstance as
   a function of representative indicators. Here, vehicle-related
   circumstance is chosen as the literature indicates that most fatalities
   from flash flooding fall in this category. A database of flash flood
   events, with and without human losses from 2001 to 2011 in the United
   States, is supplemented with other variables describing the storm event,
   the spatial distribution of the sensitive characteristics of the exposed
   population, and built environment at the county level. The catastrophic
   flash floods of May 2015 in the states of Texas and Oklahoma are used as
   a case study to map the dynamics of the estimated probabilistic human
   risk on a daily scale. The results indicate the importance of time- and
   space-dependent human vulnerability and risk assessment for short-fuse
   flood events. The need for more systematic human impact data collection
   is also highlighted to advance impact-based predictive models for flash
   flood casualties using machine-learning approaches in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Watershed-scale water quality models are often used for interpreting
   changes in complex environmental systems. Precipitation is a primary
   control affecting the output of watershed-scale water quality model, and
   higher resolution of precipitation data is highly desirable. The
   objective of this study was to investigate whether the radar rainfall
   estimates can improve the accuracy of stream flow, TSS load, and TP load
   simulations with the soil and water assessment tool for high-and
   low-flow conditions. Yeongsan River watershed (YRW) was selected for
   this study. This watershed, located south-west of Korean Peninsula, has
   an area of about 2,938 km(2), and is divided into 25 sub-watersheds. The
   simulations were conducted under different rainfall datasets: (1)
   rainfall observations from nine ground rain gauges (GR), (2) 25
   corrected radar rainfall estimates (RR), and (3) a combination of nine
   ground rain gauges and 16 corrected radar rainfall estimates that
   represent the 16 ungauged sub-watersheds in YRW (GARR). Simulation
   results under different the rainfall datasets were compared using the
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and percentage bias. The
   prediction of both high and low stream flows using GARR was better than
   using GR and RR data. The model performance for predicting TSS load was
   significantly better under GARR data than under GR and RR data. In case
   of TP, the model performances using RR and GARR data were significantly
   better than that using GR data. Overall, combining gauge rainfall and
   corrected radar rainfall led to an improvement in the prediction
   accuracy for the watershed-scale water quality model.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{157}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Drought and flash flooding are two common water stresses that negatively
   affect the rice growth and development in South China. Unfortunately, in
   some cases, rice plants have to experience these two stresses within a
   short time. A study on root plasticity responses and their relationships
   with grain yield (GY) in rice under drought-flood abrupt alternating
   (DFAA) water stresses at jointing-booting stage was conducted in a
   specially designed experimental pool. The two-year outdoor pot
   experiment was composed of six DFAA treatments with combinations of
   different droughts and floods. Three additional treatments, namely, the
   drought-followed-by no-flood (DNF), no-drought-followed-by-flood (NDF),
   and control treatment, were prepared for each of the DFAA treatment.
   Results showed that responses of root and yield related traits in rice
   to DFAA were not the additive effect of drought alone and flooding alone
   and there existed interaction (positive/negative compensation) between
   them. DFAA increased bleeding intensity (BI) significantly at the end of
   flooding, but the increases were less than those of DNF. Compared to DNF
   and NDF, DFAA showed the highest reduction in total root length, root
   and shoot dry weight, root mean diameter, root surface area (RSA), and
   root volume at the end of flooding. However, specific root length and
   RSA/root volume ratio increased. Root/shoot ratio in DFAA and DNF varied
   from 2016 to 2017, while it was enhanced in NDF in both years. During
   recovery period, differences in root traits among treatments still
   existed. The preceding drought weakened the effects of subsequent
   flooding on GY in rice. The yield losses in DNF, DFAA, and NDF (reduced
   by 13.0\%, 24.9\%, and 33.5\% on average, respectively) were mainly
   attributed to a smaller total number of spikelets and thinner filled
   spikelets. The percentage of filled grains (FG) depended on the degrees
   of drought and flooding. Rewatering after drought tended to increase FG,
   while flooding after drought tended to decrease it. Yield-related traits
   in DFAA were significantly associated with most of root traits at the
   end of flooding, while these correlations were not significant in DNF

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},

Abstract = {{The coincidence of two or more extreme events (precipitation and storm
   surge, for example) may lead to severe floods in coastal cities. It is
   important to develop powerful numerical tools for improved flooding
   predictions (especially over a wide range of spatial scales - metres to
   many kilometres) and assessment of joint influence of extreme events.
   Various numerical models have been developed to perform high-resolution
   flood simulations in urban areas. However, the use of high-resolution
   meshes across the whole computational domain may lead to a high
   computational burden. More recently, an adaptive isotropic unstructured
   mesh technique has been first introduced to urban flooding simulations
   and applied to a simple flooding event observed as a result of flow
   exceeding the capacity of the culvert during the period of prolonged or
   heavy rainfall. Over existing adaptive mesh refinement methods (AMR,
   locally nested static mesh methods), this adaptive unstructured mesh
   technique can dynamically modify (both, coarsening and refining the
   mesh) and adapt the mesh to achieve a desired precision, thus better
   capturing transient and complex flow dynamics as the flow evolves.
   In this work, the above adaptive mesh flooding model based on 2D shallow
   water equations (named as Floodity) has been further developed by
   introducing (1) an anisotropic dynamic mesh optimization technique
   (anisotropic-DMO); (2) multiple flooding sources (extreme rainfall and
   sea-level events); and (3) a unique combination of anisotropic-DMO and
   high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM) data. It has been applied to
   a densely urbanized area within Greve, Denmark. Results from MIKE 21 FM
   are utilized to validate our model. To assess uncertainties in model
   predictions, sensitivity of flooding results to extreme sea levels,
   rainfall and mesh resolution has been undertaken. The use of
   anisotropic-DMO enables us to capture high resolution topographic
   features (buildings, rivers and streets) only where and when is needed,
   thus providing improved accurate flooding prediction while reducing the
   computational cost. It also allows us to better capture the evolving
   flow features (wetting-drying fronts).}},

Title = {{Sinkholes as a source of life in the Dead Sea region}},
Journal = {{AQUATIC SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, the Dead Sea region has suffered greatly from
   anthropogenic activities that have resulted in a massive decrease of the
   Dead Sea water level. This decrease has allowed the penetration of fresh
   ground water into the underground layer, which dissolved the salt layer
   and created sinkholes. Presently there are over 5000 sinkholes spread
   across the west bank of the Dead Sea, some of which are filled with
   water originating from rainfall, flash floods and spring water. Although
   sinkholes are detrimental to road infrastructure and tourist sites, they
   have dramatically increased the number of aquatic habitats surrounding
   the Dead Sea. In a cross-sectional study of 94 sinkholes along the
   north-west bank of the Dead Sea, coupled with a longitudinal study of
   six sinkholes, we examined how the community of invertebrates in the
   sinkholes is affected by environmental and geographic variables and how
   biological succession occurs in the sinkholes. We found that sinkholes
   are populated mainly by aquatic insects, which have high tolerance of a
   variety of environmental conditions. We also found that the community of
   invertebrates in the sinkholes is shaped by environmental variables such
   as salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, water temperature and
   the size of the sinkhole. We further found that the geographic distance
   between the sinkholes increases spatial species turnover and that
   species turnover across time was high. Patterns of species composition
   were similar in all the sinkholes, with the community structure during
   the wet season changing from early to mid-season, and then again from
   mid-season to late season. Interestingly, despite the extreme conditions
   of the water of the sinkholes, their seasonal succession processes were
   similar to those of temporary water bodies along the Mediterranean coast
   of Israel.}},

   The package considerably extends the capabilities of R to process
   atmospheric soundings or model results. This will be useful for many
   practical environmental forecasting applications at different scales,

Title = {{Influence of atmospheric rivers in the occurrence of devastating flood
   associated with extreme precipitation events over Chennai using
   different reanalysis data sets}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{215}},
Pages = {{12-36}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The main focus of the present study is to examine the presence of
   Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) in the occurrence of Chennai (13.5 degrees N,
   80.5 degrees E) flood event over Tamil Nadu which is south-eastern part
   of Indian peninsular region of India during November to December 2015.
   The vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport (IVT)
   algorithm was used for the detection of ARs using three different
   reanalysis products, namely, the NCEP-NCAR (National Center for
   Atmospheric Research), NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for
   Research and Applications (MERRA) and ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis
   (ERA-Interim). It is noticed that the occurrence of heavy precipitation
   events (HPEs) prior to the flood in the Chennai city, has been in good
   agreement with the presence of ARs during that time. The distribution
   from TRMM-3B42RT, TRMM-3B42 are validated with the with in situ rain
   gauge observations over the Chennai city. We have conducted quantitative
   analysis of IVT and their impact on heavy precipitation events and flood
   occurred over Chennai city. It is seen that MERRA reanalysis could be
   able to provide better presence of ARs. The study mainly reveals that
   persistent ARs of > 18 h resulted in extremely heavy precipitation and
   lead to associated flood over Chennai. Also, the atmospheric conditions,
   ARs and rainfall simulated from Advanced Research Weather Research and
   Forecasting model (ARW) show good agreement with reanalysis and
   observations. Over the given reference period 1979-2015, correlation
   between IVT and HPEs is statistically significant at 99.5\% confidence
   level. But the correlation between IVT during persistent ARs and
   corresponding HPEs is statistically significant at 90\% confidence
   level. A large fraction of HPEs occur after ARs, with a small portion of
   ARs would lead to HPEs. The Chennai gird historical rainfall data is
   suitably fitted by Extreme Value Distribution (EVD) models. Inference
   model using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was applied on EVD
   considering their impact on the shape parameter and the confidence
   interval width. A Non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV)
   analysis, was used to determine the strength of association between the
   precipitation extremes and IVT. The influence of the location and the
   scale parameter in the GEV model on different return levels (2-year,
   20-year, and 100-year) are explicitly described. The returnlevel
   threshold values are found to change with NT considerably. This study
   advocates that the detection of ARs can be used as important proxy in
   identifying the likelihood of occurrence of heavy precipitation/flash
   flood events for a given location using reanalysis data sets.}},

   Case Study in Wadi Al-Alb, Saudi Arabia}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated economic development in arid areas results in harmful stress
   on limited surface and groundwater resources. Flash flood and rainfall
   harvesting is a promising renewable resource. Using a theoretical water
   budget approach, this paper investigates groundwater recharge after a
   flash flood in three small dam reservoirs and one moderate-capacity dam
   reservoir in the Al-Alb basin, central Saudi Arabia. This approach is
   validated against water level measurements at five recharge wells.
   Watershed modeling of this basin was conducted using an analysis of
   Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)
   digital elevation models, in which the morphometric variables were
   calculated. Landsat-8 and Spot-5 images from April 2015 were classified
   to identify different land-use and land-cover categories. The soil
   conservation service curve number (SCS CN) method was used to estimate
   the effective rainfall, where the estimated CN values of different land
   uses and the spatially distributed time-area zones of the catchment were
   identified. The rainfall-runoff relationship was assessed using the
   Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS)
   model, and the results were validated using the actual reservoir
   storages of these dams. The lag time, time of concentration, time to
   peak, and maximum of discharge storage reservoir sizes and volumes were
   estimated for the main and subbasins of the Al-Alb basin. This research
   shows that considerable amounts of water can be harvested using these
   small dams (0.21x106m3 to 6.95x106m3). The hydrographs show that the
   construction of smaller dams upstream of the main dam at the Al-Alb
   location decreases the main peak magnitude by 14\%, and the main runoff
   volume by 3\%. Because of the high evaporation rate and low natural
   groundwater recharge as a result of siltation process in the dam lakes,
   recharge wells were drilled in the dam reservoir, increasing groundwater
   recharge by 44\% and decreasing evaporation loss by 86\%. With time,
   well recharge efficiency decreases, owing to clogging by the siltation
   process. Consequently, it is recommended to periodically clean and
   maintain the recharge wells. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Reliable and complete knowledge of the historical floods is necessary
   for understanding the extreme hydrological dynamics of the rivers, their
   natural variability and anthropic changes. In this work we reconstruct
   the most important floods of the Ebro basin during the last 400 years in
   different areas of the basin. The analysis is based on four different
   areas: the Ebro River at Zaragoza, the Cinca River at Fraga, the Segre
   River at Lleida, and the Ebro River near its mouth at Tortosa.
   Based on a documentary research, we have first obtained relevant
   information about the initial conditions (rainfall duration and
   distribution, snow cover influence) and the maximum flood heights that
   allow to reconstruct the maximum peak flows by using hydraulic models
   and to calculate the subbasins contributions.
   The results show four main types of extreme floods: a) those affecting
   simultaneously all the subbasins with the highest peak discharges (Ebro
   at Tortosa in 1787: 0.15 m(3) s(-1) km(-2)); b) those originated at the
   western basin, upstream from Zaragoza, with an Atlantic origin,
   presenting moderate maximum peak flows, caused by persistent winter
   rainfall and where snowmelt significantly contributes to the flood; c)
   those originating at the central Pyrenean subbasins, with Mediterranean
   origin, occurring, with high peak discharges. These mainly occur during
   autumn as a consequence of rainfalls of different duration (between 3
   days and 1 month), and without significant snow thawing and d) finally,
   less frequent but very intense flash floods events centered in the Lower
   Ebro area with low peak flows.
   In terms of frequency, two different periods can be distinguished: from
   1600 until 1850, the frequency of events is low; since 1850 the
   frequency of events is clearly higher, due to an increase of the
   climatic variability during last stages of the Little Ice Age. From the
   1960's reservoirs construction modifies discharges regime. (c) 2018

Title = {{Mapping the capacity of concave green land in mitigating urban pluvial
   floods and its beneficiaries}},

Abstract = {{Pluvial floods can exert significant pressure on urban sustainability
   and human wellbeing during rapid urbanization. Rapid urbanization and
   exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role
   in mitigating urban flooding in China. The newly applied ``Sponge
   City{''} plan considers the concave green land (CGL) as an effective
   tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and
   beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this
   research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis,
   and mitigation assessment in central Shanghai, China. It reveals that
   CGL could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also
   reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. CGL with a
   depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35\% and
   inundation extents by 26.09-82.41\%, resulting in a slide of the exposed
   urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by
   0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of CGL varies
   spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of CGLs and a potential
   combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could
   help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising
   pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood
   mitigation measures.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of metals bound to suspended sediments in floods and on channel
   banks of the ephemeral Wadi Sekher, northern Negev desert, Israel}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{243-254}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the variation in the concentration of eight heavy
   metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr, Co, V, Sc) bound on suspended sediments
   during flow events and those deposited in channel banks. The study was
   undertaken in Wadi Sekher, an ephemeral flash-flood channel draining the
   Neot Hovav industrial chemical complex in the semi-arid northern Negev,
   Israel, at sites varying with bank height and distance from the
   industrial complex.
   Metal concentrations were found to be higher in the initial flow and
   recession than during peak flow. Bound metal concentrations were mainly
   affected by suspended sediment composition and concentrations. During
   peak flow the suspended sediment concentration rises and quartz sand is
   a major constituent. This leads to a decrease in bound metal
   concentrations, as the larger particles have a weaker affinity to
   binding. In six sediment samples, taken during the first 15 min of two
   floods, the bound metal concentrations changed similarly. These changes
   are suggested to represent variations in the source and cannot be
   attributed to dilution or binding effects.
   Six banks were sampled along Wadi Sekher, from the Neot Hovav
   hydrometric reach downstream to the confluence of Wadi Sekher and Wadi
   Beer-Sheva, at specified heights, following a bank-full flood. In every
   crosssection, a significant difference (p < 0.01) was seen in Cu, Cd,
   Co, V and Sc concentrations with bank height, with highest
   concentrations at bank-bed intersection. Downstream variations in bound
   metal concentrations along Wadi Sekher were statistically (p > 0.05)
   undifferentiated, indicating that the industrial area is not a source
   point for these metals, and that a constant input exists into the
   channel from tributaries along the channel.
   Due to the difficulty in sampling flash floods in ephemeral channels,
   existing data are not abundant, and our understanding of these
   environments is therefore limited. This study improves knowledge of
   interrelated variations in bound metal concentrations in fluvial
   deposits, in suspended sediment and in water during flash floods.}},
